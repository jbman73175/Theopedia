*Theopedia* is a community-driven online encyclopedia of biblical Christianity.

##What is our vision?

- To centralize the efforts of thousands of Christians into a comprehensive encyclopedia on biblical Christianity.
- To keep the articles at Theopedia free forever, and to give others broad freedoms to redistribute, publish, and adapt the content.
- To promote sound theology.
- To lessen the gap of theological knowledge between the seminary trained church leader and the layman.
- To build a Christian community for the promotion of good theological content.
- To promote the Lordship of Jesus Christ in all things.
