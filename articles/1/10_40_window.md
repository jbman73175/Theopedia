The **10/40 Window** refers to the section of Africa, Europe, and
Asia between 10 and 40 degrees north of the Equator. It encompasses
Saharan and Northern Africa, as well as almost all major Asian
nations other than Russia. Roughly two-thirds of the world
population lives in the 10/40 Window. The term was coined by
Christian missionary strategist Luis Bush to refer to the region of
the world with the least exposure to Christianity. The 10/40 Window
is populated by peoples who are predominantly
[Muslim](/Islam "Islam"), [Hindu](/Hinduism "Hinduism"),
[Buddhist](/Buddhism "Buddhism"),
[Animist](/index.php?title=Animism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Animism (page does not exist)"),
[Jewish](/Judaism "Judaism") and [Atheist](/Atheism "Atheism").
Many nations in the 10/40 Window are openly hostile to
[evangelization](/Evangelism "Evangelism") and Christianity.

According to missionary groups, 95% of people in the 10/40 Window
are unevangelized and 85% are considered among the poorest of the
world's poor.
