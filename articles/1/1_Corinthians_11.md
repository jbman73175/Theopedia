# Verses 2-16: The Headship and Glory of Christ

## Views

### Headship and Glory of Christ as declared in the Church

Some^[[1]](#note-0)^ take the position that this passage, although
talking about the head covering, the head covering itself is not to
be the primary emphasis. The point of this passage then is the
Headship (Authority) and Glory of Jesus Christ, and the role of the
believing man and woman in declaring that Headship and Glory above
all other authorities or glories. The way that Christ's Headship
and Glory are shown is by the divinely-implemented, symbolic,
culturally-universal covering of the head of the woman, and the
removal of any covering of the man.

The importance then is not in the covering itself, but the symbolic
nature of the thing that it covers, the physical head. In this
view, there are two types of "heads" in this passage. For example,
these two types can be seen in verse 4: "Every man who has
something on his [physical, bodily] head while praying or
prophesying disgraces his [spiritual] head" (NASB). The *first* is
the physical, bodily head of men and women, and the *second* is
what that physical, bodily head symbolically represents, which is
the spiritual head or authority. The man's physical, bodily head
symbolically represents the authority of Christ, and the woman's
physical, bodily head symbolically represents the authority of the
man.

With this understanding of the text, several implications can be
made depending upon how it is applied and implemented. Scenario
number 1 is the only correct application of this text according to
this view.

-   **Scenario \#1**: The man is uncovered, and the woman is
    covered. Because the man is uncovered, the authority of Christ and
    the glory of God is being seen. Because the woman is covered, she
    is hiding the authority of man and the glory of her hair so that
    only the authority of Christ and glory of God is seen.
-   **Scenario \#2**: The man is uncovered, and the woman is
    uncovered. Because the woman is uncovered, she is putting the
    authority of man and the glory of her hair on par with the
    authority of Christ and the glory of God.
-   **Scenario \#3**: The man is covered, and the woman is
    uncovered. Because the man is covered, he is symbolically covering
    Christ. Christ cannot be seen, but the authority of man and the
    glory of the woman is seen because the woman is uncovered.
-   **Scenario \#4**: The man is covered, and the woman is covered.
    The man is symbolically covering Christ and the woman is
    symbolically covering the authority of man and her glory. The goal
    of exalting the glory of God and the authority of Christ is not
    achieved.

### Submission of the Wife to the Husband in the Church

Some take the position that this passage is referring not to roles
of men and women in the church, but the submission of the wife to
the husband in the church. This is supported by reputable Bible
translations, like the ESV,^[[2]](#note-1)^ which translate the
Greek word for *woman* as *wife*.

#### Problems

Although the the Greek word γυνή can be translated as "wife," it
always depends upon the context. In
[1 Cor. 11](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=1Cor%2011;&version=;),
some argue that there is no contextual evidence to warrant a
narrower view of husband and wife rather than the broader
understanding of man and woman. Also, there is no mention of words
relating to submission. Words like "subject" are not used, where
they are used in other passages.

### What is the head covering?

-   Relatively long hair

Citing 1 Corinthians 11:5, some argue that relatively long hair is
the head covering Paul speaks of.
-   A symbol distinct from hair itself

Others assert that it is a sort of shawl, arguing that Paul seems
to be comparing long hair with a head covering instead of equating
long hair and head covering.
### What is the condemned custom?

-   Absence of head covering when she prays or prophesies

1 Corinthians 11:5 "...every wife who prays or prophesies with her
head uncovered dishonors her head. "
-   Being contentious

"Paul concluded with words which should be definitive about the
matter. In keeping with holding the authoritative headship
instruction, yet imitating him in not offending for the sake of the
gospel, please observe his (actual, not our expected) conclusion:
we have no such custom (of a head covering requirement).

## Does it apply to us today?

### Four views

The words of
[Daniel B. Wallace](http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=1202):

1.  This text has **no applicability** to us today. Paul is
    speaking about a ‘tradition’ that he has handed on. Hence, since
    this is not the tradition of the modern church, we hardly need to
    consider this text.
2.  The head covering is the **hair**. Hence, the applicability
    today is that women should wear (relatively) long hair.
3.  The head covering is a **real head covering** and the text is
    **applicable today**, in the same way as it was in Paul’s day.
    Within this view are two basic sub-views:
4.  \#The head covering is to be worn by all women in the church
    service.
5.  \#The head covering is to be worn by women in the church
    service only when praying or prophesying publicly.
6.  The head covering is a **meaningful symbol** in the ancient
    world that needs some sort of corresponding symbol today, but not
    necessarily a head covering. This also involves the same two
    sub-views as \#3 above.
