"[T]his passage cannot mean absolute silence is required from the
women because three chapters earlier, women who pray or prophesy
are taught about the demeanor they are required to have if they do
these things. In a meeting of the congregation, nothing is more
apparent than the fact that women had and have the right to pray
publicly, and, if the Spirit was upon them, to deliver a prophetic
word. So whatever Paul is prohibiting later, he is not prohibiting
these forms of verbal participation."
