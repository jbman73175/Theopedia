In the first 6 chapters of 1 Corinthians, Paul is giving some
strong reproof to the church that he had founded on his previous
missionary journey. News had apparently reached the apostle about
some problems among the believers in Corinth. He spends a
considerable portion of his letter (the first 4 chapters in our
English text) exposing their division and the root causes and
ultimate effects of it. He then moves on to three different
individual sins that are besetting the congregation. In chapter 5,
he addresses the failure of the church to properly discipline a
member engaged in an incestuous relationship. Chapter 6 opens with
the issue of church members suing one another and closes with an
argument against the practice of another aspect of sexual
immorality involving prostitutes. In the midst of these three
rebukes stands a three-fold reminder of the new life, new behavior
and new standing the Corinthians ought to be enjoying.

## Analysis of 1 Corinthians 6:9-20

### The Unrighteous Shall Not Inherit the Kingdom

(I Corinthians 6:9-10)

Paul begins the transition from his discussion of frivolous
lawsuits back into the topic of sexual immorality with a rhetorical
device that is becoming familiar to the readers of the letter. The
phrase "know you not that...?" occurs ten times in I Corinthians
and only once in the rest of Paul's epistles. He has already
employed it in 3:16 and 5:6 and uses it a total of six times in
this chapter alone. Given their own interest in wisdom and
knowledge, the writer turns to this sarcasm less to provide a
reminder of something he had previously told them and more to point
to something they already should know inherently.^[[1]](#note-0)^

The reality which should have been understood by the Corinthian
church was that the unrighteous or the unjust have no part in the
kingdom of God. Paul's purpose is not to list sins that will cause
one to be disinherited, rather to catalog the major types of sins
that characterize wicked societies such as the one in which his
readers dwelt.^[[2]](#note-1)^ He uses nouns as labels that
indicate a persistent pattern, making it plain that he is not
referring to individual acts or temporary lapses of this behavior.
Six of these are repeated from 5:11, including the "immoral person"
(fornicator), the covetous, the idolater, the reviler, the drunkard
and the swindler. To these he adds three other types of sexual
sins, including the adulterer, the effeminate and the homosexual,
as well as one other sin of greed, the thief. It is interesting to
note here that the same three temptations that were presented to
Eve in the garden are represented in this list. According to I John
2:16, these can be categorized as "the lust of the flesh and the
lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life"

To the general notion of sexual immorality, Paul adds levels of
definition and clarity to end the word games the Corinthians
enjoyed playing. The word adulterers refers specifically to married
people indulging in sexuality outside the marriage relationship.
The word effeminate, also translated as male prostitutes, carries a
root meaning of soft, luxurious or dainty. ^[[3]](#note-2)^ But
here it used in a much darker way, most likely referring to the
more passive partner in a homosexual relationship. ^[[4]](#note-3)^
The word homosexuals, also translated sodomites, is not frequently
used in other literature as it is derived from a compound of male
and a vulgar slang for intercourse. The context of the verse leads
the reader to assume a reference to the more active partner in
homosexuality.^[[5]](#note-4)^ The word drunkards is a
self-explanatory addition to these "lusts of the flesh".

The following verse moves on to the "lust of the eyes," listing
three types of selfish behavior. The word thieves follows naturally
from a discussion of lawsuits, as would the covetous and the
swindlers. The covetous person wants something that belongs to
someone else, while the swindler takes unfair advantage of others
to trick them out of it and the thief simply takes it
outright.^[[6]](#note-5)^ In any case, these people are clearly
dissatisfied with their lot in life and are caught up in a way of
life alien to the kingdom of God.^[[7]](#note-6)^

The final category of sins - the "boastful pride of life" - is less
represented in this list but nonetheless present. In the midst of
the fleshly sins in 6:10 Paul includes idolaters, referring to
anyone worshiping false gods or caught up in a false religious
system.^[[8]](#note-7)^ The Greek word for revilers has a root
related to the word for mischief and carries a connotation of
slander and blasphemy. (Zodhiates) Throughout his writings, Paul
speaks in no uncertain terms of the severity of the sins committed
with the tongue. He ends his list by repeating the warning that
those who persist in such things will not inherit the kingdom of
God. As is usually the case, the apostle does not end with the
warning, but moves on to exhort and encourage the Corinthians that
such was not the case for them. He continues in the following verse
to provide hope.

### But You Were...

(I Corinthians 6:12)

The key in this verse seems to be the three-fold use of the strong
adversative particle "but," which adds emphasis to the theme of
"once you were, but now you are not."^[[9]](#note-8)^ First, the
writer reminds his readers that some (not all) of them were in the
past full participants in this lifestyle against which he had just
so strongly warned. Apparently, some of them were still not living
any differently from those excluded from the kingdom. Paul provides
a series of theological facts as a basis for the implied command to
stop being like the wicked.^[[10]](#note-9)^ His argument can be
distilled to the statement, "you are different, now act like it!"

The three verbs used to describe what should have been a present
reality for the Corinthians form somewhat of a primer in
soteriological language. The first phrase but you were washed
speaks of the new life that is received through spiritual cleansing
and regeneration.^[[11]](#note-10)^ The apostle uses similar
wording in Titus 3:5 where he reminds us that Jesus "saved us, not
on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but
according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing
by the Holy Spirit." The second phrase but you were sanctified
speaks of the new behavior which a transformed life always
produces.^[[12]](#note-11)^ In Romans 6:22, Paul says, "... having
been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit,
resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life." The
third phrase but you were justified speaks of the new standing
before God.^[[13]](#note-12)^ This imputed righteousness is the
theme of another of the author's letters. In Romans 5:1-2 he
asserts that, "having been justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ."

As a grammatical aside, it should be noted that of these three
verbs used to describe the new life, behavior and standing of the
believer, all are in the aorist tense, indicating an action
occurring in past time. However, the second two verbs sanctified
and justified are in the passive voice, indicating that the subject
receives the action of the verb, but the first verb washed is in
the middle voice, indicating the subject acting on his own behalf,
or participating in the results of the verbal action. (Zodhiates)
The ramification of these nuances of language, although undoubtedly
profitable and worthy of investigating, are nonetheless beyond the
scope of this analysis.

Paul draws this passage of encouragement to a close with an
implicit reference to the triune nature of God as the agent of
change for the believers in Corinth. Scholars are not in unilateral
agreement about the parallelism between the three aspects of
conversion and the three-fold agency. The clarity of the structure
is somewhat clouded by the use of only two prepositional phrases to
modify the activity rather than three. What is clear, however, is
an understanding of what God has done for the believers by the work
of Jesus Christ and in the believers by the work of the Holy
Spirit.^[[14]](#note-13)^ With this transitional exhortation
complete, Paul is ready to turn his attention back to the arena of
sexual ethics in the church.

### Power to Act, Under the Power of None

(I Corinthians 6:12)

After dealing with the problem of the incestuous man in 5:1-13 and
the problem of the church "airing its dirty laundry" in 6:1-8, the
apostle now addresses the problem of men in the Christian community
arguing for the right to go to the prostitutes. The port city of
Corinth was well-known in the ancient world for the materialism and
immorality associated not only with its favorable business location
but also with the temple of Aphrodite.^[[15]](#note-14)^ Whether
the temple prostitutes literally numbered one thousand is
irrelevant; it is sufficient to say that sexual promiscuity and
licentious behavior in general ran rampant in the city and was
wreaking havoc in the church as well. Apparently some of the
contemporary phraseology had been employed among the believers to
justify their own immoral behavior. Their defense demonstrates not
only the problem of tainting Godly wisdom with worldly philosophy,
but also belies a faulty understanding of Christian liberty and the
relationship between body and spirit. Paul takes up the counter
argument by turning some of their own catchphrases against them.

The arguments that Paul begins to mount in this section differ in
style from the previous teaching on incest and lawsuits in that
here he starts to attack not their behavior but rather the theology
behind it.^[[16]](#note-15)^ "All things are lawful for me" is
possibly a phrase that started with Paul and had become twisted
over time. It certainly could have been misinterpreted by the
Corinthian people if they had been exposed to his teaching to the
Galatians. Whether it originated from Paul or elsewhere, he quickly
and sharply corrects their error and brings it in harmony with the
law of love.

He reminds them first that the more important question is not "is
it permitted?" but rather "is it profitable?" Several chapters
later, the apostle repeats the phrase and adds to it the question
"will it edify?" (10:23) The implication in his first qualifier is
that the use of liberty ought to be others-oriented. His second
qualifier reminds the believer that even though he has freedom,
subjecting oneself to sin is not freedom at all but rather slavery.
Paul's creative wordplay with exousia might be better captured in
the English as "even though I have power to act in all things, I
will not be overpowered by the one thing."^[[17]](#note-16)^ To
allow oneself to be mastered by something, particularly as it
relates to the sexual sin that he will now turn to deal with,
certainly does not demonstrate a proper Biblical understanding of
love for self.

### The Body for the Lord, the Lord for the Body

(I Corinthians 6:13-14)

The second phrase that Paul takes issue with is another expression
of liberty, this time pertaining to foods. Literally translated
"meats for the belly and the belly for meats," this slogan
expresses a biological truth about a purely physical and thus
temporal relationship between food and our
bodies.^[[18]](#note-17)^ It is possible that the slogan also
included the idea that God will do away with both of them, or that
Paul added this thought on his own. However, the believers in
Corinth apparently had taken this slogan and extended this idea to
include all aspects of physical endeavors, including sexual
relationships. They reasoned that all bodily appetites are
essentially alike, therefore the body is for sex and sex is for the
body.^[[19]](#note-18)^ They used this fallacious analogy to
rationalize their illicit sexual practices, including visiting the
temple prostitutes, which the apostle addresses directly in the
verses to follow. However, Paul asserts that they are wrong on both
counts, saying "the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord,
and the Lord for the body."

He continues by explaining that in the same way as God raised the
Lord, so he will raise us up. MacArthur explains, "Our bodies are
designed not only to serve in this life but in the life to
come."^[[20]](#note-19)^ This verse lends strong support for the
physical resurrection of the body, a concept which Paul will
further address later in the letter. However, in connection with
this teaching on sexual sin it reminds the reader that the physical
nature of our human bodies is not limited to our earthly
experience. Jesus himself demonstrated this in His own glorified
body by eating and drinking with the disciples following His
resurrection.

### Members of Christ, Joined to the Lord

(I Corinthians 6:15-17)

The apostle continues to elucidate the relationship between body
and spirit by offering two premises and drawing the necessary
conclusion. The first premise is that our bodies are "members of
Christ," a principle echoed in Romans when teaching on the
responsibility of believers toward the church and again in his
letter to the Ephesians in his discourse on the responsibility of
believers toward their spouses. The second premise draws on the Old
Testament teaching that in sexual intercourse two bodies become one
flesh. The case is stated strongly that the one who cleaves to a
prostitute is one body with her, but the one who cleaves to the
Lord is united to Him spiritually. The parallel construction used
in the writing continues to break down the flawed perspective on
the separation of body and spirit. The
[chiastic](Chiasmus "Chiasmus") argument is formed as follows:

> A Their bodies are members of Christ's body;  
> B therefore, they may not be members of a prostitute's.  
> B' Joined to a prostitute they become one body with her;  
> A' joined to Christ they become one spirit with Him.

The logical conclusion is that since both are bodily relationships
and both imply a union, the two relationships are mutually
exclusive.^[[21]](#note-20)^ One commentator further states that
prostitution "creates the grotesque connection of the One who
represents ultimate commitment with the act the represents the most
casual of sexual relationships."^[[22]](#note-21)^

### Flee Fornication

(I Corinthians 6:18)

To this point, Paul has been arguing toward an inherent prohibition
to the theologically untenable practice of visiting prostitutes.
What should have been obvious through reason and intuition, he will
now make explicitly clear. "Flee fornication!" begins his next
thought. This present imperative is followed by yet another gem of
current Corinthian culture that the apostle seeks to refute. In
many English translations, the phrase is rendered "Every other sin
that a man commits is outside the body." However, the word other is
neither in the original Greek, nor entirely correct. Obviously
there are other sins such as gluttony and drunkenness that are
committed against one's own body, so Paul either would have had to
employ hyperbole or imply something else. Lowery points to the
similar construction with that of verse 13 to suggest that this
phrase was quoted to support their
[epicurean](Epicureanism "Epicureanism") ways.^[[23]](#note-22)^
The notion is consistent with their false understanding of dualism
in making a distinction between body and spirit.

However, the apostle again turns their thinking around and asserts
that sexual sin, perhaps in a way totally unlike other sins, has a
corruptive and destructive impact on the physical body. MacArthur
states that "although sexual sin is not necessarily the worst sin,
it is the most unique in its character."^[[24]](#note-23)^ Byrne
notes that the one who sins sexually "perverts precisely that
faculty within himself that is meant to be the instrument of the
most intimate bodily communication between
persons."^[[25]](#note-24)^ Perhaps Paul is considering this
gravity, or possibly reminding us of Joseph's response (Genesis
39:12) with his strong command to flee this most unique and serious
sin.

### The Dwelling Place of God, the Redeemed of God

(I Corinthians 6:19-20)

Paul closes out this section of teaching on sexual immorality by
employing two more metaphors to help the Corinthians better
understand the relationship between the physical and the spiritual.
First he returns to the image of the temple which he first referred
to in 3:16. However, where initially he addressed them in the
plural so as to say "you yourselves collectively are a temple,"
here he uses the singular to say "your individual body is a
temple." The word used is the Greek *naos*, referring not just to
the temple area, but specifically to the Holy of Holies, the very
dwelling place of God.^[[26]](#note-25)^ This reality of Christians
as the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit is echoed not only by Paul, but
also by Jesus through John in his gospel (7:38-39; 20:22) and
through Luke in Acts 1:8. The repugnant thought of committing
sexual sin in a church auditorium should give us the same sense of
offense regardless of location of the act.^[[27]](#note-26)^

The last image he uses to drive his point home is that of slavery.
Paul uses the Greek word agorazo to say that we were "bought with a
price." This uses marketplace terminology to indicate that the one
who bought us has the right of possession. (Zodhiates) He takes us
back to the opening of his argument, closing the loop that began
with the concept of liberty. The apostle makes the point that
Christ purchased us for God, and that our body was included in that
purchase.^[[28]](#note-27)^ Therefore, we were not redeemed to
freedom, as would have been argued by the phrase "all things are
lawful," but rather for slavery to the will of God, demonstrated by
the phrase "you are not your own."

This section - as well as the entire argument - is drawn together
by a final imperative. The positive side of the prohibition do not
use the body for illicit sexual relationships is the command do use
the body to glorify God. Our bodies, having been made members of
Christ, joined together in one spirit, built into a dwelling place
for the Holy Spirit and purchased by the very blood of the Son of
God, have one purpose: to glorify God. The apostle Peter may have
had this passage in mind as he wrote in his first letter:

> "As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts
> which were yours in your ignorance, but like the Holy One who
> called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because
> it is written, 'YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.' If you address
> as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one's
> work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on
> earth; knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things
> like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from
> your forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished
> and spotless, the blood of Christ."

### Conclusion

At some times with a scalpel and at other times with a
sledgehammer, Paul carefully and completely dissects and destroys
the foolish thinking of the Corinthians. By turning their truisms
upside down he makes it clear that what we do in our physical,
temporal bodies has spiritual and eternal significance. Therefore
we ought to glorify God with our bodies.
