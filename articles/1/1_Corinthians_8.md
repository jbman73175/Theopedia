Much confusion has arisen over looking simply looking at this one
verse (right from the beginning of the chapter Paul says that there
is no God but one). But it is clear even from the verse itself that
other "true" deities are not in view. When it says "that are
called," it's saying that some people are calling them "god," but
just because they do doesn't make them "god."

For though there be *that are called* gods, whether in heaven or in
earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) (KJV)
The newer English translations are even clearer in their expression
of modern english, although the King James Version is just fine for
demonstrating that point.

For although there may be *so-called* gods in heaven or on earth—as
indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords"— (ESV)
