### 2

*"...and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us..." (NASB)*

### 3

*"...that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ." (ESV)*

"When John wants to cultivate fellowship with a group of people, he
writes them a letter filled with theology. When Paul wanted to
prepare a missionary fellowship to support him and send him on to
Spain, he wrote a theological book called Romans. The deeper and
stronger you want your fellowship to be the more theology must be
shared."

### 4

*"These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete." (NASB)*

"[M]ore of God can be experienced in the fellowship of the saints
(Cf.
[Psalm 16:1-3](index.php?title=Psalm_16&action=edit&redlink=1 "Psalm 16 (page does not exist)")).
If this were not true, the longing for fellowship would be
idolatry. Our joy in God's fellowship is made complete in the joy
that others have in God's fellowship."

### 6

*"If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth..." (NASB)*

This is the negative implication of verse 5.

### 7

*"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin." (ESV)*

This is the positive implication of verse 5.

### 8

*"If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us." (NASB)*

This serves as a clarification of verses 7-8.

*Contrast with [Christian perfection](Christian_perfection "Christian perfection").*

### 9

*"If we [confess](Confession_of_Sins "Confession of Sins") our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (ESV)*

### 10

*"If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us." (NASB)*
