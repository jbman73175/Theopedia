## Who does the "world" refer to?

1 John 2:2 is a favorite for argument from some theological
positions. As [A. W. Pink](A._W._Pink "A. W. Pink") put it, "This
is the passage which, apparently, most favors the Arminian view of
the Atonement [...]." Bruce Ware represents this position, at least
regarding this specific passage,

> Notice that ‘world’ occurs 28 times in 1 John, 26 of which are used
> either in a comprehensive sense (e.g., 1 John 2:17; 3:17; 4:1, 9)
> or more narrowly as the world of the unsaved (e.g., 1 John 2:15-16;
> 3:1, 13; 5:19). This makes doubtful that 2:2 and 4:14 refer to a
> world of the elect.

Regarding this passage taken as referring to the whole world, when
isolated, Pink writes, "[...] yet if it be considered attentively
it will be seen that it does so only in appearance, and not in
reality."

## Hermeneutics

It is a necessary component of interpretation to know how words are
used, which includes studying their various uses in different
context, which Ware did; however one must also examine the use of
the words at hand in their own context, which Ware fails to do.

Key to every interpretative act is, instead of “proof texting” (by
isolating verses out of their textual, temporal, ideological, and
cultural contexts, or interpreting merely single words throughout
Scripture rather than comparing their use in entire contexts
between texts), is rather to recognize the context, insofar as it
is possible; this includes referring to the other writings an
author of any particularly questioned portion of text, (in this
case being John, in the context of “Johannine literature”).
Furthermore, as conservative Christian theologians have long
affirmed,
[Scripture interprets Scripture](Analogy_of_faith "Analogy of faith"),
since it is God-breathed, and therefore cannot be
self-contradictory.

"In Galatians 2:9 we are told that John, together with James and
Cephas, were apostles "unto the circumcision [(the Jews)]" (Pink).
Thus Galatians 2:9 provides to us who it is that is John's primary
audience; other details of this letter confirm this notion: (Pink)

-   **(a)** In the opening verse he says of Christ, "Which we have
    seen with our eyes . . . . and our hands have handled." How
    impossible it would have been for the Apostle Paul to have
    commenced any of his epistles to Gentile saints with such language!
-   **(b)** "Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an
    old commandment which ye had from the beginning" (1 John 2:7). The
    "beginning" here referred to is the beginning of the public
    manifestation of Christ-in proof compare 1 John 1:1, 2:13, etc. Now
    these believers the apostle tells us, had the "old commandment"
    from the beginning. This was true of Jewish believers, but it was
    not true of Gentile believers.
-   **(c)** "I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known Him
    from the beginning" (1 John 2:13). Here, again, it is evident that
    it is Jewish believers that are in view.
-   **(d)** "Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have
    heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many
    antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went
    out from us, but they were not of us" (1 John 2:18, 19).

These brethren to whom John wrote had "heard" from Christ Himself
that Antichrist should come (see Matthew 24). The "many
antichrists" whom John declares "went out from us" were all Jews,
for during the first century none but a Jew posed as the Messiah.
Therefore, when John says "He is the propitiation for our sins" he
can only mean for the sins of Jewish believers.\*

It is even enlightening to know that the opening of John's gospel
begins with using the word “logos” as a theological term which was
well-developed from LXX reading Jewry, corresponding to an Hebrew
equivalent term in use among Hebrew speaking Jews. (The term had,
at this time, a well-developed theological element. [Marlowe]) In
Acts it is reported there was a hard time with accepting that
Gentiles were also included in the Messiah's salvation, though they
gloried God for it. In the Epistles of Paul we see tensions between
these Gentile believers and Judaizers-legalistic Jews that Paul
contended were not Christians, but self-glorying holders of another
gospel. This is reflective, however, of the proud Jewish
Nationalism of first century Judaism, against which prominent men
like Josephus gave warning, by which a revolt was emboldened, and
for which Jerusalem and the nation of Israel were eventually
destroyed and scattered into a diaspora by Rome. This same attitude
is evident when the overzealous Jews attempt to make Jesus King by
force (John 6:15), and in the loaded questions Jesus was asked
regarding taxes (Matt 22:17). Contrary to this racial mindset, Paul
writes against the thought of division between Jew and gentile,
that in Christ the wall of enmity between Jew and Gentile are
broken down (Eph 2:11-22, Romans 4:12 & Gal 6:16). Instead both are
now included in the family of God as members of the commonwealth of
Israel and inheritors of the covenants of promise, as fellow
citizens with the Saints, of God's household, (Eph 2:11-22).
Similarily, John also writes against this Jewish Racial-Nationalism
in his gospel (John 11:51-52), to which the pattern of 1 John 2:2
conforms:

John 11:51-52
1 John 2:2
he prophesied that
And
Jesus
He Himself
would die for
is the propitiation for
the nation
our sins
and not for the nation only
and not for ours only
but also
but also
that he would gather together in one
for
the children of God scattered abroad
the whole world
Furthermore, since Christians first interpret Scripture in light of
Scripture, it is enlightening to examine other texts on the topic
for whom Jesus died, for which a few of many examples follow:

-   John 10:26 - Not all are his sheep (see context of John
    10:11-10:26, or better yet, read the entire book straight through!)
-   John 17:6-10 - Jesus explicitly says that he prays not for the
    whole world, but for the apostles and those who'd believe Him
    through their word.
-   Ephesians 5:25, 26 - Laid down his life for the Church, not the
    whole world:
-   Revelation 5:9 - Some of all in the world
