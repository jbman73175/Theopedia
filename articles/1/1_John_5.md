## Overcoming the World (1-5)

\1. Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God:
 and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
 begotten of him.

A more literal translation of verse 1a from the Greek would be:
"*Everyone believing* (present participle) that Jesus is the Christ
*has been born* (perfect tense) of God. (Cf. [ESV](ESV "ESV"))
This verse clearly indicates that the present state of "believing"
is the result of having been born of God. This is consistent with
(and is direct support for) the Reformed doctrine that regeneration
*precedes* faith.
\2. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love
 God, and keep his commandments.

\3. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and
 his commandments are not grievous.

\4. For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is
 the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

\5. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that
 Jesus is the Son of God?

## Testimony Concerning the Son of God (6-12)

\6. This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not
 by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that
 beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.

\7. For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the
 Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

\8. And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and
 the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

\9. If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is
 greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of
 his Son.

\10. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in
 himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he
 believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.

\11. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal
 life, and this life is in his Son.

\12. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son
 of God hath not life.

## That You May Know (13-21)

\13. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name
 of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and
 that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

\14. And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we
 ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:

\15. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know
 that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

\16. If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death,
 he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto
 death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray
 for it.

    by Irvin A. Busenitz; also in
    [pdf.](http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj1b.pdf)

-   The
    [Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")
    says:

"Prayer is to be made for things lawful, and for all sorts of men
living, or that shall live hereafter: but not for the dead, nor for
those of whom it may be known that they have sinned the sin unto
death." (Chapter 21)
[[1]](http://www.reformed.com/rpcna-constitution/ct_chp21.htm)
\17. All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto
 death.

\18. We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that
 is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth
 him not.

\19. And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
 wickedness.

\20. And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
 understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him
 that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God,
 and eternal life.

\21. Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
