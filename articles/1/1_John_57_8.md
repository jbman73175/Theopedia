This is considered one of the more difficult passages of the New
Testament to exegete.

KJV Text:

"For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the
Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. And there are
three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and
the blood: and these three agree in one."

"It is probably best to see these as references to Jesus' power to
make alive (Spirit), cleanse the believer from sin (water) and
atone (blood). There is support for this symbolism in the Gospel of
John (6:63, 13:10) and in 1 John (1:7, 2:2). It is also supported
from the Old Testament prophecy of Zech 12:10â€“13:1, part of which
is quoted in John 19:37. But how does all this relate to the
author's debate with the opponents? If (as we have suggested
previously) the debate centered over the saving significance of
what Jesus did during his earthly life and ministry (especially his
death on the cross), then the continuing presence of Jesus' power
in the church to which the author is writing is experienced by
believers as they are made alive (by the Spirit), cleansed from
their sins (represented by water) and reconciled to God (by Jesus'
death on the cross). These three things are witnesses because
although the opponents can deny the apostolic eyewitness testimony
regarding the importance of Jesus' earthly life and ministry they
cannot deny the present effects of Jesus' actions in the lives of
believers within the congregation." -W. Hall Harris III
