### 9

*"The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance." (ESV)*
To whom is Peter refering when he says, "but [he] is patient toward
**you**..."? The general Calvinistic interpretation is as follows:
Peter is speaking "to those who have obtained a faith of equal
standing with ours..." (1:1) "This is now the second letter that I
am writing to you, beloved." (2 Peter 3:1) The first letter was
addressed as follows: "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those
who are electâ€¦" (1 Peter 1:1) "Christ's second coming has been
delayed so that all the elect can be gathered in."
