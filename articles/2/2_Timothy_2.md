### 2:3-4

***"Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him"([ESV](ESV "ESV"))***
The metaphors of the Christian as a soldier, and of the Christian
life being called a fight are common in the [Pauline](Paul "Paul")
epistles (cf. Philippians 2:25, 1 Timothy 6:12, 2 Timothy 4:7,
Philemon 1:2).

### 2:5

***"An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules."([ESV](ESV "ESV"))***
The crown in this instance is the wreath of laurels awarded to the
athlete who wins the race. This metaphor was previsously used by
Paul more expansively in 1 Corinthians 9:24-27

"Do you not know that
*in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize*?
So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control
in all things. They do it to receive a *perishable wreath*, but we
an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one
beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under
control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be
*disqualified*."
The image of the crown appears a number of times in the New
Testament, often representing a reward:

-   Philippians 4:1 "Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long
    for, my joy and *crown*, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved."
-   1 Thessalonians 2:19 "For what is our hope or joy or
    *crown of boasting* before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not
    you?"
-   2 Timothy 4:8 "Henceforth there is laid up for me the
    *crown of righteousness*, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will
    award to me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who
    have loved his appearing."
-   James 1:12 "Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under
    trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the
    *crown of life*, which God has promised to those who love him."
-   1 Peter 5:4 "And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will
    receive the unfading *crown of glory*."
-   Revelation 2:10 "... Be faithful unto death, and I will give
    you the *crown of life*."
-   Revelation 3:11 "I am coming soon. Hold fast what you have, so
    that no one may seize your *crown*."

Similar to the soldier metaphor, the metaphor of the Christian as
an athlete, running a race, is common in the Pauline epistles:

-   1 Corinthians 9:24-27 (above)
-   Galatians 2:2 "... in order to make sure I was
    *not running or had not run* in vain."
-   Philippians 2:16 "holding fast to the word of life, so that in
    the day of Christ I may be proud that I did *not run in vain* or
    labor in vain."
-   2 Timothy 4:7 "I have fought the good fight, I have
    *finished the race*, I have kept the faith."

## 2:6

***"It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops.([ESV](ESV "ESV"))"***
Following the metaphors of the Christian as the solider and the
athlete, comes the Christian as the farmer.

The Lord [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") described gospel workers as workers
in the harvest field (cf. Matthew 9:35-38, Luke 10:2). (In Matthew
13, he also described the end of the age as a harvest, and the
angels as harvesters. This is a similar sounding, but very
different meaning image).

Paul uses the same metaphor elsewhere:

-   Romans 1:13 "...in order that I might have a harvest among you
    ..."
-   Galatians 6:9 "Let us not become weary in doing good, for at
    the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up."
