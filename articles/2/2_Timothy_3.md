"'**All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,'**"
(ESV^[[1]](#note-0)^)
The scriptures are not simply great human writing, but are
"breathed out" by God. "The Holy Writings were not seen as merely
revelatory of God’s Word, they were seen as synonymous with God’s
Word, such that God said what the Scriptures
said."^[[2]](#note-1)^
