"'**I charge you in the presence of [God](God "God") and of [Christ Jesus](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching.'**"
(ESV)
This is a solemn charge from [Paul](Paul "Paul") to Timothy to
[preach](Preaching "Preaching") the [gospel](Gospel "Gospel").
Timothy is to be ready to preach not just when it is convenient,
but when it is difficult and uncomfortable, or when people don't
want to listen.
