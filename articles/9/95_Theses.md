The **95 Theses**, a document written by
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") in 1517, challenged
the teachings of the Catholic Church on the nature of penance, the
authority of the pope and the usefulness of indulgences. It sparked
a theological debate that fueled the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation") and subsequently resulted
in the birth of [Protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism") and
the [Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran"),
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed"), and
[Anabaptist](Anabaptist "Anabaptist") traditions within
Christianity.

Luther's action was in great part a response to the selling of
indulgences by Johann Tetzel, a Dominican priest, commissioned by
the Archbishop of Mainz and Pope Leo X. The purpose of this
fundraising campaign was to finance the building of St. Peter's
Basilica in Rome. Even though Luther's prince, Frederick the Wise,
and the prince of the neighboring territory, George, Duke of
Saxony, forbade the sale in their lands, Luther's parishioners
traveled to purchase them. When these people came to confession,
they presented the plenary indulgence, claiming they no longer had
to repent of their sins, since the document promised to forgive all
their sins.

Luther is said to have posted the 95 Theses on the door of the
Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, on October 31, 1517. Church
doors functioned very much as bulletin boards function on a
twenty-first century college campus. The 95 Theses were quickly
translated into German, widely copied and printed. Within two weeks
they had spread throughout Germany, and within two months
throughout Europe. This was one of the first events in history that
was profoundly affected by the printing press, which made the
distribution of documents and ideas easier and more wide-spread.

## Text of the 95 Theses

**Disputation of Doctor Martin Luther  
on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences  
  
by Dr. Martin Luther, 1517**
Out of love for the truth and the desire to bring it to light, the
following propositions will be discussed at Wittenberg, under the
presidency of the Reverend Father Martin Luther, Master of Arts and
of Sacred Theology, and Lecturer in Ordinary on the same at that
place. Wherefore he requests that those who are unable to be
present and debate orally with us, may do so by letter.

In the Name our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

1.  Our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, when He said Poenitentiam
    agite, willed that the whole life of believers should be
    repentance.
2.  This word cannot be understood to mean sacramental penance,
    i.e., confession and satisfaction, which is administered by the
    priests.
3.  Yet it means not inward repentance only; nay, there is no
    inward repentance which does not outwardly work divers
    mortifications of the flesh.
4.  The penalty [of sin], therefore, continues so long as hatred of
    self continues; for this is the true inward repentance, and
    continues until our entrance into the kingdom of heaven.
5.  The pope does not intend to remit, and cannot remit any
    penalties other than those which he has imposed either by his own
    authority or by that of the Canons.
6.  The pope cannot remit any guilt, except by declaring that it
    has been remitted by God and by assenting to God's remission;
    though, to be sure, he may grant remission in cases reserved to his
    judgment. If his right to grant remission in such cases were
    despised, the guilt would remain entirely unforgiven.
7.  God remits guilt to no one whom He does not, at the same time,
    humble in all things and bring into subjection to His vicar, the
    priest.
8.  The penitential canons are imposed only on the living, and,
    according to them, nothing should be imposed on the dying.
9.  Therefore the Holy Spirit in the pope is kind to us, because in
    his decrees he always makes exception of the article of death and
    of necessity.
10. Ignorant and wicked are the doings of those priests who, in the
    case of the dying, reserve canonical penances for purgatory.
11. This changing of the canonical penalty to the penalty of
    purgatory is quite evidently one of the tares that were sown while
    the bishops slept.
12. In former times the canonical penalties were imposed not after,
    but before absolution, as tests of true contrition.
13. The dying are freed by death from all penalties; they are
    already dead to canonical rules, and have a right to be released
    from them.
14. The imperfect health [of soul], that is to say, the imperfect
    love, of the dying brings with it, of necessity, great fear; and
    the smaller the love, the greater is the fear.
15. This fear and horror is sufficient of itself alone (to say
    nothing of other things) to constitute the penalty of purgatory,
    since it is very near to the horror of despair.
16. Hell, purgatory, and heaven seem to differ as do despair,
    almost-despair, and the assurance of safety.
17. With souls in purgatory it seems necessary that horror should
    grow less and love increase.
18. It seems unproved, either by reason or Scripture, that they are
    outside the state of merit, that is to say, of increasing love.
19. Again, it seems unproved that they, or at least that all of
    them, are certain or assured of their own blessedness, though we
    may be quite certain of it.
20. Therefore by "full remission of all penalties" the pope means
    not actually "of all," but only of those imposed by himself.
21. Therefore those preachers of indulgences are in error, who say
    that by the pope's indulgences a man is freed from every penalty,
    and saved;
22. Whereas he remits to souls in purgatory no penalty which,
    according to the canons, they would have had to pay in this life.
23. If it is at all possible to grant to any one the remission of
    all penalties whatsoever, it is certain that this remission can be
    granted only to the most perfect, that is, to the very fewest.
24. It must needs be, therefore, that the greater part of the
    people are deceived by that indiscriminate and highsounding promise
    of release from penalty.
25. The power which the pope has, in a general way, over purgatory,
    is just like the power which any bishop or curate has, in a special
    way, within his own diocese or parish.
26. The pope does well when he grants remission to souls [in
    purgatory], not by the power of the keys (which he does not
    possess), but by way of intercession.
27. They preach man who say that so soon as the penny jingles into
    the money-box, the soul flies out [of purgatory].
28. It is certain that when the penny jingles into the money-box,
    gain and avarice can be increased, but the result of the
    intercession of the Church is in the power of God alone.
29. Who knows whether all the souls in purgatory wish to be bought
    out of it, as in the legend of Sts. Severinus and Paschal.
30. No one is sure that his own contrition is sincere; much less
    that he has attained full remission.
31. Rare as is the man that is truly penitent, so rare is also the
    man who truly buys indulgences, i.e., such men are most rare.
32. They will be condemned eternally, together with their teachers,
    who believe themselves sure of their salvation because they have
    letters of pardon.
33. Men must be on their guard against those who say that the
    pope's pardons are that inestimable gift of God by which man is
    reconciled to Him;
34. For these "graces of pardon" concern only the penalties of
    sacramental satisfaction, and these are appointed by man.
35. They preach no Christian doctrine who teach that contrition is
    not necessary in those who intend to buy souls out of purgatory or
    to buy confessionalia.
36. Every truly repentant Christian has a right to full remission
    of penalty and guilt, even without letters of pardon.
37. Every true Christian, whether living or dead, has part in all
    the blessings of Christ and the Church; and this is granted him by
    God, even without letters of pardon.
38. Nevertheless, the remission and participation [in the blessings
    of the Church] which are granted by the pope are in no way to be
    despised, for they are, as I have said, the declaration of divine
    remission.
39. It is most difficult, even for the very keenest theologians, at
    one and the same time to commend to the people the abundance of
    pardons and [the need of] true contrition.
40. True contrition seeks and loves penalties, but liberal pardons
    only relax penalties and cause them to be hated, or at least,
    furnish an occasion [for hating them].
41. Apostolic pardons are to be preached with caution, lest the
    people may falsely think them preferable to other good works of
    love.
42. Christians are to be taught that the pope does not intend the
    buying of pardons to be compared in any way to works of mercy.
43. Christians are to be taught that he who gives to the poor or
    lends to the needy does a better work than buying pardons;
44. Because love grows by works of love, and man becomes better;
    but by pardons man does not grow better, only more free from
    penalty.
45. Christians are to be taught that he who sees a man in need, and
    passes him by, and gives [his money] for pardons, purchases not the
    indulgences of the pope, but the indignation of God.
46. Christians are to be taught that unless they have more than
    they need, they are bound to keep back what is necessary for their
    own families, and by no means to squander it on pardons.
47. Christians are to be taught that the buying of pardons is a
    matter of free will, and not of commandment.
48. Christians are to be taught that the pope, in granting pardons,
    needs, and therefore desires, their devout prayer for him more than
    the money they bring.
49. Christians are to be taught that the pope's pardons are useful,
    if they do not put their trust in them; but altogether harmful, if
    through them they lose their fear of God.
50. Christians are to be taught that if the pope knew the exactions
    of the pardon-preachers, he would rather that St. Peter's church
    should go to ashes, than that it should be built up with the skin,
    flesh and bones of his sheep.
51. Christians are to be taught that it would be the pope's wish,
    as it is his duty, to give of his own money to very many of those
    from whom certain hawkers of pardons cajole money, even though the
    church of St. Peter might have to be sold.
52. The assurance of salvation by letters of pardon is vain, even
    though the commissary, nay, even though the pope himself, were to
    stake his soul upon it.
53. They are enemies of Christ and of the pope, who bid the Word of
    God be altogether silent in some Churches, in order that pardons
    may be preached in others.
54. Injury is done the Word of God when, in the same sermon, an
    equal or a longer time is spent on pardons than on this Word.
55. It must be the intention of the pope that if pardons, which are
    a very small thing, are celebrated with one bell, with single
    processions and ceremonies, then the Gospel, which is the very
    greatest thing, should be preached with a hundred bells, a hundred
    processions, a hundred ceremonies.
56. The "treasures of the Church," out of which the pope grants
    indulgences, are not sufficiently named or known among the people
    of Christ.
57. That they are not temporal treasures is certainly evident, for
    many of the vendors do not pour out such treasures so easily, but
    only gather them.
58. Nor are they the merits of Christ and the Saints, for even
    without the pope, these always work grace for the inner man, and
    the cross, death, and hell for the outward man.
59. St. Lawrence said that the treasures of the Church were the
    Church's poor, but he spoke according to the usage of the word in
    his own time.
60. Without rashness we say that the keys of the Church, given by
    Christ's merit, are that treasure;
61. For it is clear that for the remission of penalties and of
    reserved cases, the power of the pope is of itself sufficient.
62. The true treasure of the Church is the Most Holy Gospel of the
    glory and the grace of God.
63. But this treasure is naturally most odious, for it makes the
    first to be last.
64. On the other hand, the treasure of indulgences is naturally
    most acceptable, for it makes the last to be first.
65. Therefore the treasures of the Gospel are nets with which they
    formerly were wont to fish for men of riches.
66. The treasures of the indulgences are nets with which they now
    fish for the riches of men.
67. The indulgences which the preachers cry as the "greatest
    graces" are known to be truly such, in so far as they promote gain.
68. Yet they are in truth the very smallest graces compared with
    the grace of God and the piety of the Cross.
69. Bishops and curates are bound to admit the commissaries of
    apostolic pardons, with all reverence.
70. But still more are they bound to strain all their eyes and
    attend with all their ears, lest these men preach their own dreams
    instead of the commission of the pope.
71. He who speaks against the truth of apostolic pardons, let him
    be anathema and accursed!
72. But he who guards against the lust and license of the
    pardon-preachers, let him be blessed!
73. The pope justly thunders against those who, by any art,
    contrive the injury of the traffic in pardons.
74. But much more does he intend to thunder against those who use
    the pretext of pardons to contrive the injury of holy love and
    truth.
75. To think the papal pardons so great that they could absolve a
    man even if he had committed an impossible sin and violated the
    Mother of God -- this is madness.
76. We say, on the contrary, that the papal pardons are not able to
    remove the very least of venial sins, so far as its guilt is
    concerned.
77. It is said that even St. Peter, if he were now Pope, could not
    bestow greater graces; this is blasphemy against St. Peter and
    against the pope.
78. We say, on the contrary, that even the present pope, and any
    pope at all, has greater graces at his disposal; to wit, the
    Gospel, powers, gifts of healing, etc., as it is written in I.
    Corinthians xii.
79. To say that the cross, emblazoned with the papal arms, which is
    set up [by the preachers of indulgences], is of equal worth with
    the Cross of Christ, is blasphemy.
80. The bishops, curates and theologians who allow such talk to be
    spread among the people, will have an account to render.
81. This unbridled preaching of pardons makes it no easy matter,
    even for learned men, to rescue the reverence due to the pope from
    slander, or even from the shrewd questionings of the laity.
82. To wit: -- "Why does not the pope empty purgatory, for the sake
    of holy love and of the dire need of the souls that are there, if
    he redeems an infinite number of souls for the sake of miserable
    money with which to build a Church? The former reasons would be
    most just; the latter is most trivial."
83. Again: -- "Why are mortuary and anniversary masses for the dead
    continued, and why does he not return or permit the withdrawal of
    the endowments founded on their behalf, since it is wrong to pray
    for the redeemed?"
84. Again: -- "What is this new piety of God and the pope, that for
    money they allow a man who is impious and their enemy to buy out of
    purgatory the pious soul of a friend of God, and do not rather,
    because of that pious and beloved soul's own need, free it for pure
    love's sake?"
85. Again: -- "Why are the penitential canons long since in actual
    fact and through disuse abrogated and dead, now satisfied by the
    granting of indulgences, as though they were still alive and in
    force?"
86. Again: -- "Why does not the pope, whose wealth is to-day
    greater than the riches of the richest, build just this one church
    of St. Peter with his own money, rather than with the money of poor
    believers?"
87. Again: -- "What is it that the pope remits, and what
    participation does he grant to those who, by perfect contrition,
    have a right to full remission and participation?"
88. Again: -- "What greater blessing could come to the Church than
    if the pope were to do a hundred times a day what he now does once,
    and bestow on every believer these remissions and participations?"
89. "Since the pope, by his pardons, seeks the salvation of souls
    rather than money, why does he suspend the indulgences and pardons
    granted heretofore, since these have equal efficacy?"
90. To repress these arguments and scruples of the laity by force
    alone, and not to resolve them by giving reasons, is to expose the
    Church and the pope to the ridicule of their enemies, and to make
    Christians unhappy.
91. If, therefore, pardons were preached according to the spirit
    and mind of the pope, all these doubts would be readily resolved;
    nay, they would not exist.
92. Away, then, with all those prophets who say to the people of
    Christ, "Peace, peace," and there is no peace!
93. Blessed be all those prophets who say to the people of Christ,
    "Cross, cross," and there is no cross!
94. Christians are to be exhorted that they be diligent in
    following Christ, their Head, through penalties, deaths, and hell;
95. And thus be confident of entering into heaven rather through
    many tribulations, than through the assurance of peace.
