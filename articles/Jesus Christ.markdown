Jesus Christ is the originator and focus of the Christian faith based on the teaching of the Holy [Bible](Bible). He is the eternal second person of the Triune God who took on humanity at his incarnation, being born of the virgin Mary. He is uniquely the God-man, both fully God and fully man in his one person, who came to fully reveal God and accomplish the redemption of mankind through his sacrificial atoning death on the cross. On the third day following his crucifixion, Jesus rose from the dead by the power of the Holy Spirit and now sits at the right hand of God the Father, according to the Scriptures.

...

His incarnation, earthly ministry, death, and resurrection are specifically recorded in the four Gospels of the New Testament. The study of Jesus Christ is called Christology.

## Jesus the Christ
The name 'Jesus' is derived from the Latin form of the [Greek](Greek) _Iesous_, which in turn is the Greek translation of the [Hebrew](Hebrew) _Jeshua_, or _Joshua_, meaning "Jehovah is salvation." 

The title 'Christ', from the Greek _Christos_, is the equivalent of the Hebrew _Messias_, meaning "anointed one." Thus, the term Christ is a title rather than a proper name and identifies Jesus as the anticipated Messiah of the [Old Testament](Old Testament).

> "To believe that 'Jesus is the Christ' is to believe that he is the Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent of God, that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be. This is to believe the gospel, by the faith of which alone men can be brought unto God. That Jesus is the Christ is the testimony of God, and the faith of this constitutes a Christian (1 Corinthians 12:3; 1 John 5:1)."[^1]
