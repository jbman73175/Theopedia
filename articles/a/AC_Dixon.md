**Amzi Clarence Dixon** (1854 â€“ 1925) was a well-known Baptist
pastor, [Bible](Bible "Bible") expositor and evangelist, who
occupied a number of well known pulpits in the late 19th and early
20th centuries. Along with R.A. Torrey he edited what became the
influential journal
[The Fundamentals](The_Fundamentals "The Fundamentals") which
helped develop the teachings of what is known as fundamentalist
Christianity today.

Dixon was a stauch advocate of Fundamentalist Christianity during
that movement's developmental period. It was said that his
preaching was often polemical and direct, confronting various forms
of [apostasy](Apostasy "Apostasy"). Specifically, he preached
against a variety of apostasies including,
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism"), Henry
Ward Beecher's [liberalism](Liberalism "Liberalism"), Robert
Ingersoll's [agnosticism](Agnosticism "Agnosticism"),
[Christian Science](Christian_Science "Christian Science"),
[Unitarianism](Unitarianism "Unitarianism") and
[higher criticism](Higher_criticism "Higher criticism") of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible").
