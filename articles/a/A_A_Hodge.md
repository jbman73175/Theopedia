## Biographical overview

A. A. Hodge attended the College of New Jersey (later Princeton
University) and Princeton Theological Seminary, and, after spending
three years (1847-1850) in India as a missionary, held pastorates
at Lower West Nottingham, Maryland (1851-1855), Fredericksburg,
Virginia (1855-1861), and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania (1861-1864).
In 1864 he accepted a call to the chair of systematic theology in
the Western Theological Seminary (later Pittsburgh Theological
Seminary) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. There he remained until in
1877 he was called to Princeton to be the associate of his father
in the chair of systematic theology, to the full duties of which he
succeeded in 1878. This post he retained till his death.

At the time of his death, Hodge was in the zenith of his powers.
Every element that entered into his eminent reputation put on its
best expression during the closing years of his life. He was
public-spirited, and helped every good cause. He was a trustee of
the College of New Jersey and a leading man in the
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") Church. He was a man of
wide interests and touched the religious world at many points.
During the years immediately preceding his death he was writing,
preaching, lecturing, making addresses, coming into contact with
men, influencing them, and by doing so widening the influence of
the Christianity.

Hodge's distinguishing characteristic as a theologian was his power
as a thinker. He had a mind of singular acuteness, and though never
a professed student of metaphysics, he was essentially and by
nature a metaphysician. His theology was that of the
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") confessions. He had no peculiar
views and no peculiar method of organizing theological dogmas; and
though he taught the same theology that his father had taught
before him, he was independent as well as reverent.

His first book and that by which he is best known was his
*Outlines of Theology*, which was translated into Welsh, modern
Greek, and Hindustani. *The Atonement* is still one of the best
treatises on the subject. This was followed by his commentary on
the
[Westminster Confession of Faith](Westminster_Confession_of_Faith "Westminster Confession of Faith"),
a very useful book, full of clear thinking and compact statement.
He contributed some important articles to encyclopedias â€“
Johnson's, McClintock and Strong's, and the Schaff-Herzog
Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge. He was one of the founders of
the *Presbyterian Review*, to the pages of which he was a frequent
contributor.
