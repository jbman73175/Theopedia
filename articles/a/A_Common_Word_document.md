**A Common Word**, a shortened title for "A Common Word Between Us
and You," is a document written by 138 Muslim scholars, clerics and
intellectuals. Their goal was to come together to declare the
common ground between [Islam](Islam "Islam") and
[Christianity](Christianity "Christianity"). It was made public in
October, 2007, one year after "38 Islamic authorities and scholars
from around the world, representing all denominations and schools
of thought, joined together to deliver an answer to the Pope in the
spirit of open intellectual exchange and mutual understanding. In
their *Open Letter to the Pope* for the first time in recent
history, Muslim scholars from every branch of Islam spoke with one
voice about the true teachings of Islam." ^[[1]](#note-0)^
