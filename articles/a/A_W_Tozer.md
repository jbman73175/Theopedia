**A. W. Tozer** (1897-1963) was a pastor and author and was well
known in [evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") circles
both for his long and fruitful editorship of the *Alliance Witness*
as well as his pastorate of one of the largest Alliance churches in
the Chicago area.

"When he was 15 years old, Tozer's family moved to Akron, Ohio. One
afternoon as he walked home from his job at Goodyear, he overheard
a street [preacher](Preaching "Preaching") say, 'If you don't know
how to be saved . . . just call on [God](God "God").' When he got
home, he climbed the narrow stairs to the attic where, heeding the
preacher's advice, Tozer was launched into a lifelong pursuit of
God.

"In 1919, without formal education, Tozer was called to pastor a
small storefront church in Nutter Fort, West Virginia. That humble
beginning thrust him and his new wife Ada Cecelia Pfautz, into a
44-year ministry with The Christian and Missionary Alliance.
Thirty-one of those years were spent at Chicago's Southside
Alliance Church."
