**Abaddon**, a-bad'-on ('abhaddon, "ruin," "perdition,"
"destruction"): Though "destruction" is commonly used in
translating 'abhaddon', the stem idea is intransitive rather than
passive--the idea of perishing, going to ruin, being in a ruined
state, rather than that of being ruined, being destroyed.   
  
**OLD TESTAMENT USAGE**  
The word occurs six times in the Old Testament, always as a place
name in the sense in which Sheol is a place name. It denotes, in
certain aspects, the world of the dead as constructed in the Hebrew
imagination. It is a common mistake to understand such expressions
in a too mechanical way. Like ourselves, the men of the earlier
ages had to use picture language when they spoke of the conditions
that existed after death, however their picturing of the matter may
have differed from ours. In three instances Abaddon is parallel
with Sheol (Job 26:6; Pr 15:11; 27:20). In one instance it is
parallel with death, in one with the grave and in the remaining
instance the parallel phrase is "root out all mine increase" (Job
28:22; Ps 88:11; Job 31:12). In this last passage the place idea
comes nearer to vanishing in an abstract conception than in the
other passages. Abaddon belongs to the realm of the mysterious.
Only God understands it (Job 26:6; Pr 15:11). It is the world of
the dead in its utterly dismal, destructive, dreadful aspect, not
in those more cheerful aspects in which activities are conceived of
as in progress there. In Abaddon there are no declarations of God's
lovingkindness (Ps 88:11). In a slight degree the Old Testament
presentations personalize Abaddon. It is a synonym for
insatiableness (Pr 27:20). It has possibilities of information
mediate between those of "all living" and those of God (Job
28:22).  
  
**NEW TESTAMENT USAGE**  
In the New Testament the word occurs once (Re 9:11), the
personalization becoming sharp. Abaddon is here not the world of
the dead, but the angel who reigns over it. The Greek equivalent of
his name is given as Apollyon. Under this name Bunyan presents him
in the Pilgrim's Progress, and Christendom has doubtless been more
interested in this presentation of the matter than in any other. In
some treatments Abaddon is connected with the evil spirit Asmodeus
of Tobit (e.g. 3:8), and with the destroyer mentioned in The Wisdom
of Solomon (18:25; compare 22), and through these with a large body
of rabbinical folklore; but these efforts are simply groundless.
