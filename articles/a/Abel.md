In the Book of
[Bible character::Genesis](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Bible_character::Genesis&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bible character::Genesis (page does not exist)"),
**Abel** (Hebrew **Hével** / **Hável**) was the second son of
[Son of::Adam](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Son_of::Adam&action=edit&redlink=1 "Son of::Adam (page does not exist)").
He was slain by
[Sibling of::Cain](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Sibling_of::Cain&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sibling of::Cain (page does not exist)"),
his elder brother as recorded in Genesis 4:1-16. The narrative in
Genesis states that "the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his
offering, but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect."

## Hebrew roots

One proposed Hebrew etymology for the word "Abel" is: "AB", meaning
"source" in Hebrew, and "EL" meaning "God". Thus Abel is often
taken to mean "source of God" (breath), or "transitoriness"
(oneness with God). It more probably means *herdsman* (compare the
name "Jabal", Arabic *ibil* "camels"), and a distinction is drawn
between the pastoral Abel and the agriculturist Cain. If Cain is
the eponym of the Kenites it is quite possible that Abel was
originally a South Judaean demigod or hero; on this, see Winckler,
*Gesch. Israels,* ii. p. 189; E. Meyer, *Israeliten,* p. 395. A
sect of Abelitae, who seem to have lived in North Africa, is
mentioned by Augustine (*De Haeresibus,* lxxxvi.).

## Abel in the Bible

The [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") says that "by
faith Abel offered unto [God](God "God") a more excellent sacrifice
than Cain" (Hebrews 11:4), and that Cain slew Abel "because his own
works were evil and his brother's righteous" (1 John 3:12).

There are several references to Abel in the New Testament.

[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") speaks of him as "righteous" (Matthew
23:35). "The blood of sprinkling" is said to speak "better things
than that of Abel" (Hebrews 12:24); that is, the
[blood of Jesus](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Type_of::Jesus_Christ&action=edit&redlink=1 "Type of::Jesus Christ (page does not exist)")
is the reality of which the blood of the offering made by Abel was
only the type. The comparison is often seen as that between the
sacrifice offered by Christ and that offered by Abel, but some
believe it compares the blood of Christ calling for mercy and the
blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance. It is also said
(Hebrews 11:4) that "Abel offered unto God a more excellent
sacrifice than Cain." This sacrifice was made "by faith;" this
faith rested in God, not only as the Creator and the God of
providence, but especially in God as the great Redeemer, whose
sacrifice was typified by the sacrifices which, no doubt by the
divine institution, were offered from the days of Adam downward. On
account of that "faith" which looked forward to the great atoning
sacrifice, Abel's offering was accepted of God. Cain's offering had
no such reference, and therefore was rejected. Abel has been viewed
as the first human to die.
