**Abihu** was the second son of [Aaron](Aaron "Aaron") the Priest
and his wife
[Elisheba](index.php?title=Elisheba&action=edit&redlink=1 "Elisheba (page does not exist)"),
and the nephew of
[Nahshon](index.php?title=Nahshon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nahshon (page does not exist)"),
leader of the tribe of
[Judah](index.php?title=Judah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Judah (page does not exist)")
(Exodus 6:23; Numbers 2:3). Abihu went with the
[seventy elders of Israel](index.php?title=Seventy_elders_of_Israel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Seventy elders of Israel (page does not exist)")
when they went with Moses and saw the God of Israel (Exodus
24.9-11). Abihu served as a priest under his father. He is most
notable because he offered before God "strange fire" (incense that
was not according to the Law's specification) with his older
brother [Nadab](Nadab "Nadab") (Leviticus 10.1). When he offered
this incense God sent forth a fire that utterly consumed both Nadab
and Abihu. Aaron was commanded not to mourn at all for his sons,
who were justly executed for disobeying the commandment of God.

In Hebrew his name is אביהוא [*’Abiyhuw’* / ab·ee·**hoo**]. This is
a compound word meaning, "He is my father," or more literally, "My
father is he." It comes from the words אבי (my father) and הוא
(*Third Masculine Singular Pronoun*: he).
