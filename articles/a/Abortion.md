**Abortion** refers to any termination, natural or unnatural, of a
pregnancy which ends the life of a fetus. *Intentional abortion*
refers to any intervention, by any person including the mother,
that willfully terminates a pregnancy, thus ending the life of the
baby. *On demand* refers to the situation where abortion may be
obtained by request or consent of the mother for a broad range of
social, economic or personal reasons that do not include immediate
threat to the life or health of either mother or child. An abortion
is
"[late-term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/late-term_abortion "w:late-term abortion")"
if it is performed after the twentieth week of pregnancy.

Intentional abortion has been a major moral, ethical, and social
issue since the first centuries of the early
[church](Church "Church"). However, the trend in the last century
to legalize abortion on demand, particularly in the northern
hemisphere, e.g., the USSR (1920), UK (1967), US (1973), and Canada
(1988), has brought the debate to the forefront for many
Christians. The
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism") church has
been, from the beginning, unwavering in its opposition to abortion,
and the majority of North American
[Evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") churches now stand
with them against it.

## Biblical background

Although the Bible never specifically states "thou shalt not have
an abortion" or "a fetus is a person," the general tenor of
Scripture is resoundingly pro-life. Based on the clear prohibition
on the taking of innocent life, or the shedding of innocent blood
(Genesis 9:6; Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 19:10,13; 21:8,9; 27:25;
others below), the biblical case against abortion is made by
demonstrating the continuity of personal identity between the fetus
and the child. The primary question confronting the Christian is
whether the Bible addresses the issue of when life begins, and
specifically whether God consider an unborn child a person.

It is not sufficient to build an argument against abortion by
proving that God is deeply involved in the creation of a fetus in
the womb. While passages such as these (Job 31:15; Psalm 22:9-10;
139:13-16; Isaiah 44:2,24) clearly show that God cares deeply about
the unborn, the same thing could be said regarding any of God's
creatures. It is incumbent on the pro-life advocate to demonstrate
that God attributes the same characteristics to the unborn in the
womb as to a person out of the womb.

Both science and the Bible demonstrate that personal identity
begins before a child is brought to full term and given birth. Some
of the facts regarding the development of a fetus^[[1]](#note-0)^:

-   at the moment of conception - a genetically distinct person
    possessing 46 chromosomes
-   by week 4 - the heart beats at a regular rhythm
-   by week 5 - the brain develops into five areas and some cranial
    nerves are visible
-   by week 6 - arms and legs have developed, hands and feet have
    digits
-   by week 7 - all essential organs have at least begun to form
-   by the end of the first trimester - external facial features
    begin to take their final shape
-   by 12 or 13 weeks - baby sucks thumb, recoils from pain, and
    has own unique fingerprints

There is no distinction in the language of the Bible (Hebrew or
Greek) between an embryo, a fetus, and a child. Consequently, texts
that refer to embryos or fetuses use the word "child" to describe
both. In Genesis 25:21-22, Rebekah conceived twins, and "the
children struggled together within her," consistent with the
biblical pattern of referring to the unborn as children (cf. 2
Kings 19:3; Ruth 1:11). Babies that die before birth are referred
to as infants, such as in Job 3:16 where he asks, "Or why was I not
as a hidden stillborn child, as infants who never see the light?"
(cf. Psalm 8:2 and Hosea 13:16).

The continuity between conception and birth is established in
Genesis 4:1, which states that Eve "conceived and bore Cain,
saying, 'I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD.'" The
person who was conceived was considered the same person who was
born. This continuity is perhaps clearest in Job 3:3, which states
"Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said,
'A man is conceived.'" This passage employs synonymous parallelism
and uses the terms "born" and "conceived" interchangeably,
suggesting that what was present at birth is considered equivelent
to what was present at conception. This is strengthened by the use
of the Hebrew term for "boy", *geber*, used elsewhere to refer to a
man (cf. Exodus 10:11; Deuteronomy 22:5; Judges 5:30).

Other passages describe God's relationship to the unborn in the
same way as to a child or an adult. People have potential to be
both enemies of God (Psalm 51:5; 58:3) and chosen by God (Romans
9:10-13) from the womb. God called and set apart many of His
servants from the womb:

-   Samson (Judges 13:6-7)
-   Jeremiah (1:5)
-   John the Baptist (Luke 1:15)
-   Paul (Galatians 1:15)

Some supporters of legalized abortion object to the use of these
texts, suggesting that "in the womb" is merely a figure of speech
for indicating God's foreknowledge and sovereignty.

Many proponents of preserving access to intentional abortion on
demand cite the following passage in Exodus 21:22-25

> "When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her
> children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall
> surely be fined, as the woman's husband shall impose on him, and he
> shall pay as the judges determine. But if there is harm, then you
> shall pay life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for
> hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for
> stripe."

While at first glance the penalty for terminating the pregnancy
seems considerably less than the penalty for murder, opponents of
abortion argue that this passage does not directly address the
ethics of intentional abortion because:

-   it is concerned with *accidental* miscarriage, with no consent
    from the mother
-   it does not assume the death of the fetus as a result of the
    miscarriage

What this text does address is the standard of
[lex talionis](http://wsu.edu/~dee/GLOSSARY/LEXTAL.HTM) or
*law of retribution* in the "life for life" phrase, positioned to
imply that the lost child had life that in retribution demands life
from the offender. The Hebrew word used here (and elsewhere in the
OT) to refer to the unborn is *yeled*, a word that "generally
indicates young children, but may refer to teens or even young
adults"^[[2]](#note-1)^.

One Jewish interpretation of this text that some ethicists have
drawn from is that it does allow for a reproductive ethic which
includes the option of abortion^[[3]](#note-2)^.

### Issues to consider

-   Human life is unique and made in God's own image (Genesis 1:26)
-   Shedding innocent blood is always condemned (cited above, plus
    1 Samuel 19:5; 2Kings 21:16; 24:4; Psalm 106:38; Proverbs 6:17;
    Isaiah 59:7; Jeremiah 7:6; 22:3,17; 26:15; Joel 3:19; Jonah 1:14;
    Matthew 23:35; 27:4)
-   Jesus warned against viewing children as an inconvenience (Luke
    18:15-17)
-   God has a purpose for everything, including our own suffering
    (Romans 8:28)
    -   Sometimes we suffer for our own sin (Hebrews 12:3-11)
    -   Sometimes we suffer for someone else's sin (Genesis 50:20)
    -   Sometimes we suffer to display God's grace and power (2
        Corinthians 12:7-10)


## Historical background

### Early Christian

Abortion was an issue for the very earliest Christians. The Romans
taught abortion at their
[medical schools](http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/special/Stephanie_Doerfler/Abortion.html)
and practiced it, together with contraception and infanticide, as a
method of family planning.

The early Christians, at that time persecuted by the Romans,
rejected these practices.

-   The Didache, a guide to living a faithful lifestyle written
    around 100 AD, states "thou shalt not murder a child by abortion
    nor kill them when born"
    [(Did. 2:2)](http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/noncanon/fathers/ante-nic/didache.htm).
-   Athenagoras, a second-century Christian brought before the
    Roman Emperor to answer charges of murderous behaviour among
    Christians, answered: "How can we kill a man when we are those who
    say that all who use abortifacients are homicides and will account
    to God for their abortions as for the killing of men? For the fetus
    in the womb is not an animal, and it is God's providence that he
    exists."^[[4]](#note-3)^

### The Church Fathers

Church fathers such as Tertullian,
[Thomas Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas"), and
[Augustine](Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo") took clear
stands against abortion. For example:

-   Augustine described how appalled he was at the pagan use of
    abortion for birth control as follows: "sometimes this lustful
    cruelty or cruel lust comes to this that they even procure poisons
    of sterility, and if these do not work, they extinguish and destroy
    the fetus in some way in the womb." ^[[5]](#note-4)^
-   Basil of Cappadocia described abortion as equivalent to murder
    irrespective of any distinction between the "formed" and the
    "unformed" fetus ^[[6]](#note-5)^

### The Reformers

[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"), in 1563, called abortion
"atrocious" because "the foetus, though enclosed in the womb of its
mother, is already a human being, and it is almost a monstrous
crime to rob it of the life which it has not yet begun to enjoy. If
it seems more horrible to kill a man in his own house than in a
field, because a man's house is his place of most secure refuge, it
ought surely to be deemed more atrocious to destroy a foetus in the
womb before it has come to light." ^[[7]](#note-6)^

## Legal background (US)

According to figures reported by the government’s Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) and the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI),
Planned Parenthood’s special research affiliate, it is estimated
that nearly 50 million abortions have been performed in the US
since the landmark case that initially legalized abortion in the
US.[[3]](http://www.nrlc.org/factsheets/FS03_AbortionInTheUS.pdf)
Although there have been numerous legal battles over the years,
several specific cases that have reached the Supreme Court have
been particularly important, both in establishing the right of a
woman to have an abortion, and in limiting that right.

### Roe v. Wade (1973)

In perhaps its most controversial case ever, a US Supreme Court
decision established that most laws against abortion violate an
unstated constitutional right to privacy^[[8]](#note-7)^,
effectively legalizing abortion on demand throughout the full nine
months of pregnancy.

In his dissenting opinion, Justice Byron White wrote, "I find
nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support
the Court's judgment. The Court simply fashions and announces a new
constitutional right for pregnant mothers and, with scarcely any
reason or authority for its action, invests that right with
sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion
statutes." He continued, "The Court apparently values the
convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued
existence and development of the life or potential life that she
carries." ^[[9]](#note-8)^  
The plaintiff in the case,
[Norma McCorvey](Norma_McCorvey "Norma McCorvey") (pseudonymously
referred to as Jane Roe), challenged an 1857 Texas law prohibiting
abortions and the Court ruled in her favor. Norma later converted
to Christianity and renounced her pro-choice position. She
currently ministers to women through
[Crossing Over Ministry](http://www.roenomore.org/), formerly Roe
No More, and has recently sought to have the Roe v. Wade decision
overturned.

### Doe v. Bolton (1973)

This companion case was decided on the same day as *Roe v. Wade*,
expanding what was meant by the life and health of the mother,
interpretting the exception clause to include her psychological and
emotional health, and thus making abortion on demand available
throughout a woman's pregnancy.

### Planned Parenthood v. Danforth (1977)

This case paved the way for wives to obtain abortions without
consulting their husbands and for teenagers to obtain abortions
without their parents' knowledge. The court ruled that a woman's
right to an abortion cannot be limited by the requirement that a
spouse or parent of a minor child must grant prior consent, and
that the decision to abort must be left to the pregnant woman and
the best medical judgment of her attending physician.

### Webster v. Reproductive Health Services (1989)

This case marked one of the first significant limits abortion
rights, upholding a Missouri law that prohibited the use of public
funds or medical facilities for abortions not necessary to
safeguard the life of the mother. The court ruled that the right to
be free from interference in pursuing an abortion does not obligate
the state to provide a way for a woman to obtain the abortion.

### Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992)

In what was considered by many abortion opponents to be the best
opportunity to overturn *Roe v. Wade*, this case considered the
provisions of a Pennsylvania law that required a 24-hour waiting
period (during which a woman must be informed of the procedure, the
risks, and the probable gestational age of the fetus), parental
consent for a minor (with a judicial bypass provision), and
notification of the husband. A "medical emergency" exempted a woman
from all of these requirements. The court upheld two of the three
provisions, but declared the spousal notification provision
invalid, citing potential risk and the significant obstacle it
could pose for some women in obtaining an abortion.

## Current perspectives

### Mainline churches

The [Episcopal Church](Episcopalian "Episcopalian"), the
[Presbyterian Church (USA)](Presbyterian_Church_(USA) "Presbyterian Church (USA)"),
the
[United Methodist Church](United_Methodist_Church "United Methodist Church"),
and the
[United Church of Christ](index.php?title=United_Church_of_Christ&action=edit&redlink=1 "United Church of Christ (page does not exist)")
have, in recent years, been increasingly active in advocating for
the legality of abortion, and clergy from all of these
denominations are active in the Religious Coalition for
Reproductive Choice.^[[10]](#note-9)^

The
[Evangelical Lutheran Church](index.php?title=Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America&action=edit&redlink=1 "Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (page does not exist)")
(ELCA) is comprised of three recently united (1988) denominations
that held a variety of views on abortion at the time of the merger.
Although the ELCA is ostensibly opposed to abortion except in cases
of grave necessity, the denomination's clergy and theologians
continue to hold a variety of perspectives. ELCA medical coverage
continues to cover elective abortion for pastors and church staff.

The
[United Church of Canada](index.php?title=United_Church_of_Canada&action=edit&redlink=1 "United Church of Canada (page does not exist)")
promotes unrestricted access to abortion, urging that "the
Government of Canada not to use provisions in the criminal code to
regulate abortion."^[[11]](#note-10)^

The most recent statement from the
[Anglican Church of Canada](Anglican_Church_of_Canada "Anglican Church of Canada")
is a 1989 press release ^[[12]](#note-11)^ that includes the
following statement: "abortion is always the taking of a human life
and, in our view, should never be done except for serious
therapeutic reasons." As recently as 2006 this statement was still
offered on an official church website, but it has since been
removed. The same press release refers to abortions as a negotiable
right: "We think it right to try to establish a balance between the
legitimate rights of women and the state's interest in the foetus,"
and re-asserts acceptance of abortion under some circumstances,
"The Anglican Church, in its resolutions, accepts abortion as a
therapeutic measure where pregnancy endangers a woman's life or
physical or mental health."

Other [mainline](Mainline_church "Mainline church") denominations
such as the
[American Baptist Churches](index.php?title=American_Baptist_Churches_in_the_USA&action=edit&redlink=1 "American Baptist Churches in the USA (page does not exist)")
are more varied in their perspectives, and have chosen not to
address the issue of abortion directly because of the diversity of
views within their constituent churches and prefer to leave the
decision to the individual's conscience.

The [Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England")
([Anglican](Anglicanism "Anglicanism")) summarizes its position as
follows: "The Church of England combines strong opposition to
abortion with a recognition that there can be strictly limited
conditions under which it may be morally preferable to any
available alternative." More strongly, they assert:

> "In the light of our conviction that the foetus has the right to
> live and develop as a member of the human family, we see abortion,
> the termination of that life by the act of man, as a great moral
> evil. We do not believe that the right to life, as a right
> pertaining to persons, admits of no exceptions whatever; but the
> right of the innocent to life admits surely of few exceptions
> indeed."^[[13]](#note-12)^

In a
[2001 poll](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/poll010702.html%7C),
66% of non-evangelical protestants in the USA said "abortion should
be generally legal"

### Evangelical churches

[Evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical") denominations are almost
uniformly opposed to legalized abortion.

The
[National Association of Evangelicals](National_Association_of_Evangelicals "National Association of Evangelicals"),
representing a very broad group of American Evangelical churches,
takes the following stand on Abortion:

> "The core of the issue relates to the life of unborn children and
> if a woman has the right to terminate her pregnancy. We believe the
> moral issue of abortion is more than a question of the freedom of a
> woman to control the reproductive functions of her body. It is
> rather a question of those circumstances under which a human being
> may be permitted to take the life of another. We believe that all
> life is a gift of God, so that neither the life of the unborn child
> nor the mother may be lightly taken. We believe that God, Himself,
> in Scripture, has conferred divine blessing upon unborn infants and
> has provided penalties for actions which result in the death of the
> unborn." ^[[14]](#note-13)^

The
[Evangelical Association of Canada](index.php?title=Evangelical_Association_of_Canada&action=edit&redlink=1 "Evangelical Association of Canada (page does not exist)"),
which represents a similarly broad group of Canadian Evangelical
churches, takes a similar stand:

> "The Bible teaches that God gives life as a gift. Human life has
> inherent worth and must be respected and protected through all of
> its stages, beginning at conception... Today, abortion access in
> Canada is among the freest in the world, offering no real
> protection for the unborn. It is time for a culture of life in
> Canada in which the rights of the unborn are protected, and the
> inherent worth of each human life recognized, regardless of their
> age, ability or condition, or the circumstances surrounding their
> conception." ^[[15]](#note-14)^

Individuals within these traditions, though less unanimous, have
reached the same general consensus. In a
[2001 poll](http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/poll010702.html%7C),
63% of protestant evangelicals in the USA said "abortion should be
illegal in all or most cases."

### Roman Catholic

The Roman Catholic stand against abortion has not changed
substantially over two millenia:

> "From the moment of its conception life must be guarded with the
> greatest care, while abortion and infanticide are unspeakable
> crimes... that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, always
> constitutes a grave moral disorder, since it is the deliberate
> killing of an innocent human being. This doctrine is based upon the
> natural law and upon the written Word of God, is transmitted by the
> Church's Tradition and taught by the ordinary and universal
> Magisterium." ^[[16]](#note-15)^
