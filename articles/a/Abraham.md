nations.

The account of his life is found in the Book of
[Bible character::Genesis](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Bible_character::Genesis&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bible character::Genesis (page does not exist)"),
beginning in Chapter 11 at the close of a genealogy of the sons of
[Shem](index.php?title=Shem&action=edit&redlink=1 "Shem (page does not exist)")
(which includes among its members
[Eber](index.php?title=Eber&action=edit&redlink=1 "Eber (page does not exist)"),
possibly the
[eponym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eponym "w:eponym") for the
name *[Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew")*).

Abraham stands out prominently as a recipient of the promises of
God, delivered in the form of a
[covenant](Abrahamic_Covenant "Abrahamic Covenant") (Gen. 12:2-7,
13:14-17, 15, 17, 18:17-19, 22:17-18, 24:7). In the
[Bible character::New Testament](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Bible_character::New_Testament&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bible character::New Testament (page does not exist)")
Abraham is mentioned prominently as a man of faith (Hebrews 11),
and the apostle Paul uses him as an example of
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") by faith (in Galatians 3).

Authors of the New Testament cite Abraham to support belief in the
[resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection") of the dead. "But
concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book
of [Moses](Moses "Moses"), in the burning bush passage, how God
spoke to him, saying, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob?" He is not the God of the dead, but the God
of the living. You are therefore greatly mistaken." (Mark 12:26-27)
"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who
had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom
it was said, 'In Isaac your seed shall be called,' concluding that
God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he
also received him in a figurative sense," (Hebrews 11:17-19).

The chief promise made to Abraham in Genesis 12 is that through his
seed, all the people of earth would be blessed. This promise was
fulfilled through Abraham's seed, Jesus Christ.

Christian tradition sees Abraham as a figure of God, and Abraham's
offering up of
[Isaac](index.php?title=Isaac&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isaac (page does not exist)")
is a foreshadowing of [God](God "God")'s offering of his Son,
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") (Gen. 22:1-14; Heb. 11:17-19). Just as Isaac
carried wood for the sacrifice up the mountain and willingly
submitted to being offered, so Jesus carried his Cross up the hill
and allowed himself to be crucified.
