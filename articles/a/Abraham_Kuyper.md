**Abraham Kuyper** (1837-1920) was born in the town of Maassluis
and was a Dutch [Calvinist](Calvinist "Calvinist") theologian,
scholar, and statesman. He was a professor of
[theology](Theology "Theology") and also a major force behind the
start of the Vrije Universiteit (Free University) in Amsterdam. He
was the founder of two newspapers, *De Standaard* (*The Standard*)
and *De Heraut* (*The Herald*). He served as editor for
*De Standaard* and wrote often for *De Heraut*. He was also the
founder of the Anti-Revolutionaire Partij (Anti-Revolutionary
Party) and served as prime minister of the Netherlands for four
years (1901-1905).

At the invitation of
[B. B. Warfield](B._B._Warfield "B. B. Warfield"), Kuyper delivered
the Stone Lectures at Princeton Seminary in 1898, which was his
first widespread exposure to a North American audience. During his
time in the United States, he also traveled to address Dutch
reformed congregations in several states.

He is considered the father of Dutch Neo-Calvinism and had
considerable influence on the thought of
[Herman Dooyeweerd](Herman_Dooyeweerd "Herman Dooyeweerd"). Others
that have been influenced by Kuyper include:
[Francis Schaeffer](Francis_Schaeffer "Francis Schaeffer"),
[Cornelius Van Til](Cornelius_Van_Til "Cornelius Van Til"), and
[Alvin Plantinga](Alvin_Plantinga "Alvin Plantinga").
