The expression **[Abraham](Abraham "Abraham")'s Bosom** occurs in
the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:22-23). It gives
reference to the place where
[Lazarus](index.php?title=Lazarus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lazarus (page does not exist)")
was carried after his death.

"The phrase "to be in one's bosom" applies to the person who so
reclines at the table that his head is brought almost into the
bosom of the one sitting next above him. To be in Abraham's bosom
signified to occupy the seat next to Abraham. Jesus, accommodating
His speech to the Jews, describes the condition of Lazarus after
death by this figure (Luke 16:22-23)." ^[[1]](#note-0)^
Abraham's Bosom is not spoken of as in [Hades](Hades "Hades") but
rather as something separate from it (Luke 16:23). Thus, it should
be understood as a place of happiness and rest. In parallel,
Matthew 8:11 gives reference to those who will "sit down with
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven." Some have
also considered this to be the equivalent of the
[Paradise](index.php?title=Paradise&action=edit&redlink=1 "Paradise (page does not exist)")
of Luke 23:43.
