**Accountability** is the concept of expecting and being prepared
to give an account for one's actions. Synonyms that are helpful in
explaining accountability include: answerability, responsibility,
transparency and liability. Christians recognize first their
accountability to [God](God "God"), but to a lesser degree, to each
other.

Relationships of accountability include the activities of
exhortation, confession, [prayer](Prayer "Prayer"), encouragement
and fellowship.

accountability:

-   Galatians 6:1
