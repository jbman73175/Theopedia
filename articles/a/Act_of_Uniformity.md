The **Act of Uniformity** (1662) enacted the rites and ceremonies
of the *Book of Common Prayer* as requirements for

episcopal ordination of clergy, resulting in the
[Great Ejection](index.php?title=Great_Ejection&action=edit&redlink=1 "Great Ejection (page does not exist)")
of 2,000 dissenting clergy.
