**Adam**, mentioned first in the Book of
[Bible character::Genesis](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Bible_character::Genesis&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bible character::Genesis (page does not exist)"),
was the first man to ever live. His name, in Hebrew, is אדם
(pronounced: ah-dahm) which has a basic meaning of "mankind," a
related noun is אדמה (pronounced: ah-dah-mah) which means "earth"
or "soil."

Adam dwelled in the
[Garden of Eden](Garden_of_Eden "Garden of Eden") until he followed
the lead of his wife
[Husband of::Eve](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Husband_of::Eve&action=edit&redlink=1 "Husband of::Eve (page does not exist)")
and ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (Genesis 3:6).
After this, he attempted to deceive [God](God "God") and blamed his
actions on Eve and, indirectly, on God Himself (Genesis 3:12). The
Bible then records:

"Then the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us
in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take
also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever--" therefore the
LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground
from which he was taken. He drove out the man, and at the east of
the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that
turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life."--Genesis
3:22-24.
  
Adam was father to

[Father of::Seth](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Father_of::Seth&action=edit&redlink=1 "Father of::Seth (page does not exist)")
(Genesis 4:25), and other children (Genesis 5:4). He lived to be
[Age::930](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Age::930&action=edit&redlink=1 "Age::930 (page does not exist)")
years old.
