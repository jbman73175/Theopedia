**Adam Clarke** (1762 - 1832) was a British
[Methodist](Methodism "Methodism") theologian, preacher, and
commentator. He is chiefly remembered for writing a commentary on
the [Bible](Bible "Bible") (8 vols., Liverpool, 1810-26), which
long had an extensive circulation. He also published a
*Biographical Dictionary* (6 vols., London, 1802) and its
supplement, *The Biographical Miscellany* (2 vols., 1806). His
Miscellaneous Works were edited in thirteen volumes by J. Everett
(London, 1836-37).

As a theologian, Clarke taught that the Bible provides a complete
interpretation of God's will and nature. He considered Scripture
itself a miracle of God's grace, "...which takes away the veil of
darkness and ignorance."^[1](#fn_1)^ With such an understanding,
Clarke was first and foremost a *Biblical* theologian, often uneasy
with purely systematic approaches to theology.

Clarke generally followed Wesley regarding the interpretation of
God's forgiving [grace](Grace "Grace"),
[prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace"),
the offer of [justification](Justification "Justification") from
God to all persons,
[sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification"), and
[assurance](Assurance_of_salvation "Assurance of salvation").

Perhaps his most controversial position regarded the
*[eternal Sonship of Jesus Christ](Eternal_sonship_of_Christ "Eternal sonship of Christ")*.
Clarke did not believe it Biblically faithful to affirm this
doctrine, maintaining that prior to the Incarnation, Jesus was
"unoriginated". Otherwise, according to Clarke, Christ would be
subordinate to God and therefore not fully divine. This was
important to Clarke because he felt that Christ's divinity was
crucial to understand the [atonement](Atonement "Atonement").

Clarke's view was opposed by many Methodists, notably
[Richard Watson](Richard_Watson "Richard Watson"). Watson and his
allies argued that Clarke's position jeopardized the integrity of
the doctrine of the Trinity. Clarke's view was rejected by
Methodism in favor of the traditional orthodox perspective of
[Christology](Christology "Christology").

His chief contribution remains his *Commentary on the Bible*, which
was an academic tour de force in its day and is still widely used.
