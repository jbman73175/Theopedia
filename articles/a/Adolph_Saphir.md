**Adolph Saphir** (1831 - 1891) was a Hungarian Christian who was
born into a Jewish family. He and his family were converted in 1843
when the Scottish Free Church sent missionaries to the Jews in
Hungary. After completing his studies in 1854, Saphir served in the
Irish Presbyterian Church as a missionary to the Jews. He was later
ordained by the Presbytery of Belfast. He was a pastor of churches
in Glasgow and in London from 1861-1888. Saphir's book,
*The Hidden Life* was described as "one of the most helpful books
in English literature on the subject of prayer and the deeper
Christian life." ^[[1]](#note-0)^
