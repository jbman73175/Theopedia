One of the names for God is **Adonai**, which is Hebrew for "Lord"
(Hebrew: אֲדֹנָי). Formally, this is a plural ("Lords"), but the
plural is usually construed as a respectful, and not a syntactic
plural. The singular form is *Adoni* ("lord"). This was used by the
Phoenicians for the pagan god Tammuz and is the origin of the Greek
name *Adonis*. Jews only use the singular to refer to a
distinguished person.

Some suggest that "Adonai" and other names of God may be written in
the plural form to point out that this one God embodies all of the
many gods that were worshipped by the ancestors of the Israelites
and concurrently by the surrounding peoples.

Since pronouncing God's personal name [YHWH](Yahweh "Yahweh") is
considered sinful by the Jews, they use *Adonai* instead in prayers
and the reading of the Scriptures. When the Masoretes added vowel
pointings to the text of the Hebrew Bible in the first century
A.D., they gave the word YHWH the vowels of *Adonai*, to remind the
reader to say *Adonai* instead.
