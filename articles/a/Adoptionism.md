**Adoptionism** is a [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") which maintains that
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") was a human being who became divine by
adoption. Some taught that this ocurred at his
[baptism](Baptism_of_Jesus "Baptism of Jesus"), while other
believed he became God at his
[resurrection](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus"). The
earliest work that expresses this view in general is the
[Shepherd of Hermas](Shepherd_of_Hermas "Shepherd of Hermas") (c.
150 AD). Adherents of this view were declared heretics in the third
century.
