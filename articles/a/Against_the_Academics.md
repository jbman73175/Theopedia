**Against the Academics** (Contra academicos, 386) was
[Augustine of Hippo](Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo")'s
first writing after his conversion to Christianity. It is a polemic
against the value of academic skepticism as found in Cicero's
philosophical dialogue *Academica*. A similar refutation to
skepticism can be found in his more mature *On the Trinity* (De
trinitate, 400-416). Academic skepticism was the product of two
centuries of debate within Greek Hellenistic thought, ending just
after the time of Cicero (died 43 BC).
