"[I]n the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") the main
word for God's love is **agape**, which many of you are probably
familiar with. Agape is an in-spite-of love rather than a
because-of love. God loves us not because we are smart or cute or
strong or rich. He loves us in spite of the fact that we have
nothing about us that commends us to Him." -
[Bruce Ware](Bruce_Ware "Bruce Ware")

Agape (greek, αγαπη) primarily refers to an ideal love that is not
romantically based. However, it is occasionally used instead of
[phileo](index.php?title=Phileo&action=edit&redlink=1 "Phileo (page does not exist)")
to mean romantic love.

In passages such as [2 Peter 1](2_Peter_1 "2 Peter 1"):7, *agape*
refers to a love towards people in general and is opposed to
*philadelpheo* ("brotherly love"), which refers to love to other
members of the body of Christ.
