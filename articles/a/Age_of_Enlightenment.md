The **Enlightenment** generally refers to the 18th century
intellectual and philosophical developments in Europe. This
movement advocated rationality as the sole criteria for
establishing an authoritative system of ethics, aesthetics, and
knowledge. The intellectual leaders of this movement regarded
themselves as courageous and elite, and viewed their purpose as
leading the world towards progress and out of a long period of
doubtful tradition, full of irrationality, superstition, and
tyranny (which they saw resulting from the "Dark Ages").

## Epistemology

During the Enlightenment, people came to assume that through a
judicious use of reason, an unending progress would be possible —
progress in knowledge, in technical achievement, and even in moral
values. Following the philosophy of Locke, the 18th-century writers
believed that knowledge is not innate, but comes only from
experience and observation guided by reason. Through proper
education, humanity itself could be altered, its nature changed for
the better.^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Theology

Although they saw the church — especially the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
— as the principal force that had enslaved the human mind in the
past, most Enlightenment thinkers did not renounce religion
altogether. They opted rather for a form of [Deism](Deism "Deism"),
accepting the existence of God and of a hereafter, but rejecting
the intricacies of Christian [theology](Theology "Theology"). Human
aspirations, they believed, should not be centered on the next
life, but rather on the means of improving this life. Worldly
happiness was placed before religious salvation. Nothing was
attacked with more intensity and ferocity than the church, with all
its wealth, political power, and suppression of the free exercise
of reason.^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Terminology

Bernard Ramm writes that "the approved concepts were reason,
freedom, nature, utility, happiness, rights, tolerance,
[deism](Deism "Deism"), rational Christianity, natural religion,
social contract, science, autonomy, harmony, and optimism. The
disapproved concepts were authority, antiquity, tradition, church,
revelation, the supernatural, and theological explanations."

## Result of Enlightenment thinking

The Enlightenment produced a revolution in the way humans thought
about God, the Bible, and themselves. Since theology deals with
something no one can weigh, measure, experiment upon, test, or
prove, it must be thrown back into the inner self. Subjective
experience becomes the source of "God thought." As one writer put
it, "Man, in the condition of his soul, not God in his work becomes
the center." Christian doctrine makes no statement about God; it
only speaks of man's feelings about God.^[[4]](#note-3)^

## Notable figures

The more notable figures in the Enlightenment were French thinkers
known as philosophes:

-   Voltaire, pen-name for François-Marie Arouet, the preeminent
    member of this group was a writer, historian, and poet. He emerged
    as the Enlightenment's chief critic of contemporary culture and
    religion.
-   Jean Jacques Rousseau, whose writings greatly influenced the
    political thinking of the time.
-   Charles, Baron de Montesquieu challenged the idea of rule by a
    monarch and championed individual freedom.
-   The philosopher Denis Diderot, in collaboration with Jean
    D'Alembert, founded the multivolume *Encyclopédie* designed to
    include all realms of knowledge. Many of the entries were written
    by other philosophes.

In German-speaking countries:

-   Philosophers Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and Moses Mendelssohn
    championed the ideas of the Enlightenment.
-   Immanuel Kant, Philosopher and physicist, wrote on ethics and
    morals and prescribed a politics of Enlightenment.
-   Johann Gottfried von Herder, Theologian and Linguist, proposed
    that language determines thought.

Several monarchs during this period, including Frederick the Great
of Prussia, Catherine the Great of Russia, and Joseph II of
Austria, were known as enlightened despots because they supported
many ideas of the Enlightenment.

Notable Enlightenment figures in Britain included:

-   Adam Smith, philosopher and economist
-   David Hume, philosopher and historian
-   Jeremy Bentham, philosopher

Enlightenment figures in North America included Thomas Jefferson,
Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Paine, all [Deists](Deism "Deism").
