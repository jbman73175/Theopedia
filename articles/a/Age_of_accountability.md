The **Age of Accountability** is that time in the development of a
person when he or she can and invariably does sin against God and
thus stands in the need of personal
[redemption](Redemption "Redemption") through
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ").^[[1]](#note-Holman)^

It is a controversial theological notion held by many Christians
that for the purpose of [salvation](Salvation "Salvation"), a
person is covered by God's grace until mature enough to understand
and thus be responsible for obedience to God's moral law. It is one
of the things that must be of great concern to Christian parents
who love their children.^[[2]](#note-0)^

Proponents understand it to be the non-depraved status (innocence)
of infants, preadolescent children, and persons who are incapable
of recognizing or assuming personal responsibility due to
developmental, mental or emotional disability. Essentially, anyone
who has not reached a sufficient level of abstract reasoning is
considered covered by this grace.
[John MacArthur](John_MacArthur "John MacArthur") concludes that up
until a point of real saving faith in a child's life, God in His
mercy would save that child if that child should
die.^[[3]](#note-1)^

Some opponents believe that
[infant baptism](Infant_baptism "Infant baptism") provides
salvation to those unable to choose.

## Traditional concept

The concept is not directly mentioned in the Bible but stems from
individual church traditions. However, the Bible teaches personal
responsibility for sin and the nature of salvation. This raises
questions about *when* a person becomes capable of understanding
sin and the nature of salvation, thus becoming answerable or
accountable to God for sin.

## Non-chronological

It is not tied to specific chronological age since rates and ages
of development naturally vary from person to person. It is affected
by a variety of social and environmental factors including
television and movies, video games, influence of parents, teachers,
and life experiences.^[[4]](#note-Miller)^

## Arguments from Scripture

Proponents hold that infants, pre-adolescent children, and certain
disabled children cannot be spiritually depraved. Similarly, the
Bible indicates that salvation is an intentional act of faith on
the part of individuals. To exercise this choice, persons must be
aware they are sinners before God and be able to repent of that
rebellious lifestyle. Evangelical Christians and others believe
that persons must be capable of transferring trust for their
salvation to Jesus as personal Savior and Lord. They must be able
to understand that their lifestyles should be patterned after the
example of Christ (Romans 10:9-14). Those who advocate the doctrine
of an age of accountability believe that since an infant or young
child cannot make such distinctions, they are not held responsible
for personal since until they are capable of making such a
decision.^[[1]](#note-Holman)^

Proponents further point to the prophet Ezekiel who, after
contrasting the behavior of a father with his son, stated: “The
soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the guilt of the
father, nor the father bear the guilt of the son” (Ezek. 18:20; cf.
vss. 2-19).^[[4]](#note-Miller)^

Under the Old Testament, the Jews recognized that children could
not be held personally accountable to the law of Moses. They set
the arbitrary age of twelve as the year when a child assumed adult
status in religious matters.^[[1]](#note-Holman)^

Jesus, Himself, is understood by many to have demonstrated the
spiritually safe condition of children when He stated: “Assuredly,
I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little
children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven”
(Matthew 18:3). Jesus followed up this declaration with a
comparable observation: “Let the little children come to Me, and do
not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew
19:14).^[[4]](#note-Miller)^

Paul the Apostle, in pointing out that God preplanned to bring
Christ into the world through Jacob rather than Esau, stated that
the decision was made prior to the birth of the boys: “[F]or the
children not yet being born, *nor having done any good or evil*”
(Romans 9:11, emp. added).^[[4]](#note-Miller)^

## Counter arguments

Historically, some groups of Christians have believed that an
infant is born with an immediate responsibility for sin. This view
suggests that children inherit the guilt of the sins of those who
have lived before them. Infant baptism has been the usual
prescription for this innate sin.^[[1]](#note-Holman)^ Classical
Calvinistic teaching claims that all humans have inherited a
corrupt spiritual nature due to the sin of Adam in the Garden of
Eden. This doctrine generally is referred to as “total depravity.”
Not all contemporary Calvinists agree with the following
conclusions regarding infants and children:

> Calvinism further maintains that, due to this inherited spiritual
> depravity, babies are born with a corrupt nature. Babies,
> therefore, are born depraved and, by definition, are in a “lost”
> state. The only way for babies to be saved is for them to be one of
> the elect—a predetermined few whom God arbitrarily decided to save
> while condemning all others. Hence, free will does not enter into
> the question of salvation. The Calvinist maintains that people
> cannot choose to receive salvation from God. They are in a lost
> condition due to their corrupt spiritual nature, and do not have
> the ability even to desire salvation, let alone to attain
> it.^[[4]](#note-Miller)^

Several biblical passages are often cited to refute the concept of
an "age of accountability":

-   "Even a child is known by his actions, by whether his conduct
    is pure and right." (Prov. 20:11, NIV)
-   "For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his
    wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her
    believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as
    it is, they are holy." (1 Cor. 7:14, NIV)
-   "Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are
    wayward and speak lies." (Ps. 58:3, NIV)
-   "Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my
    mother conceive me." (Ps. 51:5, ESV)

## Effects of culture on morality

The Bible teaches clearly that persons are responsible for their
own actions, not for those of their ancestors. Sin is a willful act
of rebellion against God on the part of an individual (Romans
3:9-18).^[[1]](#note-Holman)^ Current culture is characterized by a
tendency to evade responsibility for one’s action. Lawbreakers
blame parents, genes, and society for their actions. But the Bible
teaches that every accountable human being will one day stand
before God and give account for his or her *own* actions. “For we
shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ” and “each of us
shall give account of himself to God” (Romans
14:10,12).^[[4]](#note-Miller)^
