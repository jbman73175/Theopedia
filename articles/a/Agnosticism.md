**Agnosticism** is a belief that knowledge of the existence or
non-existence of God is impossible. It is often put forth as a
middle ground between [theism](Theism "Theism") and
[atheism](Atheism "Atheism"). Understood this way, agnosticism is
skepticism regarding all things theological. The agnostic may
generally hold that human knowledge is limited to the natural world
-- that the mind is incapable of knowledge of the supernatural.

From a Christian perspective, some would see agnosticism as a
*denial*, like [atheism](Atheism "Atheism"), since natural
revelation reveals to all, Christian or not, that there is a God,
and special revelation, i.e. God's Word in the Bible, reveals the
particular Christian, Triune God.

The term *agnostic* was apparently coined by T. H. Huxley
(1825-1895),^[[1]](#note-0)^ who took his cue from humanist
Enlightenment thinkers David Hume (1711-1776) and
[Immanuel Kant](Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") (1724-1804).
