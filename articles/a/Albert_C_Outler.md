## Life

Outler was born and raised in Georgia and was an Holy
Orders|ordained Methodist Elder who served as pastor in several
appointments. He received his Ph.D. degree from Yale University,
teaching at both Yale and Duke University before beginning a long
tenure at Southern Methodist University in Texas. He served on the
Faith & Order board of the World Council of Churches and was an
official observer at the Second Vatican Council.

## Studies on Wesley

Outler is widely credited with being the first to recognize John
Wesley's method for theologizing, via what Outler referred to as
the
*[Wesleyan Quadrilateral](Wesleyan_Quadrilateral "Wesleyan Quadrilateral")*:
Scripture, Church Tradition, Reason, and Personal Experience. This
understanding of Wesleyan theology is prevalent throughout
Methodism, particularly in The United Methodist Church. Using this
model, Outler was a key figure in organizing the theological
statement put forth by The United Methodist Church after its
formation in 1968.

Throughout his career, Outler edited and published Wesley's works,
and at the time of his death he was chief editor for what has been
called the definitive modern edition. As he encouraged Methodists
to return to Wesley, he is often called "the Father of
*Neo-Wesleyanism*".
