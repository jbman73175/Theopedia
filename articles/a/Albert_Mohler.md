## Early life and education

Mohler is a native of Lakeland in central Florida. As a child he
attended Lake Yale, a Florida Baptist campground. During his
Lakeland years he attended Southside Baptist Church.

Mohler attended college at Florida Atlantic University in Boca
Raton, Florida as a Faculty Scholar. He then received a B. A. from
Samford University, a private, coeducational Baptist-affiliated
college in Birmingham, Alabama. His graduate degrees, an M.Div. and
Ph.D. in "Systematic and Historical Theology," were conferred by
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, also known as Southern
Seminary. Mohler's 1989 dissertation was titled, "Evangelical
Theology and [Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth"): Representative
Models of Response."

## Southern Baptist Theological Seminary

Mohler joined the staff of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Louisville, Kentucky in 1983 as Coordinator of Foundation Support.
In 1987 he became Director of Capital Funding, a post he held until
1989. While still a student he served as assistant to
then-President Roy Honeycutt.

In February 1993, Mohler was appointed President of the Seminary by
conservatives on that institution's board of trustees, succeeding
Roy Honeycutt. The seminary soon saw a wholesale shift towards
conservative theology (characterized by Mohler as a move toward
"confessional fidelity") and a rapid exodus (both voluntary and
compulsory) of more than 60 percent of the faculty.

Other conservative Baptist leaders were elated at the movement:
Paige Patterson, another Southern Baptist seminary president, said
Mohler's leadership “will mean that they recover their evangelical
emphasis there” and that Mohler's Presidency meant that “the worst
of the problems” were over: “Al Mohler," he said, "has the brains
of Erasmus and the courage of Luther.”

## The "Conservative Resurgence"

Mohler was also instrumental in the mid-1990's restructuring of the
Southern Baptist Convention, which saw the Convention shift from a
mixture of moderate and conservative voices to a solidly
conservative base.

He was involved in the drafting of the controversial 2000 revision
of the Baptist Faith and Message, which added an exhortation to
wives to "submit graciously" to their husbands, and removed a
clause referring to Jesus Christ as the standard by which the Bible
is to be interpreted.

A deadline was set for foreign missionaries to confirm their
allegiance to the Baptist Faith and Message in written form. Those
who did not were dismissed or resigned.

## Together For The Gospel

Al Mohler's unlikely circle of strong friendship with
[Mark Dever](Mark_Dever "Mark Dever"),
[C.J. Mahaney](C.J._Mahaney "C.J. Mahaney"), and
[Ligon Duncan](Ligon_Duncan "Ligon Duncan") has given rise to a
movement which aims to prioritize our agreement over the gospel
without pretending other differences don't exist. The 2006
[Together For the Gospel](Together_For_the_Gospel "Together For the Gospel")
conference was the natural outworking of these relationships which
have also led to a wider circle of friendships as the men have been
introduced to each others friends.

Mohler described this event in a blog interview with Adrian
Warnock:

"Together for the Gospel represents a centering in my life and
ministry. At the most basic level, it is established in the
friendship of four men who share so many common commitments and a
common vision. The time spent with Lig, C. J., and Mark has been
one of the best investments of my lifetime. I would wish for other
Christians what I have found in these three friends—a genuine
friendship, accountability, fraternity, and fellowship that the
world can neither sever nor understand. Out of this friendship of
four has grown an extended network of friendships, for which we are
all grateful. The focus of our greatest concern is the health of
Christ’s church in this generation. We are, as our name suggests,
together for the cause of the Gospel."
