physician, and medical [missionary](Missionary "Missionary"). He
was born in Kaysersberg, Alsace-Lorraine, Germany (now in Alsace,
France). He received the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize for founding the

## Background

Schweitzer entered into his intensive studies of theology and
philosophy in 1893 at the University of Strasbourg where he
obtained a doctorate in philosophy in 1899, with a dissertation on
the religious philosophy of
[Immanuel Kant](Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant"), and received his
licentiate in theology in 1900.

Having decided to go to Africa as a medical missionary rather than
as a pastor, Schweitzer in 1905 began the study of medicine at the
University of Strasbourg. In 1913, having obtained his M.D. degree,
he founded his hospital at Lambaréné in French Equatorial Africa.
In 1918 Schweitzer returned to Alsace with his wife, where their
daughter was born (January 1919). They enjoyed several years there
with Albert preaching in his old church, giving lectures and
concerts, taking medical courses, and writing.

Schweitzer returned to Lambaréné in 1924 and except for relatively
short periods of time, spent the remainder of his life there. At
Lambaréné, Schweitzer was doctor and surgeon in the hospital,
pastor of a congregation, administrator of a village,
superintendent of buildings and grounds, writer of scholarly books,
commentator on contemporary history, musician, host to countless
visitors.

## His philosophy

Schweitzer's philosophy is developed in Philosophy of Civilization
(*The Decay and the Restoration of Civilization*, 1923;
*Civilization and Ethics*, 1923; and *Reverence for Life*, transl.
1969). "Reverence for life" is the term Schweitzer used for a
universal concept of ethics. He believed that such an ethic would
reconcile the drives of altruism and egoism by requiring a respect
for the lives of all other beings and by demanding the highest
development of the individual’s resources.

## His theology

As a young theologian his first major work, by which he gained a
great reputation, was *The Quest of the Historical Jesus* (1906),
in which he interpreted the life of Jesus in the light of Jesus'
own eschatological convictions. He argued that, of all the sayings
attributed to Jesus in the Gospels, the ones that are most
certainly His are the ones that give the impression that the end of
the world is at hand. (Interestingly, the well-known group called
the Jesus Seminar, which likewise sets out to rate the sayings
attributed to Jesus with different degrees of certainty, has drawn
the opposite conclusion, and rejects all the so-called apocalyptic
sayings of Jesus as unauthentic.) Schweitzer himself drew the
conclusion that Jesus believed in the imminent end of the world,
that he was wrong, and that therefore he was not infallible or
inspired or divine.

"Schweitzer still called on people to be followers of Jesus of
Nazareth - not by holding to what he believed about himself or to
the specifics of what he taught, but by following him in his
willingness to give himself for the sake of humanity."
[Longenecker](http://www.mcmaster.ca/mjtm/2-51.htm)

He furthered his reputation as a New Testament scholar with other
theological studies including his medical degree dissertation,
*The Psychiatric Study of Jesus* (1911), and
*The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle* (1930). In his study of Paul he
examined the eschatological beliefs of Paul and through this the
message of the New Testament.

He published other books on theology, including a revolutionary
work on New Testament criticism that shaped Western liberal
theology and several books on
[Kant](Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant").
