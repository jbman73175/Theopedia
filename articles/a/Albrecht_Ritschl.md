**Albrecht Ritschl** (1822-1889) was a German Protestant theologian
and historian. He was one of the most important
[liberal](Liberal "Liberal") theologians of his time. His theology
is often labeled as "moral value" as it focused on the ethical
implications and their relevance for the witness of the church.
Furthermore, he rejected all
[natural theology](Natural_theology "Natural theology"),
[mysticism](index.php?title=Mysticism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mysticism (page does not exist)"),
and [metaphysics](Metaphysics "Metaphysics") due to his belief that
theology must focus on ethical issues.

Ritschl's theology attracted other theologians as well, including
Wilhelm Herrmann and
[Adolf von Harnack](index.php?title=Adolf_von_Harnack&action=edit&redlink=1 "Adolf von Harnack (page does not exist)").
