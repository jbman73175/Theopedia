The only alcoholic drink identified in the [Bible](Bible "Bible")
is wine. Another term that is used is *strong drink*; however this
is still to be understood as wine. The [NIV](NIV "NIV") uses the
term "beer" (i.e. Proverbs 20:1), but this is a loose translation.

## Alcohol in the Bible

The [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") uses wine
symbolically as an example of God's blessing, and it was also
acceptable as an offering on the altar
([Exodus 29:40](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2029:39-41;&version=47;)).
It also metaphorically represents something good that God has
prepared for those who receive it
([Proverbs 9:5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%209:5&version=47),
[Isaiah 55:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2055:1;&version=47;)).
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") performed his first miracle at the wedding
in Cana by turning water into wine
([John 2:1-11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202:1-11;&version=47;)),
and even included the drinking of wine at the
[Last Supper](Communion "Communion") as remembrance of his shed
blood (Matthew 26:27-29; Mark 14:23-25; Luke 22:20; 1 Corinthians
11:25-26).

In contrast, Scripture also reminds us that alcohol can have bad
effects. After consuming too much, alcohol causes one to stagger
([Isaiah 28:7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2028:7;&version=47;)),
prevents rulers from making wise choices (Proverbs 31:4-5), brings
sorrow and contention, and that it "bites like a serpent, and
stings like a viper"
([Proverbs 23:29-35](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2023:29-35;&version=47;)).
The writer of [Proverbs](Book_of_Proverbs "Book of Proverbs") even
says that, "Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, and whoever
is led astray by it is not wise" (Proverbs 20:1).

Be that as it may, Christians should also be wise about *when* they
drink. [Paul](Paul "Paul") reminded those in his letter to the
Romans that a Christian should never put a stumbling block in the
way of another
([Romans 14:13ff](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:13-23;&version=47;)).
Paul said that he would eat no meat while the world remains, if
that would put a stumbling block in the way of a brother.
Christians should be aware if alcohol is a stumbling block to those
around them, and if so, temporarily abstain (cf.
[1 Corinthians 8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%208;&version=47;)).
Many Christians, especially in America, *never* drink because of
some of the connotations and associations that cannot be separated
from the drinking of alcoholic beverages in America. American
Christians, however, must be careful not to judge Christians,
especially those from cultures such as Germany's, where the
connotations and associations of alcohol are typically much
different.

## Drunkenness

The Bible is clear in its condemnation of drunkenness. Paul tells
Christians that they are to not get drunk on wine, but are to be
filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 5:18). The idea here is that
Christians are to be controlled (i.e. filled) by the Spirit in the
same way that a person is controlled by the alcohol they have
consumed. The Christian must avoid anything that would gain control
over him and prevent the Holy Spirit from controlling. Paul also
tells us that drunkenness stems from our sinful nature and is a
"work of the flesh" (Galatians 5:19-21), and that it is a deterrent
to inheriting the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:10). Paul goes so
far as to say that Christians should not associate with others who
claim to be Christians but are still drunkards (1 Corinthians
5:11). Lastly, those who are appointed to leadership positions in
the church are also not to drink excessively (1 Timothy 3:3, 8;
Titus 1:7, 2:3; see also
[Proverbs 31:3-7](index.php?title=Proverbs_31&action=edit&redlink=1 "Proverbs 31 (page does not exist)")).

## Temperance

The term temperance can mean either "self-control" or "moderation".
This is the biblical idea that can be related to the drinking of
alcohol (Galatians 5:23; Titus 2:2). Christian liberty permits one
to either abstain or to partake, however this should be based on
whether it will cause another Christian to stumble, or if one is
aware of their own temptations to consume too much. Christians
should not be afraid of consuming alcohol, but should be wise in
their choices that involve it.
[G. K. Chesterton](G._K._Chesterton "G. K. Chesterton") gives
helpful advice:

"Idolatry is committed, not merely by setting up false gods, but
also by setting up false devils; by making men afraid of war or
alcohol, or economic law, when they should be afraid of spiritual
corruption and cowardice."
That said, Christians who do drink (thus claiming to have a
"strong" conscience as Paul says in Romans 14) should not look down
on those who have decided to totally abstain. In Jeremiah 35, the
Rechabites are strongly commended for following their father
Rechab's instruction that his children should not drink alcohol,
nor eat grapes, nor own a vineyard, nor even own a house, but
instead live in tents (thus utterly precluding the possibility of
consuming alcohol). While Rechab went much farther than even the
more extreme advocates of teetotalism would have gone, he was
strongly commended by the Lord in an age of rampant drunkenness.
