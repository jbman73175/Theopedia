**Alcoholics Anonymous** is a large organization that tries to help
break those that are addicted to alcohol of their addiction.
Although AA (as Alcoholics Anonymous is frequently referred to) has
helped many decrease their dependence on alcohol, many conservative
religious groups have subjected some of their methodology to
criticism because they depend so much on modern psychological
methods which are antithetical to
Scripture^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^.
Instead of appealing to the True and Living God, members of AA are
often asked to find a "higher power", which may even be as mundane
an item as a watch. This resembles "exchanging the glory of the
incorruptible God" for a
[materialistic idol](Idolatry "Idolatry").
