Alister McGrath
**Alister E. McGrath**, born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, holds
the Chair in Theology, Ministry and Education at King’s College
London. He was previously Professor of
[Historical Theology](Historical_theology "Historical theology") at
Oxford University and Director of the Oxford Center for Christian
Apologetics.

Originally a student of science, in 1977 McGrath was awarded a PhD
in Biochemistry from Oxford University for his work on molecular
biophysics. Following his conversion from atheism to Christianity,
he studied divinity at St. John's College at Cambridge (1978-80).
It was during this time that he studied for ordination in the
Church of England. McGrath was elected University Research Lecturer
in Theology at Oxford University in 1993, and also served as
research professor of theology at Regent College, Vancouver, from
1993-9. He earned an Oxford Doctorate of Divinity in 2001 for his
research on historical and systematic theology.

McGrath has written many books on the interaction of science and
faith and is the producer of the 'Scientific Theology' project,
encouraging a dialogue between the natural sciences and Christian
theology. McGrath is a strong critic of Richard Dawkins, Oxford
biology professor and one of the most outspoken
[atheists](Atheist "Atheist"). He has addressed Dawkins' criticism
of religion in several of his books, most notably in
*Dawkins Delusion* published in 2007 by SPCK and IVP.
