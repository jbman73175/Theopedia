"The **Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals** is a broad coalition
of [evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical") Christians from various
denominations, including [Baptist](Baptist "Baptist"),
Congregational (Independent), [Anglican](Anglican "Anglican")
(Episcopal), [Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian"), Reformed,
and [Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran"). The purpose of the Alliance’s
existence is to call the [Church](Church "Church"), amidst a dying
culture, to repent of its worldliness, to recover and confess the
truth of God’s Word as did the reformers, and to see that truth
embodied in doctrine, worship, and life."^[[1]](#note-0)^ The
Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals is often abbreviated as "ACE".

## Background

In 1994, Dr.
[James Montgomery Boice](James_Montgomery_Boice "James Montgomery Boice")
invited a number of key Christian leaders to meet in Philadelphia.
Concerned that North American Christianity had yielded to the
spirit of the age, especially in terms of Christianity’s
consumerism, pragmatism, politicization, and disregard for
theological clarity, these leaders lamented that many churches had
become very unbiblical -- including some churches that publicly
affirmed their belief in biblical authority.

Consequently, the Alliance was formed to constructively address
these concerns within the wider Christian community. This resulted
in the formulation of
[The Cambridge Declaration of the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals](The_Cambridge_Declaration_of_the_Alliance_of_Confessing_Evangelicals "The Cambridge Declaration of the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals"),
which restated the [Five Solas](Five_Solas "Five Solas") of the
Reformation in a context for today.
