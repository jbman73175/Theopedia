**Ambrose** (339-397) "bishop of Milan, biblical critic, and
initiator of ideas that provided a model for medieval conceptions
of church–state relations. His literary works have been acclaimed
as masterpieces of Latin eloquence, and his musical accomplishments
are remembered in his hymns. Ambrose is also remembered as the
teacher who converted and baptized St.
[Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") of Hippo, the great Christian
theologian, and as a model bishop who viewed the church as rising
above the ruins of the Roman Empire."^[[1]](#note-0)^

While he was serving as the governor of Milan, Ambrose was drafted
into ecclesiastical service. In his role as bishop of Milan he was
a biblical and social critic, fighter of heresy, and political
theorist. Both before and after assuming the bishopric, Ambrose was
strongly influenced by the Neoplatonic tradition, and he carried
those ideas into his theology.
