## History

The ASV is rooted in the work that was done with the
**Revised Version (RV)**, a late 19th-century British revision of
the [King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version")
of the Bible. In 1870, an invitation was extended to American
religious leaders for scholars to work on the *Revised Version*
project. A year later, 30 scholars were chosen by
[Philip Schaff](Philip_Schaff "Philip Schaff"). These scholars
began work in 1872.

Any suggestion the American team had would be accepted by the
British team only if 2/3 of the British team agreed. This principle
was backed up by an agreement that if their suggestions were put
into the appendix of the RV, the American team would not publish
their version for 14 years. The appendix had about 300 suggestions
in it.

In 1881, the RV New Testament was released. Four years later, the
Old Testament appeared. Around this time, the British team
disbanded. Also around this time, pirated editions of the RV
appeared with the suggestions of the American team in the main
text. In 1898, publishers for Oxford and Cambridge Universities
published their own editions of the RV with the American
suggestions included. However, these suggestions were reduced in
number.

In 1901, the 14 year agreement between the American and British
teams expired. The *American Standard Version* was published the
same year. It was copyrighted in North America to ensure the purity
of the ASV text, although the copyright has since expired. The
copyright was a reaction to tampering with the text of the Revised
Version by some U.S. publishers, as noted above, allegedly in the
interest of the American reading public, which was legally possible
as there was never a U.S. copyright filed for the RV. By the time
of the ASV's copyright expiry, interest in this translation had
largely waned in the light of newer and more recent ones, and
textual corruption hence never became the issue with the ASV that
it had with the RV.

## Reasons and features

There were two rationales for the ASV. First, to obviate any
justification for the pirated editions of the RV that had been
circulating. Another reason was to use more of the suggestions the
American team had preferred, since the British team used few of
their suggestions in the first place, even in the later version
which they had published incorporating some of them. Interestingly,
while many of the suggestions of the American scholars were based
on the differences between American and British usage, many others
were based on differences in scholarship and what the American
revisers felt the best translation to be. Consequently, there were
several changes to the KJV text in the ASV that were not present in
the RV. The name of the Almighty (the Tetragrammaton) was rendered
*Jehovah* instead of *LORD*. *Holy Ghost* was dropped in favor of
*Holy Spirit*. Page headings were added and footnotes were
improved.

## Revisions

The ASV was the basis of two revisions. They were the
*[Revised Standard Version](Revised_Standard_Version "Revised Standard Version")*
(1952) and the
*[New American Standard Bible](New_American_Standard_Bible "New American Standard Bible")*
(1971). Kenneth Taylor used the ASV as the basis for his paraphrase
of the Bible, which was published in 1971. The text, along with
original manuscripts, is also the primary basis for the World
English Bible.

## Usage by the [Jehovah's Witnesses](Jehovah's_Witnesses "Jehovah's Witnesses")

The ASV was used for many years by the Jehovah's Witnesses. They
first began publishing the ASV in 1944 and have continued
publishing the translation until the present time. The reasons for
their choosing of the ASV were twofold: One reason for adoption of
the ASV was due to its usage of "Jehovah" as the Divine Name, which
was congruent with their [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine"), although
their usage of it seems to have predated the release of the ASV.
Also, there was a perception that the ASV had improved the
translation of some verses in the King James Version, and in other
places it reduced the verses that they found to be erroneously
translated in the KJV to mere footnotes, removed from the main text
altogether.

From 1944 to 1963, the Jehovah's Witnesses printed and distributed
884,994 copies of the ASV. The Witnesses' usage of the ASV was
supplanted by their current use of the
*New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures*, a translation made
by members of their group, and the rights to which are controlled
by the Watchtower Society, which is their publishing arm. The ASV
is still freely available to nonmembers from Jehovah's Witnesses.

## Availability

The ASV is almost completely out of print. A mail order bookseller
in Texas known as Star Bible Publishing
[[1]](http://www.starbible.com/) claims to be the only publisher of
the ASV today. Copies of the ASV may be commonly found in used
bookstores, however.

Because the ASV text is out of copyright, it sees wide distribution
in electronic form on the internet. Most electronic copies of the
ASV seem to come from the same original scanned or otherwise
produced electronic edition and have a number of mistakes in
common, such as the omission of the word "who" in the phrase "ye
who would be" in [Galatians](Galatians "Galatians") 5:4. Some
internet copies have corrected some of the typos.

Also because of its copyright status, the ASV has also been used as
the foundation of the World English Bible, a modern public domain
English updating that is being made available on the internet.
