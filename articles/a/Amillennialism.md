**Amillennialism** (Greek: a- "no" + millennialism) is the view in
Christian eschatology which states that Christ is *presently*
reigning through the Church, and that the "1000 years" of
Revelation 20:1-6 is a metaphorical reference to the present church
age which will culminate in Christ's return. It stands in contrast
to [premillennialism](Premillennialism "Premillennialism"), which
states that Christ will return *prior to* a literal 1000 year
earthly reign; and
[postmillennialism](Postmillennialism "Postmillennialism"), which
states that Christ's return will *follow* a 1000 year golden age
ushered in by the church.

## Terminology

Although the term *amillennialism* is widely used, some prefer the
term *realized millennialism*, saying it describes the position
more accurately than the former, which emphasizes what they do not
believe about the millennium, rather than what they do believe.

## Overview

Amillennialism teaches that the thousand year reign of Christ
mentioned in Revelation 20:1-6 is symbolic of the current church
age, rather than a literal future 1000 year reign. It contends that
the period described in Revelation 20 was inaugurated (i.e. began)
at
[Christ's resurrection](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus")
and will continue until His
[Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming"). Amillennialism
holds that while Christ's reign during the
[millennium](Millennial_kingdom "Millennial kingdom") is spiritual
in nature, at the end of the church age Christ will return in final
judgment and establish a permanent physical reign. Also taught by
amillennialism is that the binding of Satan in Revelation 20:1-3
has already occurred, and means that "he might not deceive the
nations any longer" (Revelation 20:3) by preventing the spread of
the [gospel](Gospel "Gospel"). ^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Principles

There are several principles which, while not entirely unique to
amillennialism, combine to form the grounding from which this
understanding of eschatology springs.

### The analogy of faith and biblical theology

The [analogy of faith](Analogy_of_faith "Analogy of faith") is a
Reformation principle for the interpretation of Scripture, which
can be expressed as "Scripture interprets Scripture". The
fundamental principle of
[biblical theology](Biblical_theology "Biblical theology") is that
of
[progressive revelation](Progressive_Revelation "Progressive Revelation"),
which states that [God](God "God") reveals Himself in increasing
measure throughout history, and that His revelation climaxes in the
person of His Son, Jesus Christ.

As a result of these principles, we expect the
[New Testament to interpret to the Old](NT_use_of_the_OT "NT use of the OT"),
all the while showing us God, in Christ, more clearly.

### Two-age theology

One of the major contributions of Reformed theology to this area of
eschatology, and allied areas, has been the application of the
two-age framework. This New Testament paradigm looks at Christian
experience in terms of the 'now' and the 'not yet'. Perhaps that
most eloquent and well-known statement of this principle is the
Apostle Paul's words to the Corinthian church, "For now we see
through a glass, darkly; but then face to face" (1 Corinthians
13:12). An example of the way this framework is applied in the New
Testament is in the theme of "new creation". Beloved of New
Testament writers, this theme is often referred to in terms
indicating that it is both a present reality (2 Corinthians 5:17)
and a future hope (Romans 8:20-21); the message of the New
Testament is that the new creation is something we taste now and
will, one day, know fully.

### Covenant theology

While the covenant theology in its most developed form is
associated with the Reformed tradition, Lutheranism and Roman
Catholicism both apply aspects of the covenant theology in their
own expressions of eschatology, which are also amillennial. This is
most clearly seen in the agreement between the three traditions
that the church is, in some sense and by some means, the inheritor
of the promises in Scripture — in short, that just as Israel *was*
the people of God in the Old Testament, so the church *is* the
people of God in the New Testament. Such a belief, called
[supersessionism](Supersessionism "Supersessionism") and denigrated
as "replacement theology" by its critics, has been the historic
belief of the church.^[[3]](#note-2)^

    be denied. Although it is true that some anti-Semites have
    attempted to use supersessionism to justify their wickedness, in
    fact it is precisely the succession of the covenants which shows
    such attitudes to be sinful.
