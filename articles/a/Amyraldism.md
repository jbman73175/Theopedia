> "Amyraldianism . . .
implies a twofold will of God, whereby he wills the salvation of
all humankind on condition of faith but wills the salvation of the
elect specifically and unconditionally. The theological difficulty
of God's will having been frustrated by the fact that not all are
saved is met by the argument that God only willed their salvation
on the condition of faith. Where an individual has no faith, then
God has not willed the salvation of that person?" [^1]
