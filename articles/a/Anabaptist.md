The term **Anabaptist** refers to Christians of the
[Radical Reformation](Radical_Reformation "Radical Reformation")
who rejected the teachings of both the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
and the church reformers during the
[Protestant Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation").
They were therefore denounced and persecuted by both. The term
Anabaptist literally means to "re-baptize."

Anabaptists were known not only for their rejection of
[infant baptism](Infant_baptism "Infant baptism"), which gave them
their name, but for their pacifism, and denial of the
visible/invisible church distinction. Groups such as the
[Amish](index.php?title=Amish&action=edit&redlink=1 "Amish (page does not exist)"),
[Mennonites](Mennonites "Mennonites"), and
[Hutterites](index.php?title=Hutterites&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hutterites (page does not exist)")
are considered decendants of the early Anabaptists.

## Pacifism

[Pacifism](index.php?title=Pacifism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pacifism (page does not exist)")
was a key distinguishing feature of the Anabaptist movement. The
Schleitheim Confession states "but the weapons of Christians are
spiritual, against the fortification of the devil. The worldly are
armed with steel and iron, but Christians are armed with the armour
of God, with truth, righteousness, peace, faith, salvation, and
with the Word of God."
