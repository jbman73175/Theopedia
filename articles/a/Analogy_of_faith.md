The **analogy of faith** was a key principle of
[interpretation](Interpretation_of_the_Bible "Interpretation of the Bible")
taught by the Reformers which which teaches that Scripture should
interpret Scripture. This principle is stated in the Westminster
Confession (1.9) in this manner: "The infallible rule of
interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself: and therefore,
when there is a question about the true and full sense of any
Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be searched and
known by other places that speak more clearly."

"There must be a consistency in all revealed truth because it
represents absolute truth in the mind of God. Therefore each
passage can have only one certain and simple sense. As the
infallibly inspired word of God, the Scriptures are reliable,
self-consistent and carry within them all that is needed for
clarity. Since all that God makes known fits with what He knows
perfectly, it is always proper to assume that no contradictions or
dual realities can be attached to what He speaks."
[Bob Burridge](http://www.girs.com/library/theology/syllabus/interp.html)

[Charles Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge"), in his
*Systematic Theology*, has expressed the idea this way: "If the
Scriptures be what they claim to be, the word of God, they are the
work of one mind, and that mind divine. From this it follows that
Scripture cannot contradict Scripture. God cannot teach in one
place anything which is inconsistent with what He teaches in
another. **Hence Scripture must explain Scripture**. If a passage
admits of different interpretations, that only can be the true one
which agrees with what the Bible teaches elsewhere on the same
subject.^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Basis for the term

In Romans 12:6 Paul says that each one was to exercise his
[gift of prophecy](Gift_of_prophecy "Gift of prophecy"), i.e., of
teaching, "according to the proportion of faith." The
[Greek](Greek "Greek") word for *proportion* here is *analogia*,
and hence the phrase *analogy of faith*. The meaning is, that the
utterances of the "prophet" were not to fluctuate according to his
own impulses or independent thoughts, but were to be in accordance
with the truth revealed to him as a believer. Following the
Reformation, this phrase was used to mean that all Scripture was to
be interpreted with reference to all other Scripture. In other
words, no single text or expression of Scripture was to be isolated
or interpreted in a way contrary to its general teaching.

## Cautions and concerns

The principle of allowing Scripture to interpret Scripture
*is a valid aspect* of the "analogy of faith," presupposing a unity
and self-consistency in Scripture as the work of God. Critics from
within conservative
[evangelicalism](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") warn of potential
misuse when the analogy of faith is restricted to that which one
finds harmonious and non-contradictory at the expense of sound
[hermeneutics](Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics") and
[exegesis](Exegesis "Exegesis").

[Walter Kaiser](Walter_Kaiser "Walter Kaiser"), in
*Toward an Exegetical Theology*, says "the Church at large (since
the time of the Reformers especially) is in error when she uses the
analogy of faith (*analogia fidei*) as an exegetical device for
extricating meaning from or importing meaning to texts that
appeared earlier than the passage where the teaching is set forth
most clearly or perhaps even for the first time" (p.82). While the
concept of progressive revelation suggests interpreting the Old
Testament in light of the New, Kaiser argues that this is not a
license to read meanings into the OT that are not there. He sees
misapplications of the "analogy of faith" in the past doing just
that.

[Daniel Fuller](Daniel_Fuller "Daniel Fuller") also sees the use of
the "analogy of faith" by the Reformers, evident in
[Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"), as introducing a
subjectivity that sometimes contradicts the very idea of
[Sola Scriptura](Sola_Scriptura "Sola Scriptura") for which they
argued (see Fuller, in external links below).
