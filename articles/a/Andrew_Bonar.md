**Andrew Alexander Bonar**, a minister of the Free Church of
Scotland; born Edinburgh May 29, 1810, youngest brother of
[Horatius Bonar](Horatius_Bonar "Horatius Bonar"); died Glasgow
December 30, 1892.

He studied at Edinburgh; was minister at Collace, Perthshire, 1838
– 1856; and of the Finnieston Church, Glasgow, 1856 till his death.
He joined the Free Church in 1843, and was its moderator in 1878.
He was identified with evangelical and revival movements and
adhered to the doctrine of premillennialism. With Robert Murray
McCheyne he visited Palestine in 1839 to inquire into the condition
of the Jews there. During the visit of
[Dwight L. Moody](Dwight_L._Moody "Dwight L. Moody") to Britain in
1874 and 1875, Moody was warmly welcomed by Bonar, despite the
latter receiving considerable criticism from other Calvinist
ministers in the Free Church.
