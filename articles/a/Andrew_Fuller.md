**Andrew Fuller** (1754-1815), was an English Baptist pastor. He
pastored two congregations, one at Soham (1775-1782) and one at
Kettering (1782-1815) and died Sunday, May 7, 1815 in Kettering,
Northamptonshire, England. It was estimated that 2000 people
attended his funeral. John Keen Hall, Fuller's assistant from 1812,
succeeded. [[1]](http://www.fullerbaptist.org.uk/history.html)
Fuller was chiefly distinguished in connection with the foundation
of the Baptist Missionary Society, to which he devoted much time
and effort during his life.

He was a biblically-based Particular Baptist standing on the
doctrines of Grace against
[Sandamanianism](index.php?title=Sandamanianism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sandamanianism (page does not exist)")
and [Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism") on the one hand and
[Hyper-Calvinism](Hyper-Calvinism "Hyper-Calvinism") on the other.
His most notable work was "The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation"
reconciling objections to Reformed doctrines of Grace and Election
regarding evangelism.

"My assessment at this point, 192 years [*sic*, should be 162
years] after his death, is that his primary impact on history has
been the impetus that his life and thought gave to the modern
missionary movement, specifically through the sending and
supporting of William Carey to India in 1793. That historical
moment—the sending of William Carey and his team—marked the opening
of the modern missionary movement." John Piper
