*"Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."*
Ephesians 4:26-27

**Anger** is a subject to which which the Bible speaks frequently.
There are two Greek words that appear in the New Testament that are
equivalent to our English word anger. One means “passion, energy”
and the other means “agitated, boiling.” ^^[[1]](#note-0)^^ Anger
could, then, be defined as a natural, God-given energy. Since God
Himself, who can not sin, is angered (Psalm 7:11) and believers are
commanded to be angry (Ephesians 4:26).

However, a careful distinction is made in Scripture over “righteous
anger” and “unrighteous anger.” Where does the difference lie?
Several things can be deduced from both our knowledge of God and
Scriptural examples of anger. First, we know that God is perfectly
righteous and holy, so, therefore, nothing in and of Himself nor in
line with His own character would anger Him. Any anger, then, that
God posses must be directed at sin (anything contrary to God’s
character) and if we, as His children, are to be like Him our anger
must be limited to that. “Righteous” anger, then, like its “evil
twin” is defensive. Only, in the case of righteous anger, it is
limited to being defensive–evil anger being in defense of self (or
anything that is or anyone acting outside of or in opposition to
God and His character) and “righteous” anger being in defense of
God, ultimately (for an attack on God’s character is really an
attack on His Person and an attack on His creation comes to the
same result as well.) No wander Satan, the accuser of the brethren,
seeks to destroy man, God’s beloved creation! Another thing should
be noted, getting back to where we started. Anger itself is not
both a good and bad thing. It is the root cause of the God-given
energy of anger where lies the true place of right or wrong.

Godly examples of anger include Paul’s confronting Peter because of
his wrong example (Galatians 2:11-14), David angered over the
injustice shared by Nathan the prophet (2 Samuel 12), Nehemiah’s
anger over Israel’s sin (Nehemiah 5:1-13) and Jesus driving out
those misusing the Jewish Temple (John 2:13-18). Ungodly examples
include the incident of Moses hitting the rock (Numbers 20:10-11),
Nebuchadnezzar’s anger in the story of the fiery furnace (Daniel
3:13, 19) and the older brother’s anger in the parable of the
prodigal son (Luke 15:25-31).

We tend to let our own human emotions lead us instead of allowing
the Spirit of God to direct us through His Holy Word. Anger, then,
should not control us, but be subdued under the direction of the
Holy Spirit and used by Him to bring about His ultimate purpose:
the glory of God.
