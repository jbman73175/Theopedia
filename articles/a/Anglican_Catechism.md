The **Anglican Catechism** is described in the
[Book of Common Prayer](Book_of_Common_Prayer "Book of Common Prayer")
as "an instruction to be learned by every person before he be
brought to the confirmed by the Bishop." Whereas the
[39 Articles](Articles_of_Religion_(Anglican) "Articles of Religion (Anglican)")
focus on how the [Anglican](Anglicanism "Anglicanism") Church
differs from the [Roman](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism")
Church, the Catechism provides a more comprehensive statement of
faith for Anglicans as well as a guide to faithful living.
