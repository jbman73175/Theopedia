The **Anglican Church of Canada** is the Canadian branch of the
[Anglican Communion](Anglicanism "Anglicanism"). It is made up of
800,000 members worshipping in 30 dioceses; over 2 million
Canadians, or 6.9% of the population, declared themselves as
Anglican in the 2001 Census. The Primate of the church is the Most
Rev. Andrew Hutchison.

The chief governing body of the church is the General Synod, which
meets every three years and is made up of lay people, priests, and
bishops from each diocese.

The church is in full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in Canada under the Waterloo Declaration.

## Dioceses and provinces

The Anglican Church is divided into four ecclesiastical provinces,
and 30 dioceses. Each province has its own archbishop and each
diocese has a [bishop](Bishop "Bishop"). The list of dioceses below
indicates in parentheses the Canadian provinces in which the
dioceses are located.

**Province of Canada** Founded in 1860, it consists of seven
dioceses:

-   *Montreal* (Quebec),
-   *Quebec* (whose borders are consistent with Lower Canada
    outside of Montreal),
-   *Fredericton* (New Brunswick),
-   *Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island* (Nova Scotia and Prince
    Edward Island),
-   *Western Newfoundland* (Newfoundland and Labrador),
-   *Central Newfoundland* (Newfoundland and Labrador), and
-   *Eastern Newfoundland and Labrador* (Newfoundland and
    Labrador).

**Province of Rupert's Land** Formed in 1875, it is made up of ten
dioceses:

## History

The first Anglican clergy arrived in Canada as chaplains on John
Cabot's expedition in 1497. The first Anglican
[Eucharist](Eucharist "Eucharist") on Canadian territory was
celebrated in 1578 by Robert Wolfall, who was chaplain to Martin
Frobisher's expedition to the Arctic. The Parish of St. John the
Baptist in St. John's, Newfoundland is the oldest Anglican parish
in Canada, founded in 1699 in response to a petition drafted by the
Anglican townsfolk of St. John's and sent to the Bishop of London,
the Rt. Rev. Henry Compton.

Members of the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England")
established the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in 1701
which provided missionaries to Canada until 1940. Another Anglican
mission, the Church Missionary Society was established in 1799, and
sent missionaries to try to convert Canada's First Nations until
World War I. The Church of England in Canada, as it was called
until the 1950s, established numerous residential schools which
sought to assimilate native peoples into British concepts of
civilization.

The Anglican Church was a dominant feature of the compact
governments that dominated the colonies in British North America.
Adherents to the Church of England were also numerous amongst the
United Empire Loyalists who fled to Canada after the American
Revolution.

After the conquest of Quebec and the American Revolution, many
leading Anglicans argued for the Church of England to become the
established church in the Canadian colonies. The Church of England
was established by law in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island. In Lower Canada (now Quebec), the presence of a
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") majority made
establishment in that province politically unwise. In Upper Canada
(now Ontario), leading dissenters such as
[Methodist](Methodist "Methodist") minister Egerton Ryerson argued
against establishment. Following the Upper Canada Rebellion and the
Durham Report and establishment of responsible government in the
1840s, the unpopularity of the Anglican-dominated Family Compact
made establishment a moot point. The Church was disestablished in
Nova Scotia in 1850 and Upper Canada in 1854. By the time of
Canadian confederation in 1867, the Church of England was
disestablished throughout British North America.

The Clergy reserves, land that had been reserved for use by the
Protestant clergy, became a major issue in the mid-19th century.
Anglicans argued that the land was meant for their exclusive use,
while other Protestant denominations demanded that it be divided
among them.

Until the 1830s, the Anglican church in Canada was treated as the
property of the Church of England: bishops were appointed by the
church in England, and funding for the church came from the British
Parliament. The first Canadian synods were established in the
1850s, giving the Canadian church a degree of self-government. As a
result of a Judicial Committee of the Privy Council decision in
1861 (Long v. Gray), all Anglican churches in colonies of the
British Empire became self-governing. Even so, the first General
Synod for all of Canada was not held until 1893. In that meeting,
Robert Machray was chosen as the Canadian church's first Primate.

In recent years the Anglican Church of Canada has been a leading
force for liberal reform within the Anglican Communion. In the
1970s, Primate Ted Scott argued at the Lambeth Conference in favour
of women's ordination. The Anglican Church of Canada ordained its
first female minister in 1976 and its first female bishop in 1993.
More recently, beginning in 2002, the New Westminster Diocese has
permitted the blessing of same sex unions, a move that has resulted
in condemnation from other Anglican churches around the world and
has threatened an international schism. Just over a decade earlier,
in 1992 an Anglican priest, James Ferry, was brought before a
Bishops' Court for being in a same-sex relationship. Ferry was
stripped of his licence to preach and "inhibited" from practising
other Anglican rituals. Ferry left the church and joined the
Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto; in 1998, Ferry was
partially reinstated. As of 2004, the Anglican Church has not
resolved the either the question of ordaining non-celibate gay and
lesbian clergy or the question of blessing same-sex unions.

## Primates

Primates of the Anglican Church of Canada are elected by the

years they have retired at the age of 70. There have been twelve

-   George Frederick Kingston (1947 – 1950)
-   Walter Barfoot (1950 – 1959)
