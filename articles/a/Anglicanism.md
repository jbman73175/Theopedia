**Anglicanism** is the general name for the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England") and
includes other churches worldwide with a connection to the Church
of England, notably within the Anglican Communion.

The key document that distinguishes Anglicans from other
denominations is the
[Book of Common Prayer](Book_of_Common_Prayer "Book of Common Prayer")
which specifies, for example:

-   The supremacy of Scripture in all matters of theology
-   Concurrence with the
    [Apostles' Creed](Apostles'_Creed "Apostles' Creed") and the
    [Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed")
-   [Liturgies](Liturgy "Liturgy") for regular services such as
    Holy Communion, Morning Prayer, and Evensong
-   Liturgies for special events such as Baptisms, Marriages,
    Funerals, and Ordination of clergy
-   A table of Bible readings for every day of the year
-   [Thirty-nine Articles](Thirty-nine_Articles "Thirty-nine Articles")
    of religion that clarify how Anglican theology and practice
    differed from Roman Catholic theology and practice in 1662.

Anglicanism in the United States is represented by the
[Episcopal Church](Episcopal_Church "Episcopal Church") which is
part of the Anglican Communion and which takes its name from the
[episcopalian](Episcopalian "Episcopalian") form of its polity.

## Look and feel of Anglicanism

A newcomer to Anglican practice will observe the following "look
and feel" to the services and the organization:

-   Large portions of each service follow a formal
    [liturgy](Liturgy "Liturgy") where members of the congregation
    recite prayers together (traditionally from the Book of Common
    Prayer), listen to scripture read from the front of the church, and
    sing hymns or modern songs together;
-   The clergy wear traditional
    [vestments](http://www.kencollins.com/glossary/vestments.htm) or
    robes, the design of which can date back to the early centuries of
    the church
-   the church is hierarchical and
    [episcopal](Episcopal_(polity) "Episcopal (polity)"), with
    authority ascending roughly as follows:
    -   Junior priests report to the senior priest or "rector" of a
        parish;
    -   Rectors and all other priests in a "diocese" are appointed by,
        and report to, the bishop of that diocese;
    -   That bishop is elected by a "synod" of lay people and clergy
        from the diocese, but once in office is relatively autonomous
    -   the church recognizes ecclesiastical "provinces" (often
        associated with specific nations) made up of many diocese and
        presided over by an archbishop. The archbishop has very limited
        power to give direction to one of the bishops

-   Church business is supervised by a church council or "vestry"
    predominantly made up of lay people. Some of the leaders are
    designated as "wardens." This is particularly true in The
    [Episcopal Church](Episcopal_Church "Episcopal Church") of the
    United States. The parish structure varies by province.

-   Anglicans claim an unbroken line of Apostolic Succession from
    the 12 Apostles. Each bishop is ordained through the laying on of
    hands of other bishops and Anglicans believe that this tradition
    represents a thread back through the pre-reformation Roman church
    to Jesus Himself.

## Diversity within Anglicanism

The practices and effective theology of the Anglican church vary
dramatically from church to church and around the globe. Very
generally, practices can be classified as follows:

-   [Liberal](Liberalism "Liberalism") Anglicans: see theological
    authority as a
    [Three Legged Stool](http://www.episcopalian.org/pbs1928/Articles/Hooker's%20stool.htm)
    where the bible, church tradition, and reason are equally
    authoritative, contrary to the Book of Common Prayer. Practically,
    this means they emphasize grace and communion, shy away from
    discussions of sin and judgement, and are often drawn to a
    "[social gospel](Social_Gospel "Social Gospel")."
-   [Orthodox](Orthodox "Orthodox") Anglicans: give Scripture
    supreme authority over all other documents and traditions, in
    accordance with the Book of Common Prayer. Among orthodox anglicans
    there are a variety of traditions, which (at least in North America
    and Britain) include:
    -   [Evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical") Anglicans: emphasize
        scripture teaching, bible study, and discipleship;
    -   [Charismatic](Charismatic "Charismatic") Anglicans: emphasize
        the ministry of the Holy Spirit and the expression of the
        [gifts of the Spirit](Gifts_of_the_Spirit "Gifts of the Spirit") in
        regular worship;


-   Liturgical Practice - It has been said that Anglicans are
    catholic in sacrament and protestant in theology. While that does
    not capture the breadth of Anglicanism, it reflects an attempt at a
    "via media" (middle way) that has been a hallmark of Anglicanism
    since the English Reformation.
    -   Anglo-Catholic Anglicans: These Anglicans tend to emphasize
        historical rites and liturgical details, often including for
        example plainsong chants, incense, and Elizabethan English. Most
        Anglo-Catholics stress a continuity with the pre-Reformation Church
        of England. Some regard the Thirty-nine Articles as
        non-authoritative because of their negative tone toward such Roman
        beliefs as purgatory. Some Anglo-Catholics promote communion with
        Rome (they are sometimes referred to pejoratively as
        'Anglo-papists').
    -   Low-Church Anglicans: Many evangelical and charismatic
        Anglicans tend to be far less liturgical, although the use of the
        sacraments from the Book of Common Prayer is still standard. These
        Anglicans are less concerned with liturgical rigor and tend to be
        more protestant in outlook.


Anglican Churches in the United States, Canada, and to a lesser
extent Great Britain are currently dominated by liberal bishops. In
response to this, the "continuing Anglican" movement has come
about, wherein many TEC parishes are leaving for more conservative
communions, such as the Reformed Episcopal Church and the Anglican
Catholic Church. The majority of Anglicans however are in the
"Global South" (Africa, Asia, Australia) where orthodoxy is
dominant. There is a small but significant group of orthodox
bishops in the United States, most notably associated with the
Anglican Communion Network led by Bishop Duncan of Pittsburgh.

## Provinces of the Anglican Church

around the world. The largest province is
