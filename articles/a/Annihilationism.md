**Annihilationism** is the belief that the final fate of those who
are not saved is literal and final death and destruction. It runs
counter to the mainstream traditional Christian understanding of
[hell](Hell "Hell") as eternal suffering and separation from
[God](God "God").

In contrast to the more traditional view, which holds that the
wicked will remain conscious in hell forever, annhilationism
teaches that, whether or not God may use hell to exact some
conscious punishment for [sins](Sin "Sin"), he will eventually
destroy or annihilate the wicked completely, leaving only the
righteous to live on in immortality. This is essentially a moot
point for [Universalists](Universalism "Universalism") since in
their view all will be saved and hell will one day be empty.

Each of the three views, Annihilationism, Eternal Torment and
Universalism, has at least one major feature in common with the
alternatives. Universalism and Eternal Torment both affirm that
everyone will have immortality. Universalism and Annihilationism
affirm that evil will one day no longer exist, and Annihilationism
and Eternal Torment both affirm that some will be punished
eternally, without remedy. For the annihilationist, however,
eternal punishment is seen as "permanent elimination."

## Conditional immortality

The [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of Annihilationism is often,
although not always, bound-up with the notion of Conditional
Immortality, a belief that the [soul](Soul "Soul") is not innately
immortal. At death, both the wicked and righteous will pass into
unconsciousness, only to be resurrected at the
[final judgment](Final_judgment "Final judgment"). God, who alone
is immortal, passes on the gift of immortality to the righteous,
who will live forever in [heaven](Heaven "Heaven") or on an idyllic
earth, while the wicked will ultimately face the second death, i.e.
extinction.

Even though it may be logically possible for one to believe in the
natural immortality of the soul in the orthodox sense (rightly
understood), and at the same time affirm that God will annihilate
the wicked, "in actual practice those who teach annihilationism
also teach conditional immortality, and vice versa. This accounts
for the tendency to treat the terms as synonyms." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Presuppositions

While annihilationists claim that they find their position to be
biblical, one common rationale is that divine justice and love make
*eternal suffering* in Hell a morally repugnant idea. Many
annihilationists claim that the idea is an unfair punishment for
finite sins of people. How can this accurately reflect God’s
ultimate victory over suffering and evil, they argue, when it
permanently installs a place of suffering in the final, eternal
order? Likewise, how can the saved live in blissful joy knowing
that some of their loved ones burn forever in hell? With this in
mind, many annihilationists (though certainly not all) claim that
the idea of "eternal suffering in Hell" is a misconception and
perversion of the truth about God's justice and love.

Traditionalists respond that only God is qualified to determine
what is truly just, and raise suspicions that annihilationists may
be succumbing to modern cultural pressures. The argument does go
both ways, however. A common response to the idea of annihilation
is that God is infinitely holy and therefore demands infinite
conscious punishment. Another argument is that preaching
annihilationism will make people less eager to spread the Gospel.
Annihilationists respond that what matters is not what any person
believes the holiness of God demands, because only God is qualified
to determine what is truly just, and that whether or not something
is true is irrelevant of how it affects evangelism, if it is even
conceded that annihilationism dampens missionary zeal in the first
place.^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Main arguments

### The biblical language of destruction

Annihilationist argue that language used in the Bible to describe
the fate of the lost speaks in terms of destruction, death, and
similar terms which imply a *ceasing to exist*. Examples include
Matthew 10:28, where Jesus warns of God's ability to destroy body
and soul in Gehenna, Matt 13:40-42 where Jesus speaks of the
judgement by comparing it to weeds being thrown into a furnace,
Romans 6:23 where Paul says that the wages of sin is death, 2 Peter
2:6, where Peter says that what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah was
an example of what will happen to the lost, and so forth.

### Notions of hell depend on Greek ideas

Annihilationists also claim that traditional notions of hell depend
on Greek ideas of an immortal soul, which have been erroneously
read back into Christian Scripture. Traditionalists find this
irrelevant, pointing to passages in the Bible they claim support
the idea of an immortal soul. Annihilationists reply by denying
that Scripture does teach this, instead pointing to Scripture that
declares immortality itself to be a gift.

William Crockett responds,

There is no doubt that second-century Christian apologists drew
heavily on Greek philosophy, especially on the philosophy of the
Cynics, to support the Christian position. But Fudge makes it sound
as if we have a struggle between Paul, the Hebraic-minded Jew, and
post–New Testament hellenists. In fact, Paul himself was heavily
influenced by hellenism, as was every Jew in Palestine during the
first century. 'In Hellenistic- Roman times,' says Martin Hengel,
'Jerusalem was an 'international city,' in which representatives of
the Diaspora throughout the world met together.' In short, says
Hengel,
'*Palestinian Judaism must be regarded as Hellenistic Judaism*.' We
need to be careful, therefore, not to suggest that the New
Testament writers looked through Jewish Old Testament eyes when in
fact their literature, education, culture, philosophy, and language
were thoroughly permeated with Greek thought... [A]lready in the
first century we know that the Pharisees of which Paul was one—had
absorbed the doctrine of immortality. Josephus comments on the
Pharisees:
They believe that souls have power to survive death and that there
are rewards and punishments under the earth for those who have led
lives of virtue or vice: eternal imprisonment is the lot of evil
souls, while the good souls receive an easy passage to a new life
(*Antiquities* 8.14).
Every soul, they maintain, is imperishable, but the soul of the
good alone passes into another body, while the souls of the wicked
suffer eternal punishment (*War* 2.163).
We cannot say that New Testament writers endorsed the Platonic or
Pharisaic belief in a never-dying soul. If this were the case,
annihilationism as a view would be impossible to maintain because
the soul in every human would simply exist forever, whether in
heaven or in hell. In the New Testament, however, we find the
Hebrew belief in the resurrection of the dead rather than the Greek
immortality of the soul (1 Cor. 15:53-55; cf. Dan. 12:2). The
Pharisees believed in the resurrection as well, but only for the
righteous; yet they still expected the souls of the wicked to be
punished eternally. Their view combined the Greek idea of
immortality with the Hebrew doctrine of resurrection.
The apostles taught that everyone, whether good or evil, would be
resurrected (John 5:29; Acts 24:15; cf. Dan. 12:2); they did not
suggest the soul had some special substance that made it eternal.
Yet it is clear from the New Testament that both the righteous and
the wicked are destined to exist forever even though the precise
nature of the resurrected bodies is not always clear. All things
depend on God for their existence, and it is God who resurrects and
sustains his creatures, some unto life in heaven, and some unto
death inthe place we call hell.^[[3]](#note-2)^
### Cosmic harmony

William Crockett writes,

"If [annihilationism] were not so, say the annihilationists, how
could there be harmony in the cosmos? When God creates a new heaven
and a new earth (Isa. 65:17; Rom. 8:19-23), is it not reasonable to
expect the whole creation to be at peace with God? If somewhere, in
some dark corner of the universe, there are still rebellious or
suffering creatures gnashing their teeth, how can this be
considered harmony?
"This is a reasonable argument, but an argument that better suits
universalism than it does annihilationism. The logic of harmony at
the end of time would suggest that God will gather all his creation
into one big harmonious family, rather than setting up a cosmic
scaffold on the Judgment Day to dispatch masses of people into
oblivion.
"In any case, the problem with this kind of argument is that it
imposes present-day expectations on ancient writers. The
annihilationists suppose that a new heaven and a new earth should
produce harmony, or else the renovation is somehow incomplete. To
annihilationists it seems ludicrous to say that God will renovate
nature, yet still have sinners languishing in hell. But the Jewish
writers of late antiquity do not follow this line of reasoning. It
matters little whether the wicked are destroyed, plunged into hell,
or otherwise shriveled into insignificance. They never suggest that
harmony must come from annihilation as opposed to eternal
suffering. Put bluntly, harmony comes when evil is removed
notwithstanding the method. To them the wicked are hostile
elements, intrusions that mar the landscape of God's renovation.
When judgment finally comes, the wicked are cast aside, and that is
all that matters."^[[4]](#note-3)^
To this, an annihilationist might argue that, philosophy and common
beliefs of the apostle's contemporaries aside, that the scripture
does indicate cosmic harmony, that all things are under God and
that his enemies will be done away with, which does not allow for
the eternal existence, let alone torment, of the wicked. Passages
such as 1 Corinthians 15:24-28 and Ephesians 1:10 are often cited
^[[5]](#note-4)^

## Literalism and symbolism

Much of the debate revolves around terminology and the symbolic
imagery of Revelation. Annihilationists argue that passages that
speak of the unsaved as perishing (John 3:16) or being destroyed
(Matt. 10:28) should be taken literally. Traditionalists argue
these terms do not necessarily include the idea of annihilation or
ceasing to exist. Traditionalists argue that the passages in
Revelation that speak of everlasting torment, even though it is
apocalyptic imagery, should nonetheless be taken literally.
Annihilationists point out that such imagery is, in virtually all
other cases, not literal at all (e.g. the lamb, the beast, the
stars, the candlesticks etc), that symbolic language from the Old
Testament is used (such as when one compares Revelation 14:9-11,
19:3 with Isaiah 34:9-10), and claim that literal interpretations
of the meanings of visions referred to in texts such as Revelation
20:10 lead to serious logical and hermeneutical problems.
^[[6]](#note-5)^

## History of support

The vast majority of Christian writers, from Tertullian to Luther,
generally held to traditional notions of hell. However, the
annihilationist position is not without some historical warrant.
Embryonic forms of conditional immortality can be found in the
writing of [Justin Martyr](Justin_Martyr "Justin Martyr") (d.
165).^[[7]](#note-6)^ [Ignatius](Ignatius "Ignatius") of Antioch
(d. 107) is also supposed to be a conditionalist according to some
conditionalist writers. In his Epistle to the Magnesians, he wrote
"Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He
to reward us according to our works, we should cease to be".
^[[8]](#note-7)^ Some suggest it is also found in the writings of
Arnobius (d. 330).^[[9]](#note-8)^ However, the Second Council of
Constantinople (553) condemned the idea.

In 1520 [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") (1483-1546)
published a defense of 41 of his propositions and cited the pope's
immortality declaration as among "those monstrous opinions to be
found in the Roman dunghill of decretals." The 27th Proposition
reads,

> *"However, I permit the Pope establish articles of faith for himself and for his own faithful - such are: a) That the bread and wine are transubstantiated in the sacrament; b) that the essence of God neither generates nor is generated; c) that the soul is the substantial form of the human body; d) that he (the pope) is emperor of the world and king of heaven, and earthly god; e) that the soul is immortal; and all these endless monstrosities in the Roman dunghill of decretals - in order that such as his faith is, such may be his gospel, such also his faithful, and such his church, and that the lips may have suitable lettuce and the lid may be worthy of the dish."*
> ^[[10]](#note-9)^

## Annihilationism today

Today many traditionalists claim that the doctrine is most often
associated with groups descended from William Miller and the
Adventist movement of the mid-1800s, including
[Seventh-day Adventists](Seventh_Day_Adventism "Seventh Day Adventism"),
[Jehovah's Witnesses](Jehovah's_Witnesses "Jehovah's Witnesses"),
and other Adventist groups. However, a number of evangelical
theologians, including Anglican
[John Stott](John_Stott "John Stott"), Church of Christ elder
[Edward Fudge](index.php?title=Edward_Fudge&action=edit&redlink=1 "Edward Fudge (page does not exist)"),
[Open Theists](Open_theism "Open theism")
[Clark Pinnock](Clark_Pinnock "Clark Pinnock") and
[John Sanders](John_Sanders "John Sanders"), as well as Philip
Edgecombe Hughes and others have offered support for the doctrine,
touching off a heated debate within mainstream evangelical
Christianity.

Since the 1960s, Annihilationism seems to be gaining as a
legitimate minority opinion within modern, conservative Protestant
theology. It has found support and acceptance among some British
evangelicals, although viewed with greater suspicion by their
American counterparts.
