***Anno Domini Nostri Iesu Christi*** ("In the Year of Our Lord
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ")"), commonly shortened
to ***Anno Domini*** ("In the Year of the Lord"), abbreviated as
**AD** or **A.D.**, is the designation used to number years in the
**Christian Era**, conventionally used with the
[Julian](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar) and
[Gregorian](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar)
calendars. It defines an epoch based on the traditionally-reckoned
year of the birth of [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ").
**BC** (Before Christ) is used to denote years before Anno Domini
years in English.

## Breakdown of Christian Era Terminology

-   **AD or (A.D.)** (*anno Domini*) — the Latin phrase meaning
    *in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ*, the abbreviation **AD** is
    formally placed before a year of the Christian era (i.e.
    ***AD 1999***), but can also be placed after a year (i.e.
    ***2006 AD***).

-   **BC or (B.C.)** (*before Christ*) — the abbreviation **BC** is
    placed after a year that precedes the Christian era (i.e.
    ***90 BC***). Original Latin term "***Ante Christum Natum***"
    (*aCn*) is not usually preferred in the English language.

-   **CE or (C.E.)** (*common era*) — the religion-neutral
    alternative to ***Anno Domini*** placed after a year of the
    Christian/common era (i.e. ***2001 CE***). See Wikipedia article on
    [Common Era](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era "wikipedia:Common Era")
    for more details.

-   **BCE or (B.C.E.)** (*before common era*) — the
    religion-neutral alternative to ***Before Christ***. This term,
    created in conjunction with the ***Common Era*** (*CE*)
    designation, is formally placed after a years prior to the
    Christian/current era (i.e. ***400 BCE***).
