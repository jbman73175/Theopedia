May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant
brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of
the sheep, equip you with everything good for doing his will, and
may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to
whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. (Hebrews 13:20-21)
