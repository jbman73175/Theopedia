Statue at Canterbury Cathedral
**Anselm of Canterbury** (1033–1109) was a
[Scholastic](Scholasticism "Scholasticism") philosopher and
clergyman, born in Aosta, NW Italy. He left Italy in 1056 and
settled at the Benedictine abbey of Bec in Normandy. He moved to
England to succeed Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1093.
His strong principles brought him into conflict both with William
II and Henry I in England, and he was temporarily exiled by each of
them. Greatly influenced by [Augustine](Augustine "Augustine"),
Anselm sought ‘necessary reasons’ for religious beliefs, notably
the famous
[ontological argument](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God#Ontological_Argument "Arguments for the existence of God")
for the existence of [God](God "God").^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Biographical sketch

Anselm was born in the city of Aosta in the Kingdom of Burgundy.
Aosta is located in the Italian Alps region of Valle d'Aosta (Aosta
Valley), near the borders with twentieth century France and
Switzerland. His family was accounted noble, and was possessed of
considerable property. Gundulph, his father, was by birth a
Lombard, and seems to have been a man of harsh and violent temper;
his mother, Ermenberga, was a prudent and virtuous woman, from
whose careful religious training the young Anselm derived much
benefit. At the age of fifteen he desired to enter a convent, but
he could not obtain his father's consent. Disappointment brought on
an illness, on his recovery from which he seems for a time to have
given up his studies, and to have plunged into the gay life of the
world. During this time his mother died, and his father's harshness
became unbearable. In 1059 he left home, and with only one
attendant crossed the Alps, and wandered through Burgundy and
France. Attracted by the fame of his countryman, Lanfranc, then
Prior of the Benedictine Abbey of Bec, he entered Normandy. The
following year, after spending some time at Avranches, he entrered
the abbey as a novice at the age of twenty-seven.

### His years as abbot of Bec

Three years later, in 1063, when Lanfranc was made the abbot of
Caen, Anselm was elected Prior. This office he held for fifteen
years, and then, in 1078, on the death of the warrior monk Herluin,
founder and first abbot of Bec, Anselm was elected abbot. Under his
jurisdiction, Bec became the first seat of learning in Europe,
although Anselm appears to have been less interested in attracting
external students to it. It was during these quiet years at Bec
that Anselm wrote his first philosophical works, the *Monologion*
and *Proslogion.* These were followed by *The Dialogues on Truth*,
*Free Will*, and the *Fall of the Devil*.

Meanwhile the convent had been growing in wealth, as well as in
reputation, and had acquired considerable property in England,
which it became the duty of Anselm occasionally to visit.

### His move to England and the archbishopric of Canterbury

By his mildness of temper and unswerving rectitude, he so endeared
himself to the English that he was looked upon and desired as the
natural successor to Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury. But on
the death of that great man, the ruling sovereign, William II,
seized the possessions and revenues of the see, and made no new
appointment.

About four years after, in 1092, on the invitation of Hugh, earl of
Chester, Anselm with some reluctance, for he feared to be made
archbishop, crossed to England. He was detained by business for
nearly four months, and when about to return, was refused
permission by the king. In the following year William fell ill, and
thought his death was at hand. Eager to make atonement for his sin
with regard to the archbishopric, he nominated Anselm to the vacant
see, and after a great struggle compelled him to accept the
pastoral staff of office. After obtaining dispensation from his
duties in Normandy, Anselm was consecrated in 1093.

He died on April 21 1109. He was canonized in the Roman Catholic
Church in 1494 by Alexander VI and named a Doctor of the Church in
1720 by Pope Clement XI.

## Writings

Anselm may, with some justice, be considered the first scholarly
philosopher of Christian theology. His only great predecessor,
Scotus Erigena, had more of the speculative and mystical element
than is consistent with a schoolman. In Anselm, by contrast, one
finds the special characteristics of scholastic theological
thought: a recognition of the relationship of reason to revealed
truth, and an attempt to elaborate a rational system of faith.

### Foundation

Anselm's constant endeavor was to render the contents of the
Christian consciousness clear to reason, and to develop the
intelligible truths interwoven with the Christian belief. The
necessary preliminary for this is the possession of the Christian
consciousness. As Anselm wrote: "Nor do I seek to understand that I
may believe, but I believe that I may understand. For this too I
believe, that unless I first believe, I shall not understand." But
after the faith is held fast, the attempt must be made to
demonstrate by reason the truth of what we believe. Indeed, it is
wrong not to do so: "I hold it to be a failure in duty if after we
have become steadfast in our faith we do not strive to understand
what we believe."

The groundwork of Anselm's theory of knowledge is contained in the
tract *De Veritate*, in which, from the consideration of truth as
in knowledge, in willing, and in things, he rises to the
affirmation of an absolute truth, in which all other truth
participates. This absolute truth is God himself, who is therefore
the ultimate ground or principle both of things and of thought. The
notion of God comes thus into the foreground of the system; before
all things it is necessary that it should be made clear to reason,
that it should be demonstrated to have real existence.

### Proofs

This demonstration is the substance of his works *Monologion* and
*Proslogion*. In the first of these the proof rests on the ordinary
grounds of realism, and coincides to some extent with the earlier
theory of [Augustine](Augustine "Augustine"), though it is carried
out with singular boldness and fulness. Things, he says, are called
good in a variety of ways and degrees; this would be impossible if
there were not some absolute standard, some good in itself, in
which all relative goods participate. Similarly with such
predicates as great, just; they involve a certain greatness and
justice. The very existence of things is impossible without some
one Being, by whom they come to exist. This absolute Being, this
goodness, justice, greatness, is God.

Anselm was not thoroughly satisfied with this reasoning; it started
from a posteriori grounds, and contained several converging lines
of proof. He desired to have some one short demonstration. Such a
demonstration he presented in his Proslogion; this is his
celebrated proof of the existence of God, sometimes referred to
anachronistically as the
[ontological](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God "Arguments for the existence of God")
proof - a term first applied to the arguments of 17th and 18th
century rationalists by Kant.

Anselm's argument proceeds to demonstrate the existence of God as
follows: I can think that than which a greater cannot be thought.
Now, if that than which a greater cannot be thought existed only in
the intellect, it would not be that than which a greater cannot be
thought, since it can be thought to exist in reality which is
greater. It follows, then, that that than which a greater cannot be
thought exists in reality. The bulk of the Proslogion is taken up
with Anselm's attempt to establish the identity of that than which
a greater cannot be thought with God, and thus to establish that
God exists in reality.

Anselm's reasoning has been the subject of controversy since he
first 'published' it in the 1070s. It was opposed at the time by
the monk Gaunilo, in his *Liber pro Insipiente*, on the ground that
we cannot pass from idea to reality. The same criticism is made by
several of the later schoolmen, among others by Aquinas, and is in
substance what Kant advances against all ontological proof. It
should be noted that there is no evidence that either Aquinas or
Kant read the *Proslogion*. Anselm replied to the objections of his
contemporary, Gaunilo, in his *Responsio*.

Anselm also authored a number of other
[arguments for the existence of God](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God "Arguments for the existence of God"),
based on cosmological and teleological grounds.

### Further works

The existence of God being thus held proved, Anselm proceeded to
state the rational grounds of the Christian doctrines of
[creation](Creation "Creation") and of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"). With reference to the Trinity, he
says we cannot know God from himself, but only after the analogy of
his creatures. The special analogy used is the self-consciousness
of man. The peculiar double nature of consciousness, memory and
intelligence, represent the relation of the Father to the Son. The
mutual love of these two, proceeding from the relation they hold to
one another, symbolizes the Holy Spirit. The further theological
doctrines of man, such as original sin and free will, are developed
in the Monologion and other mixed treatises.

Finally, in Anselm's greatest work, *Cur Deus Homo* ("Why did God
become Man?"), he undertook to make plain, even to infidels, the
rational necessity of the Christian mystery of the atonement. The
theory rests on three positions: that satisfaction is necessary on
account of God's honor and justice; that such satisfaction can be
given only by the peculiar personality of the God-man Jesus; that
such satisfaction is really given by the voluntary death of this
infinitely valuable person. The demonstration is, in brief, this.
All the actions of men are due to the furtherance of God's glory;
if, then, there be sin, i.e. if God's honour be wounded, man of
himself can give no satisfaction. But the justice of God demands
satisfaction; and as an insult to infinite honour is in itself
infinite, the satisfaction must be infinite, i.e. it must outweigh
all that is not God. Such a penalty can only be paid by God
himself, and, as a penalty for man, must be paid under the form of
man. Satisfaction is only possible through the God-man. Now this
God-man, as sinless, is exempt from the punishment of sin; His
passion is therefore voluntary, not given as due. The merit of it
is therefore infinite; God's justice is thus appeased, and His
mercy may extend to man. This theory has exercised immense
influence on church doctrine, providing the basis for the Roman
Catholic concept of the treasury of merit. It is certainly an
advance on the older patristic theory, in so far as it substitutes
for a contest between God and Satan, a contest between the goodness
and justice of God. However, it can be said that Anselm puts the
whole issue on a merely legal footing, giving it no ethical
bearing, and neglects altogether the consciousness of the
individual to be redeemed. In this respect it contrasts unfavorably
with the later
[moral influence theory](index.php?title=Moral_influence_theory&action=edit&redlink=1 "Moral influence theory (page does not exist)")
of Peter Abélard.
