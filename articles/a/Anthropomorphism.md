**Anthropomorphism**, also referred to as personification or
prosopopeia, is the attribution of human characteristics to
inanimate objects, animals, forces of nature, and others.
[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism)
[Biblical](Bible "Bible") anthropomorphism is when human
characteristics are projected on [God](God "God").

The Bible has examples of God referring to himself in
anthropomorphic terms and the biblical writers referring to God in
anthropomorphic terms -- the purpose being to describe God in terms
more understandable to humans. Without anthropomorphism, since
[God](God "God") is invisible and
[immaterial](Immateriality_of_God "Immateriality of God"), we would
not have a framework on which to understand Him.

## Anthropomorphism in the Bible

Examples of anthropomorphism can be seen in the following
passages:

**Exodus 3:20** "So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt
with all My miracles which I shall do in the midst of it; and after
that he will let you go.

**Exodus 32:14** So the LORD changed His mind about the harm which
He said He would do to His people.

**Isaiah 38:1-5** In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him,
"Thus says the LORD, 'Set your house in order, for you shall die
and not live.'" Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and
prayed to the LORD, and said, "Remember now, O LORD, I beseech You,
how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart, and
have done what is good in Your sight." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying, "Go and say to
Hezekiah, 'Thus says the LORD, the God of your father David, "I
have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will add
fifteen years to your life.

## The danger of incorrectly interpreting anthropomorphic verses

Many theologies have arisen out of literally interpreting
anthropomorphic verses in the Bible; once such notable theology is
[Open Theism](Open_Theism "Open Theism"). This theology takes
verses where God seemingly changes His mind
([Numbers 16:20–35](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2016:20-35;&version=49;)),
and grieves
([Genesis 6:5–6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/index.php?search=genesis%206:5-6&version=49))
to be literal statements.

Audius and his followers, the Audians, were a sect of Christians
that arose in the fourth century in Syria and extended into
Scythia. They took the text of Genesis 1:27 literally, saying that
[God](God "God") has a human form. The error was so gross, and, to
use [Jerome's](Jerome "Jerome") expression (Epist. vi, Ad
Pammachium), so absolutely senseless, that it showed no vitality.

## Literal vs. figurative anthropomorphism

It is important to establish what texts in the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") may be taken literally and what verses we
must take figuratively.

**Literal**  
Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no
one comes to the Father but through Me. "If you had known Me, you
would have known My Father also; from now on you know Him, and have
seen Him."  
**John 14:6-7**

**Figurative**  
So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat
the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life
in yourselves. "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has
eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. "For My
flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. "He who eats My
flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.  
**John 6:53-56**

The previous verse shows errors of incorrectly interpreting
[Biblical](Bible "Bible") anthropomorphism in those that advocate
[transubstantiation](Transubstantiation "Transubstantiation").
