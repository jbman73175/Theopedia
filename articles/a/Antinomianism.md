**Antinomianism** comes from the Greek meaning *lawless*. In
Christian theology it is a pejorative term for the teaching that
Christians are under no obligation to obey the laws of
[ethics](Ethics "Ethics") or morality. Few, if any, would
explicitly call themselves "antinomian," hence, it is usually a
charge leveled by one group against an opposing group.

Antinomianism may be viewed as the polar opposite of
[legalism](Legalism "Legalism"), the notion that obedience to a
code of religious law is necessary for
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation"). In this sense, both
antinomianism and legalism are considered errant extremes.

## Antinomianism in the New Testament

[Paul](Paul "Paul"), in his letters, mentions several times that we
are saved by the unearned grace of God, not by our own good works,
"lest anyone should boast." He used the term *freedom in Christ*,
for example
[Galatians](Epistle_to_the_Galatians "Epistle to the Galatians")
2:4, and it is clear that some understood this to mean lawlessness,
for example [Acts](Acts_of_the_Apostles "Acts of the Apostles")
21:21 records [James](James "James") explaining his situation to
Paul:

"...they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who
are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to
circumcise their children or walk according to our customs."
The early history of Christianity records conflict between "Pauline
Christianity" and the Jerusalem Church led by James the Just,
[Simon Peter](Peter "Peter"), and [John](John "John"), the
so-called "Jewish Christians." In Galatians 2:14, part of the
"Incident at Antioch," Paul publicly accused Peter of judaizing,
perhaps [legalism](Legalism "Legalism"). He goes on to say that
sins remain sins, and condemns by several examples the kind of
behaviour that the [church](Church "Church") should not tolerate.
This confusion is most likely the cause of the statement in
[2 Peter](Second_Epistle_of_Peter "Second Epistle of Peter") 3.16
that some of Paul's Letters are hard to understand, "which the
ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do
the other Scriptures" (2 Peter 3:16b).

The [Epistle of James](Epistle_of_James "Epistle of James"), in
contrast, states that our good works
[justify](Justification "Justification") before men our faith after
salvation and we are to obey the Law of God, that faith without
works is death (2:14-26).

According to the
[Sermon on the Mount](Sermon_on_the_Mount "Sermon on the Mount"),
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") taught:

"Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. Not everyone who
says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the
one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day
many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name,
and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your
name?' And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart
from me, you workers of lawlessness.'" Matthew 7:20-23
According to the
[Sermon on the Plain](index.php?title=Sermon_on_the_Plain&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sermon on the Plain (page does not exist)"),
Jesus taught:

"The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces
good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil,
for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks. Why do you
call me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do what I tell you?" Luke 6:45-46
## Antinomianism among Christians

In the case of Christianity, the controversy arises out of the
doctrine of [grace](Grace "Grace"), the forgiveness of
[sins](Sin "Sin") and [atonement](Atonement "Atonement") by
[faith](Faith "Faith") in Jesus Christ. If God forgives sins, what
exactly is the disadvantage in sinning, or the reward of
obedience?

There are several issues that are addressed by the charge of
antinomianism. The charge may represent the fear that a given
theological position does not lead to the edification of the
believer or assist him in leading a regenerate life. Doctrines that
tend to erode the authority of the [church](Church "Church") and
its right to prescribe religious practices for the faithful are
often condemned as antinomian. The charge is also brought against
those whose teachings are perceived as hostile to government and
established authority.

The first people accused of antinomianism were found, apparently,
in [Gnosticism](Gnosticism "Gnosticism"); various aberrant and
licentious acts were ascribed to these by their
[orthodox](Orthodox "Orthodox") enemies; we have few independent
records of their actual teachings. In the
[Book of Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation")
2:6-15, the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") speaks
of Nicolaitans, who are traditionally identified with a Gnostic
sect, in terms that suggest the charge of antinomianism might be
appropriate.

[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism") tends to
charge [Protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism") with
antinomianism, based in part on the distinctively Protestant
doctrine of *[sola fide](Sola_fide "Sola fide")*,
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") by faith alone, and the typical
Protestant rejection of the elaborate sacramental
[liturgy](Liturgy "Liturgy") of the Roman church, and its body of
canon law. Within Roman Catholicism itself,
[Blaise Pascal](Blaise_Pascal "Blaise Pascal") accused the
[Jesuits](Jesuits "Jesuits") of antinomianism in his
*Lettres provinciales*, charging that Jesuit casuistry undermined
moral principles. Charges of antinomianism have also been bandied
about within the Protestant camp as well;
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") accused Johannes
Agricola of antinomianism and rejecting the notion of a moral law;
other Protestant groups that have been so accused include the
[Anabaptists](Anabaptist "Anabaptist") and
[Mennonites](Mennonite "Mennonite").
[Calvinists](Calvinism "Calvinism") have also drawn charges of
antinomianism. In the history of American
[Puritanism](Puritanism "Puritanism"), Roger Williams was accused
of antinomian teachings by the Puritan leadership of New England.

Theological charges of antinomianism typically imply that the
opponent's doctrine leads to various sorts of licentiousness, and
imply that the antinomian chooses his theology in order to further
a career of dissipation. The conspicuous austerity of life among
surviving groups of Anabaptists or Calvinists suggests that these
accusations are mostly for rhetorical effect.
