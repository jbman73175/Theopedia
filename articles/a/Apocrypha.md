**Apocrypha** is the word most commonly used in reference to texts
considered by [Protestants](Protestantism "Protestantism") to be
non-[canonical](Development_of_the_canon "Development of the canon")
and not legitimately part of the [Bible](Bible "Bible"); however,
they are included in some protestant Bibles between the O.T and
N.T. and labelled Apocrypha. These writings are however considered
canonical and included as part of the O.T. Scriptures in
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") and
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox") Bibles.

Disagreement between Christian Churches is almost non-existent
about the canon of the New Testament, but the inclusion of some
books in the Old Testament canon is disputed.

Although the apocryphal books may be of roughly similar style and
age as the accepted
[canonical](Development_of_the_canon "Development of the canon")
Scriptures, many of which were included in versions of the early
Greek Old Testament (the [Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint")),
these Jewish writings are not part of the Hebrew Bible (the
[Masoretic text](Masoretic_text "Masoretic text")). Since these
books were primarily written in the intermediate time between the
Old and New Testaments, Protestant scholars sometimes call them
"intertestamental" writings, and view them as no different from
other historical writings.

Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox consider these texts equally
canonical as books of the Bible, with Catholics terming them
*deuterocanonical* (from Greek: *second canon*). This is primarily
based on their inclusion in the Septuagint and the fact that many
of the
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers")
frequently quoted from them. The Vulgate was basically a Latin
translation of the Septuagint.

The [Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England")
takes an intermediate position on the Apocrypha; its Sixth Article
of Religion says of them "the Church doth read for example of life
and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to
establish any [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine")".
