**Apollinarianism** is a [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") maintaining that
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") was not a real man, but
not totally divine either. Apollinarians suggested that he had a
human body and a human soul, but his mind was taken over by the
eternal Logos. The heretical belief is named for Apollinaris of
Laodicea (ca. 350).
