**Apollyon**, a-pol'-i-on (Apolluon; 'abhaddon, "destroyer"):
Present participle of the verb apolluo, "to destroy."   
**I. Definition.** A proper name, original with the author of the
Apocalypse and used by him once (Re 9:11) as a translation of the
Hebrew word "Abaddon" (see [Abaddon](Abaddon "Abaddon")) to
designate an angel or prince of the lower world.   
**II. Old Testament Background.**   
1. Fundamental Meaning: The term Abaddon ("destruction") appears
solely in the Wisdom literature of the Old Testament and in the
following narrow range of instances: Job 26:6; 28:22; 31:12; Ps
88:11; Pr 15:11. In all these passages save one (Job 31:12) the
word is combined either with Sheol, "death," or "the grave," in
such a way as to indicate a purely eschatological term based upon
the advanced idea of moral distinctions in the realm of the dead.
In the one exceptional passage (Es 8:6 is incorrectly referred
to--the word here is different, namely, 'abhedhan) where the
combination does not occur, the emphasis upon the moral element in
the "destruction" mentioned is so definite as practically to
preclude the possibility of interpreting the term in any general
sense (as Charles, HDB, article "Abaddon"; per con., Briggs, ICC,
"Psalms" in the place cited.; BDB, sub loc.). The meaning of the
word, therefore, is: the place or condition of utter ruin reserved
for the wicked in the realm of the dead.  
2. Personification: One other feature of Old Testament usage is
worthy of consideration as throwing light upon Re 9:11. Abaddon and
the accompanying terms "Death" and Sheol are personified (as in Job
28:22) and represented as living beings who speak and act (compare
Re 6:8).  
**III. New Testament Usage.**  
1. The Starting-Point: The starting-point of the Apocalyptist's use
of "Apollyon" is to be found in the fundamental meaning of
"Abaddon" as moral destruction in the underworld, together with the
occasional personification of kindred terms in the Old Testament.
The imagery was in general terms familiar while the New Testament
writer felt perfectly free to vary the usage to suit his own
particular purposes.   
2. Apollyon not Satan but Part of an Ideal Description: (1) Since
Apollyon is a personification he is not to be identified with Satan
(compare Re 9:1 where Satan seems to be clearly indicated) or with
any other being to whom historical existence and definite
characteristics are ascribed. He is the central figure in an ideal
picture of evil forces represented as originating in the world of
lost spirits and allowed to operate destructively in human life.
They are pictured as locusts, but on an enlarged scale and with the
addition of many features inconsistent with the strict application
of the figure (see Re 9:7-10). The intention is, by the
multiplication of images which the author does not attempt to
harmonize, to convey the impression of great power and far-reaching
destructiveness. (2) This interpretation finds additional support
in the writer's significant departure from the familiar usage. In
the Old Testament the place of destruction is personified--in Re
9:11, personal forces issue from the Abyss, of which the presiding
genius is Destruction in person. The seer's picture is equally
independent of the tradition represented by the Talmud (Shab f. 55)
where Abaddon is personified as jointly with Death president over
six destroying angels. These modifications are evidently due to the
exigencies of the pictorial form. It is clearly impossible to
portray forces proceeding from the place of ruin in the charge of
the place itself.   
3. Apollyon Necessary to the Picture: The importance of the
conception of Apollyon to the completeness of the picture should
not be overlooked. It is intended to represent these forces as
having a certain principle of internal unity and as possessors of
the power of effective leadership. 4. General Significance of the
Description: As to the specific significance of the vision of the
locusts as a whole it is not easy to reach a conclusion. Professor
Swete suggests (Commentary on Apocalypse in the place cited.) that
"the locusts of the abyss may be the memories of the past brought
home at times of divine visitation; they hurt by recalling
forgotten sins." It seems to us more probable that it represents an
actual historical movement, past or to come, demoniacal in origin
and character, human in the mode of its operation and the sphere of
its influence, used by God for a scourge upon mankind and kept in
restraint by His grace and power. See
