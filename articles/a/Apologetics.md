**Apologetics** is the verbal defense of
[the Faith](Christianity "Christianity"), for example by dispelling
inaccurate stereotypes or by re-presenting
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") in language that is more accessible
to non-believers. The goal of apologetics is to persuasively answer
honest objections that keep people from faith in
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"). ^[[1]](#note-0)^

Scripture encourages each believer to be an apologist:

[But] in your hearts regard Christ the Lord as holy,
**always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you**;
yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience, so
that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior
in Christ may be put to shame. (1 Peter 3:15-16)
Apologetics may be contrasted with [polemics](Polemics "Polemics")
which refers to the practice of challenging and refuting doctrinal
errors within the same belief system (or religion). Apologetics,
therefore, may be viewed as dialogue to defend Christianity to
non-Christians and polemics as dialogue *internal* to Christianity
to refute error or provide correctives.

There are many different ways to approach apologetics, most of
which are outlined below.

## Methods

### Classical

"The classical method is an approach that begins by employing
[natural theology](Natural_theology "Natural theology") to
establish theism as the correct worldview. After
[God's existence](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God "Arguments for the existence of God")
has thus been shown, the classical method moves to a presentation
of the historical evidences for the deity of Christ, the
trustworthiness of the Scripture, etc., to show that Christianity
is the best version of theism, as opposed to, say, Judaism or
Islam. This school is called the *classical* method because it is
assumed that this is the method used by the most prominent
apologists of earlier centuries."^[[2]](#note-1)^

Contemporary classical apologetic works include
[William Lane Craig](William_Lane_Craig "William Lane Craig"),
*Reasonable Faith*; [R. C. Sproul](R._C._Sproul "R. C. Sproul"),
*Classical Apologetics*;
[Norman Geisler](Norman_Geisler "Norman Geisler"),
*When Skeptics Ask*;
[Stephen T. Davis](index.php?title=Stephen_T._Davis&action=edit&redlink=1 "Stephen T. Davis (page does not exist)"),
*God, Reason, and Theistic Proofs*; and
[Richard Swinburne](Richard_Swinburne "Richard Swinburne").

### Evidential

"The evidential method has much in common with the classical method
except in solving the issue concerning the value of miracles as
evidence. Evidentialism as a apologetic method may be characterized
as the *one-step* approach. Miracles do not presuppose God's
existence (as most contemporary classical apologists assert) but
can serve as one sort of evidence for God. This method is fairly
eclectic in its use of various positive evidences and negative
critiques, utilizing both philosophical and historical arguments.
Yet it tends to focus chiefly on the legitimacy of accumulating
various historical and other inductive arguments for the truth of
Christianity." ^[[3]](#note-2)^ Proponents of this school include:
Gary Habermas, *In Defense of Miracles* and John Warwick
Montgomery, *Evidence For Faith: Deciding the God Question*.

### Cumulative case

"The term *cumulative case* is used by apologists in ways different
than we are using it in this context, but Basil Mitchell, an early
proponent of this view, gave this method that name, and so will wil
use it here. The careful reader will no doubt note that this method
belongs to the same broad family of methods as does the evidential
(and perhaps classical) method. However, it will also be apparent
that as an argumentative strategy, the cumulative case method has
something distinctive to offer. Indeed, this approach to
apologetics arose because of the dissatisfaction that some
philosophers had with these other evidential-type methods (i.e.,
the first two of the Big Four)." ^[[4]](#note-3)^

### Presuppositional

"Due to the
[noetic effects of sin](Noetic_effects_of_sin "Noetic effects of sin")^[[5]](#note-4)^,
presuppositionalists usually hold that there is not enough common
ground between believers and unbelievers that would allow followers
of the prior three methods to accomplish their goals. The apologist
must simply presuppose the truth of Christianity as the proper
starting point in apologetics. Here the Christian revelation in the
Scriptures is the framework through which all experience is
interpreted and all truth is known. Various evidences and arguments
can be advanced for the truth of Christianity, but these at least
implicitly presuppose premises that can be true only if
Christianity is true. Presuppositionalist attempt, then, to argue
transcendentally. That is, they argue that all meaning and thought
- indeed, every fact - logically presupposes the God of the
Scriptures." ^[[6]](#note-5)^

*See main page on [presuppositional apologetics](Presuppositional_apologetics "Presuppositional apologetics").*

### Reformed epistemology

"*Since the Enlightenment,* Clark says,
*there has been a demand to expose all of our beliefs to the searching criticism of reason.*
(...). We are told that if a belief is unsupported by evidence of
some kind, it is irrational to believe it. Reformed epistemology
challenges this *evidentialist* epistemological assumption. Those
who advocate this view hold that it is perfectly reasonable for a
person to believe many things without evidence. Most strikingly,
they argue that belief in God does not require the support of
evidence or argument in order for it to be rational. The Reformed
epistemology apologist will not necessarily eschew making positive
arguments in defense of Christianity, but will argue that such
arguments are not necessary for rational faith. If Calvin is right
that human beings are born with an innate
[sensus divinitatis](index.php?title=Sensus_divinitatis&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sensus divinitatis (page does not exist)")
(sense of the divine), then people may rightly and rationally come
to have a belief in God immediately without the aid of evidence."
^[[7]](#note-6)^ Proponents of this view would include Kelly James
Clark, [Alvin Plantinga](Alvin_Plantinga "Alvin Plantinga"),
[Nicholas Wolterstorff](index.php?title=Nicholas_Wolterstorff&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nicholas Wolterstorff (page does not exist)"),
George Mavrodes, and William Alson.
