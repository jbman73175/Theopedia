The word **apostle** (Greek *apostolos*) is a common term for
someone *sent forth* or *sent out*, as an emissary. In the formal
Christian sense, it is the title attributed to the **Apostles** of
Jesus Christ. As the Bible says, "And when day came, he called his
disciples and chose from them twelve, whom he named *apostles*"
(Luke 6:13, ESV). Probably Galilean Jewish men (10 names are
Aramaic, 4 names are Greek) chosen from among the disciples, they
were "sent forth" by Jesus to be his special witnesses in spreading
the [gospel](Gospel "Gospel").

**Irenaeus**  
If anyone does not agree with [the apostles' teaching,] he despises
the companions of the Lord, he despises Christ the Lord himself, he
even despises the Father, and he is self-condemned, resisting and
refusing his own salvation, as all the heretics do.^[[1]](#note-0)^

## The twelve Apostles

According to the
[Gospel of Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew")
(10:1-4), the [Gospel of Mark](Gospel_of_Mark "Gospel of Mark")
(3:13-19), and the
[Gospel according to Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke")
(6:12-16), the "twelve" chosen by Jesus near the beginning of his
ministry, those "whom he named Apostles", were:

-   **[Simon Peter](Peter "Peter")**, also known as Simon
    bar-Jonah, named Cephas (Aram.) by Jesus, a fisherman from
    Bethsaida "of Galilee" (John 1:44; cf. John 12:21).
-   **Andrew**, brother of Peter, a Bethsaida fisherman and
    disciple of John the Baptist.
-   **[John](John "John")**, son of Zebedee, self-identified as the
    "disciple whom Jesus loved."
-   **[James](James,_son_of_Zebedee "James, son of Zebedee")**,
    together with his brother John called Boanerges (an Aramaic name
    explained in Mark 3:17 as "Sons of Thunder") by Jesus.
-   **[Philip](Philip_the_apostle "Philip the apostle")**, from
    Bethsaida "of Galilee" (John 1:44, John 12:21).
-   **Bartholomew**, in Aramaic "bar-Tolemai" (i.e. "son of
    Tolemai" or "from Ptolemais"), usually identified with Nathanael.
-   **[Matthew](Matthew_(Apostle) "Matthew (Apostle)")**, the tax
    collector, sometimes identified with Levi, son of Alphaeus.
-   **Thomas**, also known as Judas Thomas Didymus, Aramaic T'oma',
    "twin", Greek Didymous, "twin".
-   **[James, son of Alphaeus](James,_son_of_Alphaeus "James, son of Alphaeus")**
-   **Simon**, a Canaanite, called in Luke and Acts "Simon the
    Zealot" .
-   **Thaddaeus**, in some manuscripts of Matthew "Lebbaeus" or
    "Judas the Zealot" and in Luke Judas, son of James.
-   **[Judas Iscariot](Judas_Iscariot "Judas Iscariot")**, "the
    traitor"; name Iscariot may refer to the Judaean towns of Kerioth
    or to the sicarii, Jewish nationalist insurrectionists.

## Matthias, Apostle 13?

In [Acts 1](Acts_1 "Acts 1"), **Matthias** is chosen to replace
**Judas Iscariot** who had committed suicide. Peter calls for the
election of a replacement and two men are nominated. Matthias is
chosen after casting lots, but is never heard from again in Holy
Scripture.

There is some question as to the method of how Matthias was picked.
Some have taken his lack of further appearances as proof that the
disciples chose him in a wrong manner and that Paul was intended to
be the Apostle who recompleted the circle. Others cite the
Apostle's prayer in
[Acts 1:24](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Acts_1:24&action=edit&redlink=1 "Acts 1:24 (page does not exist)")
as a model for godliness in choosing Office Bearers.

## Saul who became Paul

In his writings, Saul, later known as [Paul](Paul "Paul"), though
not one of the Twelve, described himself as an apostle, one
"untimely born" (e.g. Romans 1:1 and other letters), claimed he was
appointed by the resurrected Jesus himself during his road to
Damascus vision; specifically he referred to himself as the
**Apostle to the Gentiles** (Romans 11:13).

Since Paul claimed to have received the [Gospel](Gospel "Gospel")
through a [revelation](Revelation "Revelation") of
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") (cf. Gal 1:12; Acts
9:3-19, 26-27) after Christ's death and resurrection (rather than
knowing Christ before his resurrection like the Twelve had), he was
often obliged to defend his apostolic authority and proclaim that
he had seen and was anointed by Jesus while on the road to
Damascus; but James, Peter and John in Jerusalem accepted his
apostleship to the [Gentiles](Gentile "Gentile") as of equal
authority as Peter's ministry to the Jews according to Paul
([Galatians](Epistle_to_the_Galatians "Epistle to the Galatians")
2:7-9).

## The Office of the Apostle

There has been a move to diffentiate what some call 'The Office of
the Apostle' and apostlic leadership. The reasoning for this is
found in Ephesians 4:11 where Paul lists five "leadership styles,"
and of those one is being an apostle. The category includes all
those Jesus named along with those who saw the risen Christ and
wrote
scripture.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
Some see Acts 13:2 as effectively naming Barnabas as an Apostle
other than the twelve.
