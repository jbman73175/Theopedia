## History

The **Apostles' Creed** is an early statement of Christian belief,
possibly from the first or second century, but in its current form
more likely post-[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") in the
early 4th Century AD. The theological specifics of the creed appear
to be a refutation of the early heresy of
[Gnosticism](Gnosticism "Gnosticism"). The Apostles' Creed is
widely used by a number of Christian denominations for both
liturgical and catechetical purposes, most visibly by liturgical
churches of western tradition, including
[Lutheran](Lutheranism "Lutheranism") churches,
[Anglican](Anglican "Anglican") and
[Episcopalian](Episcopalian "Episcopalian") churches and
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") churches.

## Text of the creed

I believe in God, the Father Almighty,  
   the Creator of heaven and earth,  
   and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:

Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit,  
   born of the Virgin Mary,  
   suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
   was crucified, died, and was buried.

He descended into hell.

The third day He arose again from the dead.

He ascended into heaven  
   and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty,  
   whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church,  
   the communion of saints,  
   the forgiveness of sins,  
   the resurrection of the body,  
   and life everlasting.

Amen.
