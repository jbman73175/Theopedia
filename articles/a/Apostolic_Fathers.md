The **Apostolic Fathers** "consists of persons and documents that
interpreted and applied the apostolic message in the first
apostleless generation..." (Olson,
*The Story of Christian Theology*, p. 41). They were acknowledged
as leaders in the early church because of their close connections
with the Apostles (e.g. [Peter](Peter "Peter"),
[Paul](Paul "Paul"), [John](John "John") etc.). Thus, they provide
a link between the Apostles who knew [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") and the
later generation of Christian
[apologists](index.php?title=Apologists&action=edit&redlink=1 "Apologists (page does not exist)")
and defenders of Christian [orthodoxy](Orthodoxy "Orthodoxy").

## Common list of Apostolic Fathers

The list of Fathers included under this section varies. Agreed on
by all church historians are: Clement, Ignatius, Polycarp, the
*Didache (Teaching of the Twelve Apostles)*, *Epistle of Barnabas*
and *Shepherd of Hermas*. It is important to note that most church
historians actually call certain documents (e.g. the *Didache*
"Church Fathers"). Others find their way to this list, such as the
so-called *Second Letter of Clement*, the *Martyrdom of Polycarp*,
the *Epistle to Diognetus*, and fragment writings by
[Papias](index.php?title=Papias&action=edit&redlink=1 "Papias (page does not exist)")
(Olson, p. 41). This article will focus on those accepted by all.

-   [Clement of Rome](Clement_of_Rome "Clement of Rome"), the third
    successor to [Peter](Peter "Peter") as Bishop of Rome, "had seen
    the blessed Apostles (Peter and Paul) and had been conversant with
    them" (Irenaeus, *Adversus Haereses*, III, iii, 3).

-   [Ignatius of Antioch](Ignatius_of_Antioch "Ignatius of Antioch")
    was the second successor of Peter in the See of Antioch (Eusebius,
    Hist. Eccl., III, 36) and during his life in the center of
    Christian activity he may have met with others of the Apostolic
    band. An accepted tradition, substantiated by the similarity of
    Ignatius's thought with the ideas of the Johannine writings,
    declares that he was a disciple of the
    [Apostle John](John "John").

-   [Polycarp](Polycarp "Polycarp") was "instructed by Apostles"
    (Irenaeus, op. cit., III, iii, 4) and had been a disciple of
    [John](John "John") (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 36; V, 20) whose
    contemporary he was for nearly twenty years. He later trained
    [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") as a disciple, thus giving
    Irenaeus' teachings great reliability and authority.

-   The [Didache](Didache "Didache"), also known as
    *The Teaching of the Lord to the Gentiles by the Twelve Apostles*,
    or *The Teaching of the (Twelve) Apostles* is basically a handbook
    or manual of Christian ethical instruction and church order
    (Holmes,
    *Dictionary of the Later New Testament & Its Developments*, p.
    301).

-   The
    [Epistle of Barnabas](index.php?title=Epistle_of_Barnabas&action=edit&redlink=1 "Epistle of Barnabas (page does not exist)")
    is an early second century document concerned with showing that
    Christians are the true heirs of God's covenant. Its author remains
    anonymous.

-   The
    [Shepherd of Hermas](Shepherd_of_Hermas "Shepherd of Hermas") was a
    popular document in the second and third centuries. It's
    significance rests in that it sheds light on the Christian
    situation at Rome in the mid-second century. The author(s) is
    unknown.

## List of writings

-   The Epistle to Diognetus (this one is hard to date and might
    also be of a later date)
-   The First Epistle of Clement
-   The Second Epistle of Clement (not actually written by Clement,
    but still a very early writing)
-   The Didache
-   The Epistle of Barnabas
-   Seven short Epistles of Ignatius (the longer forms of these
    Epistles, and those beyond the seven, are widely considered later
    emendations and forgeries)
-   The Epistle of Polycarp
-   The Epistle about Polycarp's Martyrdom
-   The
    [Shepherd of Hermas](Shepherd_of_Hermas "Shepherd of Hermas")
-   The fragments from the writings of Papias, which have survived

Most of these works were originally written in Greek. English

Fathers series on the Christian Classics Ethereal Library website.

translators, such as J.B. Lightfoot and Michael Holmes.
