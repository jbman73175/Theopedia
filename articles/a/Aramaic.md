**Aramaic** was the native-tongue of many Aramean tribes that dwelt
between Mesopotamia and Canaan. It emerged as a distinct language
around the 10th century B.C. and quickly spread throughout the
Near-East region. This is due, in part, to the scattered state of
Aramean peoples. It also owes to the fact that they were among the
greatest merchants and traders of the ancient world, second only to
the Phoenicians. Thus, by the end of the 9th century B.C., Aramaic
was the official diplomatic language of the Mesopotamian kingdoms,
and it continued to expand in influence from that point on.

## Dialects

Strictly speaking, all dialects of Aramaic fall into two
categories: Eastern and Western. Their differences came about as a
result of being used in two very different linguistic circles:
Akkadian and [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew"). Babylonian Talmudic Aramaic
began its development during the Exile of the Jews. Although many
returned to Judah, many also remained and the dialect continued to
develop, eventually becoming one of the Talmudic languages.

The other Eastern dialect is known as [Syriac](Syriac "Syriac"),
which originated in Edessa, and spread widely from Syria into
Persia. It was used in Jewish communities in Syria, Aram, and the
surrounding lands.

Western dialects were developed in much the same manner. The
Samaritan language, regardless of its strong connections with
Hebrew, is considered an Aramaic dialect by linguists. It also
possessed some Canaanite characteristics (in pronunciation, etc.)
When Aramaic became the *lingua franca* of Judah, the former Exiles
modified the language to their own purposes and Palestinian
Talmudic was born. This was the principle language of the Jews in
Palestine, even to the days of the Sack of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. All
Jews of Canaan learned this tongue and spoke it, rather than
*Lashon ha-Kodesh*, "The Holy Tongue" as Hebrew was then called
(although many conservative groups still utilized Hebrew at the
time).

## Use In the Tanakh

It was because more and more of the common people did not
understand Hebrew that the Targum was introduced. *Targum* comes
from the Aramaic for “translator” and was originally used to denote
the man responsible for translating the readings from the Tanakh in
the synagogue so that the listeners could understand. As time
passed, translations were written down of the
[Torah](Pentateuch "Pentateuch") and the *Nevi’im* ("Prophets").
These translations of Tanakh divisions still retained the name
“Targum” long after the human translators ceased to be used in the
synagogues. Of the multitude of *Targumim* (plural of Targum) that
were produced during the years before 70 A.D., only a few complete
copies are still extant. These include the Babylonian *Onkelos*,
which is a Torah Targum in Babylonian Talmudic and the
*Targum of Jonathan*, which contains the books of the Prophets.
There also exists the Samaritan Targum, which contains the
Samaritan Pentateuch.\#

## Effects

As important as Aramaic was to Near Eastern literature, and to the
development of the Judeo-Christian canon, it played a much greater
role than any could have foreseen. The three and a half years that
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") of Nazareth ministered publicly, he spoke in
Aramaic and even some of the words he stated in that tongue were
preserved in the [Greek](Greek "Greek") texts of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"). Also, because of
its universality, Aramaic allowed for the quick expansion of the
Judeo-Christian faith, as there were few people in the Near East
who did not understand Aramaic in some form. By the evangelization
of the [Apostles](Apostle "Apostle"), a great wave of literature
was opened up to the Western World - widening the gates of
knowledge and allowing the European Continent to enter into the
wide realms of knowledge - all because of a language.

## Notes

1.  The Samaritan Pentateuch was not very different from that of
    the Hebrew Tanakh but certain commands contained therein were added
    or modified to suit the theological beliefs of the Samaritans
    (worship on Mt. Gerizim, for instance).
