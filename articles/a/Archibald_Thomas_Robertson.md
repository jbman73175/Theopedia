A. T. Robertson
**Archibald Thomas Robertson** (1863 - 1934) was an American
[Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") theologian, born near Chatham,
Virginia and grew up on a farm in North Carolina. He was educated
at Wake Forest University (M.A., 1885) and at the Southern Baptist
Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky, (Th. M., 1888). In 1892
Robertson was appointed professor at Southern Baptist and remained
in that post until a day in 1934 when he dismissed his class early
and went home and died of a stroke.^[[1]](#note-0)^

Robertson is probably best known for his six volume
*Word Pictures of the New Testament*, a work for both the reader
who knew Greek and the reader who did not. Robertson's 1500+ page
magnum opus,
*Grammar of the Greek New Testament in the Light of Historical Research*
has more than stood the test of time. Although dated in some
places, it is still a valuable resource and must for any serious
student of NT Greek.
