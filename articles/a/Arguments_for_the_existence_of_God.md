**Arguments for the existence of God** involve carefully crafted
reasoning with the hope that an individual will come to the
conclusion that [God](God "God") exists.

## Cosmological arguments

### Kalam cosmological argument

The aim of this argument is to show that the universe had a
beginning in the finite past. The argument battles against the
existence of an infinite, temporal regress of past events which
implies a universe that has infinitely existed. This argument
implies the existence of a First Cause.

The form of the argument is:

1.  Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
2.  The universe began to exist.
3.  Therefore, the universe has a cause.

### [Thomistic](Thomism "Thomism") cosmological argument

1.  What we observe in this universe is contingent (i.e. dependent,
    or conditional)
2.  A sequence of causally related contingent things cannot be
    infinite
3.  The sequence of causally dependent contingent things must be
    finite

Conclusion: There must be a first cause in the sequence of
contingent causes

### Leibnizian cosmological argument

The argument comes from a German polymath, Gottfriend Wilhelm
Leibniz. Leibniz wrote, "The first question which should rightly be
asked is this: why is there something rather than nothing?"

The argument runs as follows:

1.  Every existing thing has an explanation of its existence,
    either in the necessity of its own [nature](Nature "Nature") or in
    an external cause.
2.  If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that
    explanation is God.
3.  The universe is an existing thing.
4.  Therefore the explanation of the universe is God.

Some [atheists](Atheism "Atheism") object to premise 2 in that God
does not have to be the explanation, but that the universe can be
what is called a necessary being (one which exists of its own
nature and have no external cause). This was a suggestion of
[David Hume](David_Hume "David Hume") who demanded, "Why may not
the material universe be the neccesarily existent being?"
(Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, part 9). The Kalam
Cosmological Argument is helpful. If Hume (and other atheists) is
right in saying that the universe is a necessary being/thing, then
this implies that the universe is eternal. This is exactly what the
Kalam argument seeks to disprove. Thus, the Kalam is a valuable
supplement to the Leibnizian argument.

## Teleological argument

## Anthropological argument

The anthropological (*anthropos* meaning "man") argument is made on
the basis of the condition of humanity, of mankind's basic moral
standards and the thread a search for a higher being. It is related
to the cosmological and teleological arguments in that it if man
has a yearning for God and a conscience when offending him,
ostensibly these have their origin and cause in God and not in man.
The argument was perhaps most famously posited by Blaise Pascal,
who reasoned that it was better "bet" to believe in God than not to
do so.

## Ontological argument

"The ontological argument attempts to prove God's existence through
abstract reasoning alone. The argument is entirely a priori, i.e.
it involves no empirical evidence at all. Rather, the argument
begins with an explication of the concept of God, and seeks to
demonstrate that God exists on the basis of that concept alone.

"The argument is ingenious. It has the appearance of a linguistic
trick, but it is a difficult task to say precisely what, if
anything, is wrong with it. All forms of the argument make some
association between three concepts: the concepts of God, of
perfection, and of existence. Very roughly, they state that
perfection is a part of the concept of God, and that perfection
entails existence, and so that the concept of God entails God's
existence."
[[1]](http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/ontological.html)

The ontological argument was first formulated by
[Anselm](Anselm "Anselm") of Canterbury (1033-1109), one of the
great medieval philosopher-theologians, in his *Proslogium*,
Chapter 2. Anselm’s ontological argument rests on the
identification of God as “that than which no greater can be
conceived”. Once it is understood that God is that of which no
greater can be conceived, Anselm suggests, it becomes evident that
God must exist.

### Descartes' ontological argument

We have the idea of an infinitely perfect Being. Since we are
finite, and everything around us is finite, the idea of an
infinitely perfect Being could not have originated with us or with
the nature around us. Therefore the idea of an infinitely perfect
Being must have come from such a being - God.
[[2]](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/)

### Argument from desire

If and when we desire, we do so because what we desire exists prior
to our desiring it. Religion at its basic level could be defined as
a desire to please or appease a Supreme Being. Therefore this
Supreme Being must exist.

"The Christian says, 'Creatures are not born with desires unless
satisfaction for those desires exists. A baby feels hunger: well,
there is such a thing as food. A duckling wants to swim: well,
there is such a thing as water. Men feel sexual desire: well, there
is such a thing as sex. If I find in myself a desire which no
experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation
is that I was made for another world. If none of my earthly
pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a
fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it,
but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I
must take care, on the one hand, never to despise, or be unthankful
for, these earthly blessings, and on the other, never to mistake
them for the something else of which they are only a kind of copy,
or echo, or mirage. I must keep alive in myself the desire for my
true country, which I shall not find until after death; I must
never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the
main object of life to press on to that other country and to help
others do the same.'" (Lewis, 136-137)^[[1]](#note-0)^

Also known as **proofs** for God's existence, these arguments have
not always come with full acceptance. Those opposed to
[natural theology](Natural_theology "Natural theology") claim that
God's existence cannot be proven by human reason or the natural
world, and that any attempt to do so runs the risk of becoming a
[God of the Gaps](God_of_the_Gaps "God of the Gaps") argument.
Viewpoints vary, but responses tend to conclude that God can only
be known by supernatural
[revelation](Special_revelation "Special revelation") or
[Scripture alone](Scripture_alone "Scripture alone").
[Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth") is a classic example of this
as he believed that God is exclusively revealed in
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), and Jesus is only
revealed in the [Bible](Bible "Bible"). Proponents of natural
theology vary as well, but most conclude that the existence of God
can be known through human reason although it is not salvific (not
a saving knowledge of God).
[Thomas Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") is characteristic
of this view, holding to the understanding that the created world
reflects aspects of its creator that are apparent to all.
Nonetheless, arguments for the existence of God have been formed
throughout [church history](Church_history "Church history") and
continue to be used today, namely in the area of
[apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics").
