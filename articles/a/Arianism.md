## Ancient Arianism

As with many of the classical heresies, Arianism emerged from the
struggle to reach a consensus on the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity").
It is named after [Arius](Arius "Arius"), whose main concern was
that it did not seem fitting that God should have a son. His
solution, which became known as Arianism, was to propose that the
Son (Jesus) was somewhere between God and man.

"Such is the genuine doctrine of Arius. Using Greek terms, it
denies that the Son is of one essence, nature, or substance with
God; He is not consubstantial (homoousios) with the Father, and
therefore not like Him, or equal in dignity, or co-eternal, or
within the real sphere of Deity."

## Modern Arianism

Modern Arianism shares the ancient belief that Jesus was not (and
thus *is* not) divine, but goes much further â€” reducing Jesus to
"just a guy". Influenced perhaps by
[Naturalism](Naturalism "Naturalism") and
[Materialism](index.php?title=Materialism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Materialism (page does not exist)"),
and thus uncomfortable with any
[supernatural](index.php?title=Supernatural&action=edit&redlink=1 "Supernatural (page does not exist)")
elements, modern Arianism advocates that Jesus was a good and wise
man, perhaps even a prophet, but certainly not divine.

It could be argued that such an extreme view has gone beyond heresy
to [apostasy](Apostasy "Apostasy"), thus changing Arianism from a
church problem to a mission problem. The views are so widely taught
and embraced among liberal churches and seminaries, however, that
it is probably unrealistic to dismiss them so easily.

[N.T. Wright](N.T._Wright "N.T. Wright") describes one specific
incarnation of modern Arianism as five myths which together make up
a
"[Liberal Myth of Christian Origins](Liberal_Myth_of_Christian_Origins "Liberal Myth of Christian Origins")."
