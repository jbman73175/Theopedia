**Arius** (AD 256 - 336) was an early Christian theologian of
Libyan descent, born in
[Antioch](index.php?title=Antioch&action=edit&redlink=1 "Antioch (page does not exist)").
He was described by Epiphanius as "tall, grave, and winning"
[[1]](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01707c.htm).

Arius taught that the [Son of God](Jesus "Jesus") was not eternal,
and was subordinate to
[God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father") (a view known
generally as [Arianism](Arianism "Arianism")). Although he
attracted considerable support at the time, Arius' views were
deemed heretical at the
[Council of Nicaea](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils"),
leading to the formation of the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed").
