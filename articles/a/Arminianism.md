**Arminianism** is a school of theology based on the teachings of
Dutch theologian [Jacob Arminius](Jacob_Arminius "Jacob Arminius"),
for whom it is named. It is perhaps most prominent in the
[Methodist](Methodist "Methodist") movement and found in various
other evangelical circles today. It stands in contrast to
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"), with which it has a long
history of debate. Arminians as well as Calvinists appeal to
various Scriptures and the
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers")
to support their respective views, however the differences remain —
particularly as related to the sovereignty of God in
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") and the ideas of
[election](Election "Election") and
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination").

## Arminian theology

The Arminian party suggested five anti-Calvinist corrections,
articulated in the
[Five articles of Remonstrance](Five_articles_of_Remonstrance "Five articles of Remonstrance")
of 1610, which gave rise to the historic controversy and are
summarized as follows:

### Universal prevenient grace

This grace purportedly restores man's
[free will](Free_will "Free will") which was impaired by the
effects of [original sin](Original_sin "Original sin") and enables
him to choose or refuse the salvation offered by God in Jesus
Christ. Some would say that freedom of will is man's natural state,
not a spiritual gift — and thus free will was not lost in
[the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall"), but cannot be exercised toward
good apart from the grace of God. In either case, God's universal
prevenient grace works upon all alike to influence them for good,
but only those who freely choose to cooperate with grace through
faith and repentance are given new spiritual power to make
effectual the good they otherwise impotently intend. As
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley") stated more forcefully,
humans were in fact totally corrupted by
[original sin](Original_sin "Original sin"), but God's prevenient
grace allowed free will to operate.
[Universal prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace")
is the "hair's breadth" that separates Wesley from the Calvinist
view of [total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity").

*See main articles: [Universal prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace"), [John 12:32](John_12#32 "John 12")*
### Conditional election

This point holds that man is the final arbiter of his election, and
that God elects him on the basis of foreseen faith which is
exercised by
[libertarian free will](Libertarian_free_will "Libertarian free will"),
thus making man ultimately decisive.

God has decreed to save through
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), out of fallen and
sinful mankind, those foreknown by Him who through the grace of the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") believe in Christ; but God
leaves in sin those foreseen, who are incorrigible and unbelieving.
This is in contrast to the Calvinist doctrine of
[unconditional election](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election").

*See main articles: [Election](Election "Election") and [Foreknowledge of God](Foreknowledge_of_God "Foreknowledge of God")*
### Unlimited (or universal) atonement

Christ's death was suffered on behalf of all men and benefits all
men alike. God then [elects](Election "Election") for
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") those whom he foresees will
believe in Christ of their own free will. This is in contrast to
the Calvinist doctrine of
[Limited atonement](Limited_atonement "Limited atonement").

Arminians believe that whatever the
[atonement](Atonement "Atonement") accomplished, it did so
universally for all alike, not just the elect. This point rejects
that the atonement has any component which is decisive or effectual
in gathering of the elect. Rather, the atonement is seen as a
universally effective [propitiation](Propitiation "Propitiation")
and the basis for a universal offer of
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation"). The key verse used for this
position is
[1 John 2:2](http://www.theopedia.com/1_John_2:2 "1 John 2:2").

*See main articles: [Universal atonement](Universal_atonement "Universal atonement") and [Atonement of Christ](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ")*
### Resistible grace

This point holds that God never overcomes the resistance of man to
His saving grace. While both Calvinists and Arminians hold that men
often resist God's grace, Arminianism teaches that this resistance
is rarely conquered by God because this would be a violation of
man's libertarian free will. The grace of God works for good in all
men, and brings about newness of life through faith. But saving
grace can be resisted, even by the regenerate. This is in contrast
to the Calvinist doctrine of
[Irresistible grace](Irresistible_grace "Irresistible grace").

*See main article: [Irresistible grace](Irresistible_grace "Irresistible grace")*
### Uncertainty of perseverance

Those who are incorporated into Christ by a true faith have power
given them through the assisting grace of the Holy Spirit,
sufficient to enable them to persevere in the faith. However, it
may be possible for a believer to fall from grace. This is in
contrast to the Calvinist's
[Perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints").

*See main articles: [Perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints") and [Assurance of salvation](Assurance_of_salvation "Assurance of salvation")*
Not all Arminians have historically embraced this fifth point as
stated. Some have embraced a form of
[eternal security](Eternal_security "Eternal security") which does
not require perseverance in the [faith](Faith "Faith") and an
attitude of [repentance](Repentance "Repentance") for final
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation"). The majority of Arminians,
regardless of their position on this point, still affirm that man
retains
[libertarian free will](Libertarian_free_will "Libertarian free will")
throughout the entirety of earthly life.

The following are also distinctive doctrines and emphases of
Arminianism:

### Libertarian free will

A key tenet of Arminianism is libertarian free will. This means
that our choices are free from the determination or constraints of
human nature and free from any predetermination by God. All "free
will theists" hold that libertarian freedom is essential for moral
responsibility, for if our choice is determined or caused by
anything, including our own desires, they reason, it cannot
properly be called a free choice.

*See main article: [Libertarian free will](Libertarian_free_will "Libertarian free will")*
### Equal, impartial, and undifferentiated love

Arminianism emphasizes God's equal, impartial, and undifferentiated
love for all individuals and denies that God has any sort of
electing, particular love that secures one's redemption from the
foundation of the world. It infers from this universal love that
God would never predestine anyone to hell or hate anyone without
reference to their wickedness.

*See main articles: [John 3:16](John_3#16 "John 3"), [2 Peter 3:9](2_Peter_3#9 "2 Peter 3"), [1 Timothy 2:3-6](1_Timothy_2#3 "1 Timothy 2"), [Romans 9:13](Romans_9#13 "Romans 9"), [Love of God](Love_of_God "Love of God")*
### The universal call of salvation

Arminians hold that God calls all people to Himself through Christ,
whether or not this call is effectual depends upon the individuals
libertarian free will.

## History

Arminianism, as mentioned above, is based on the theology of Dutch
theologian [Jacob Arminius](Jacobus_Arminius "Jacobus Arminius")
(1560-1609). His opposition to some of the teachings of the
[Belgic Confession](Belgic_Confession "Belgic Confession") was
formalized into
[five articles of Remonstrance](Five_articles_of_Remonstrance "Five articles of Remonstrance")
published by his followers in 1610, on the heels of his death. This
Remonstrance was the basis for formal debates in the Reformed
churches and resulted in the national
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort") (1618-1619) where
Arminianism was condemned by the State church. Arminian theology
later received official toleration by the State and has since
continued in various forms within Protestantism.

  
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley") later adopted Arminianism
and it has become the theological position of
[Methodism](Methodism "Methodism") and the Wesleyan tradition. It
was propagated in America through the revivalism of the
[Second Great Awakening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening)
and the burgeoning Methodist movement. It is also found today in
other denominations such as the Nazarene, the
[Pentecostal](Pentecostalism "Pentecostalism"), the
[Assemblies of God](Assemblies_of_God "Assemblies of God"), the
[Churches of Christ](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Christ "wikipedia:Church of Christ"),
the
[Seventh-day Adventist](Seventh_Day_Adventism "Seventh Day Adventism")
and many [Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") groups. Elements of
Arminianism (or its older sister
[Semi-Pelagianism](Semi-Pelagianism "Semi-Pelagianism")) may also
be found in
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism").

## "Moderate Arminianism" or "moderate Calvinism"

In [Norman Geisler](Norman_Geisler "Norman Geisler")'s
*Chosen But Free*, Geisler describes popular Arminianism as
"moderate Calvinism" (also called "moderate Arminianism"), because
it holds to the
[perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints").
This is a confusing and misleading label, however, as Arminianism
has not historically been settled against this point. Arminians
have held a variety of positions on the certainty/uncertainty of
perseverance, and being "Arminian" doesn't necessarily imply that
one holds to the uncertainty of perseverance.

Those who hold to Geisler's categorization sometimes also consider
belief in the [five points of Calvinism](TULIP "TULIP") to be
*hyper*-Calvinistic. ^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Quotes

-   "The providence of God is subordinate to creation; and it is,
    therefore, necessary that it should not impinge against creation,
    which it would do, were it to inhibit or hinder the use of free
    will in man." *The Works of James Arminius*, Vol. 2, p. 460

-   "God decreed to save and damn certain particular persons. This
    decree has its foundation in the foreknowledge of God, by which he
    knew from all eternity those individuals who would, through his
    preventing [going before] grace, believe, and, through his
    subsequent grace would persevere . . . by which foreknowledge, he
    likewise knew those who would not believe and persevere."
    *The Works of James Arminius*, Vol 1, p. 248

## Notes

1.  [↑](#ref-0) "Q: How do you define hyper Calvinist? A: If a
    person holds to reprobation, this is a clear sign. If anyone
    believes that God has created souls damned to hell, and predestined
    them to hell, then they would be a poster child for Hyper
    Calvinism." - Ergun Caner, President of Liberty Theological
    Seminary. URL:
