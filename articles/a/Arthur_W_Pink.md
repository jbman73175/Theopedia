Arthur Pink
**Arthur W. Pink** (1886-1952) "was born in Great Britain and
immigrated to the U.S. to study at Moody Bible Institute. He
pastored churches in Colorado, California, Kentucky, and South
Carolina before becoming an itinerant Bible teacher in 1919. From
1925-1927 he Pastored in Sydney, Australia then went to visit his
hometown of Nottingham, England before returning to the U.S. He
returned to his native land in 1934, taking up residence on the
Isle of Lewis, Scotland, in 1940, and remained there until his
death. Most of his works first appeared as articles in
*Studies in Scriptures*, a monthly magazine concerned solely with
the exposition of Scripture.

"Pink was virtually unknown and certainly unappreciated in his day.
Independent Bible study convinced him that much of modern
evangelism was defective. When Puritan and reformed books were
generally disregarded by the Church as a whole, he advanced the
majority of their principles with untiring zeal. The progressive
spiritual decline of his own nation (Britain) was to him the
inevitable consequence of the prevalence of a "gospel" that could
neither wound (with conviction of sin) nor heal (via
regeneration).

"Familiar with the whole range of revelation, Pink was rarely
sidetracked from the great themes of Scripture: grace,
justification, and sanctification. Our generation owes him a great
debt for the enduring light he has shed, by God's grace, on the
Truth of the Holy Bible."

After Pink's death, his works were republished by The Banner of
Truth Trust and reached a much wider audience as a result.
Biographer [Iain H. Murray](Iain_H._Murray "Iain H. Murray")
observes of Pink, "the widespread circulation of his writings after
his death made him one of the most influential evangelical authors
in the second half of the twentieth century." His writing sparked a
revival of expository preaching and focused readers' hearts on
biblical living. Yet even today, Pink is left out of most
biographical dictionaries and overlooked in many religious
histories.

Pink was an ardent Calvinist and did not shrink from preaching and
teaching the "doctrines of grace" otherwise known as the Five
Points of [Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"). He was a voluminous
writer generating over 2000 expository articles and dozens of
books, the more notable of which are:

-   The Sovereignty of God
-   The Divine Inspiration of the Bible
-   The Attributes of God
-   An Exposition of Hebrews (3 Volumes)
-   An Exposition of the Gospel of John
-   An Exposition of the Sermon on the Mount
-   Gleanings in Exodus
-   Gleanings in Genesis
-   Gleanings in Joshua
-   Our Accountability to God
