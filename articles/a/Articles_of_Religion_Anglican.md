The **Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion** together with the
[Anglican Catechism](Anglican_Catechism "Anglican Catechism") are
the defining statements of [Anglican](Anglican "Anglican")
doctrine. They were issued by the Convocation of clergy of the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England") in 1571
and are printed in the
[Book of Common Prayer](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer "wikipedia:Book of Common Prayer")
and other Anglican prayer books. From 1673 to 1828, the Test Act
made adherence to the Thirty-Nine Articles a requirement for
holding civil office in England.

The Articles were not intended as a complete statement of the
Christian faith, but as a statement of the position of the Church
of England over against the Roman Catholic Church and some
continental Reformers. The Articles highlight some of the major
differences between Anglican and [Catholic](Catholic "Catholic")
doctrine, as well as more conventional declarations of a
[Trinitarian](Trinity "Trinity") Christianity. The Articles also
argue against some [Anabaptist](Anabaptist "Anabaptist") positions
such as the holding of goods in common, and the necessity of
believer's baptism.

Outside the Church of England, Anglican views of the Thirty-Nine
Articles vary. The Episcopal Church in the United States regards
them as an historical document and does not require members to
adhere to them.

Anglican clergyman [John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley") adapted
the Thirty-Nine Articles for utilization by
[Methodists](Methodism "Methodism") in the 18th century. The
adapted
[Articles of Religion](Articles_of_Religion_(Methodist) "Articles of Religion (Methodist)")
remain official United Methodist doctrine.
