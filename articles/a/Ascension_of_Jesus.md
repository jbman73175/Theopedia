The Ascension by Rembrandt (1636)
The **Ascension of Jesus** refers to Jesus bodily ascending to
heaven in the presence of his apostles, forty days following his
[resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection"). This ascension is well
attested in the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"),
described in Mark 16:19, Luke 24:51, and Acts 1:1-12. The ascension
takes place after his [resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection")
(John 20:17; Acts 1:3). In the gospel of [Luke](Luke "Luke") it is
stated that "he left them and was taken up into heaven" (Luke
24:51). In [Acts](Acts "Acts"), Luke adds that, "...he was taken up
to heaven" (Acts 1:2) and that, "This same Jesus, who has been
taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have
seen him go into heaven" (Acts 1:11). When Jesus actually ascended,
"he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from
their sight" (Acts 1:9).

Most references in [Scripture](Scripture "Scripture") speak of
Jesus' ascended status and do not actually mention how he came to
be in heaven. These passages speak more of Jesus' "exalted state",
that is, his present status in heaven after the experience of his
ascension. Most notably is the quotation of Psalm 110:1, "sitting
at the right hand of God". This is the most quoted OT text in the
NT. Mark places the use of this Psalm in the very teachings of
Jesus (Mark 12:35-37; 14:62). Furthermore, Paul gives reference to
Jesus' exalted state in
[Philippians](Epistle_to_the_Philippians "Epistle to the Philippians")
2:8-11, stating in verses 9-11 that "...God exalted him to the
highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that
at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth
and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, to the glory of
[God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father")." Elsewhere, Paul
makes reference to Christ being "taken up in glory" (1 Timothy
3:16). Other passages attest the very same about Jesus and give
suggestion to his ascension into heaven (cf. John 6:62, 13:1-3,
16:5 & 28, 20:17; Acts 2:32-33; Hebrews 4:14, 9:24; 1 Peter 3:22;
Revelation 1:12-18, 3:21).
