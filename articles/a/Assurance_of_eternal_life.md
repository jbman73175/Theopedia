**Assurance**, not to be confused with
[Eternal Security](Perseverance_of_the_saints#Eternal_Security "Perseverance of the saints")
or
[Perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints"),
is the [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") which states that the inner
witness of the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") in
conjunction with the outward manifestation of the
[fruits of the Spirit](Fruit_of_the_Spirit "Fruit of the Spirit")
allows the believer *to know* (be assured) that he/she is saved and
has eternal life. The
[apostle John's](John_the_Apostle "John the Apostle") epistle's
have this theme, especially his first epistle,

"I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of
God *that you may know* that you have eternal life." (1 John 5:13)
"Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and
in truth. By this we shall know that we are of the truth and
*reassure* our heart before him; for whenever our heart condemns
us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything." (1
John 3:18-20)
A biblical concept expressed in the writings of
[Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") and emphasized by the Reformers,
*assurance* is historically a very important doctrine among
[Protestants](Protestantism "Protestantism") and remains so in many
denominations today. In contrast, the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") church teaches
that one may hope in his salvation, but cannot *know for sure*
since [justification](Justification "Justification") is seen as a
process and one's life is not yet completed.

While most Protestants believe that one can have "assurance" that
they are saved at any given point in time, many such as
[Methodists](Methodism "Methodism") and
[Lutherans](Lutheranism "Lutheranism") believe that one's salvation
can be subsequently lost through sinful behavior or rejection of
the gospel. In contrast, the Reformed tradition links the doctrine
of assurance with the doctrine of
[Perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints")
(or eternal security) which maintains that true believers will not
fall away from the faith.
