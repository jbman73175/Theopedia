Athanasius of Alexandria
**Athanasius** (298â€“373 A.D.) was a bishop of Alexandria (Egypt),
in the fourth century. He is revered as a [Saint](Saint "Saint") by
both the [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") Church
and the [Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox")
Church, and recognized as a great leader and doctor of the early
church by [Protestants](Protestantism "Protestantism").

## Biographical overview

Before reaching the age of 20, Athanasius wrote a treatise entitled
*On the Incarnation*, affirming and explaining that Jesus was both
God and Man. In about 319, when Athanasius was a
[deacon](Deacon "Deacon"), a presbyter named Arius began teaching
that there was a time before God the Father begat Jesus Christ when
the latter did not exist. Athanasius responded that the Father's
begetting of the Son, or uttering of the Word, was an eternal
relationship between them, not an event that took place within
time. Thus began catholic Christianity's fight against the heresy
of [Arianism](Arianism "Arianism"). Athanasius fought consistently
against Arianism all his life. He accompanied bishop Alexander to
the First Council of Nicaea in 325, which council produced the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") and anathematized Arius
and his followers. On May 9, 328, he succeeded Alexander as bishop
of Alexandria. As a result of rises and falls in Arianism's
influence, he was banished from Alexandria only to be later
restored on at least five separate occasions, perhaps as many as
seven. This gave rise to the expression "Athanasius contra mundum"
or "Athanasius against the world". During some of his exiles, he
spent time with the Desert Fathers, monks and hermits who lived in
remote areas of Egypt.

Athanasius is also the first person to identify the same 27 books
of the New Testament that are in use today; up until his Easter
letter, various similar lists were in use. However, his list was
the one that was eventually ratified by a series of synods and came
to be universally recognized as the New Testament canon.

The [Athanasian Creed](Athanasian_Creed "Athanasian Creed") is a
statement of Christian doctrine traditionally ascribed to
Athanasius; however most of today's historians agree that in all
probability it was originally written in Latin, not in Greek, and
thus Athanasius cannot have been the original author. Its theology
is closely akin to that found in the writing of western
theologians, especially
[Ambrose of Milan](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose_of_Milan "wikipedia:Ambrose of Milan")
(340 - 397 A.D.). It was designed to overcome
[Arianism](Arianism "Arianism"), the focus of much of Athanasius'
work, and though not the author it rightly bears his name.
