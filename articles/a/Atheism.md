**Atheism** is the belief that there is *no God*, from the negative
*a* + *theism*. While atheism may broadly deny the existence of any
god(s) or divine beings, it most often is a denial of the God
revealed in the Bible. This may be contrasted with
[agnosticism](Agnosticism "Agnosticism"), which neither affirms
belief in God ([theism](Theism "Theism")) nor denies God (atheism)
but leaves the question of the existence of God open or declares it
*unknowable*. From a Christian perspective, some would also see
agnosticism as a *denial*, like atheism, since natural revelation
reveals to all, Christian or not, that there is a God, and special
revelation, i.e. God's Word in the Bible, reveals the particular
Christian, Triune God.
