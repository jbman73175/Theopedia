To be **atheological** refers to someone or something (i.e. Church,
belief system) that is not concerned with
[theology](Theology "Theology") as a fundamental part of its
[worldview](Worldview "Worldview"). When used to describe people,
it indicates an indifference to [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") or
supreme reality. One can be atheological and be well acquainted
with one's religion. What makes one atheological is that the "why"
questions to their fundamental life choices are not answered by a
theology-driven worldview. Many of the Pharisees, for example, were
atheological. They knew the scriptures, but they rejected
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") in order to preserve their status quo and
culture.
