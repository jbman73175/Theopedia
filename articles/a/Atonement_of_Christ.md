The **[Atonement](Atonement "Atonement") of Christ** is the
sacrificial work of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") for sinners. In his
death on the cross, Christ atoned for the sins of humanity such
that [God](God "God") is satisfied and reconciliation is
accomplished for all who will be redeemed. The obedience and death
of Christ on behalf of sinners is the ground of
[redemption](Redemption "Redemption").

## Necessity of the atonement

As stated above, Jesus' death satisfied and reconciled sinners to
God. Yet, in order to fully appreciate the
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of the atonement it must be made
clear why the atonement was necessary.

## Theories of the atonement

### Historic theories

-   **The Ransom Theory:** The earliest of all, originating with
    the Early Church Fathers, this theory claims that Christ offered
    himself as a ransom (Mark 10:45). Where it was not clear was in its
    understanding of exactly to whom the ransom was paid. Many early
    church fathers viewed the ransom as paid to Satan.

-   **The Recapitulation Theory:** Originated with
    [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") (125-202 AD). He sees Christ as the
    new Adam, who systematically *undoes* what Adam did. Thus, where
    Adam was disobedient concerning God's edict concerning the fruit of
    the Tree of Knowledge, Christ was obedient even to death on the
    wood of a tree. Irenaeus is the first to draw comparisons between
    Eve and Mary, contrasting the faithlessness of the former with the
    faithfulness of the latter. In addition to reversing the wrongs
    done by Adam, Irenaeus thinks of Christ as "recapitulating" or
    "summing up" human life.
    *See main page on [Recapitulation theory of atonement](Recapitulation_theory_of_atonement "Recapitulation theory of atonement")*

-   **The Satisfaction (or Commercial) Theory:** The formulator of
    this theory was the medieval theologian Anselm of Canterbury
    (1034-1109), in his book, *Cur Deus Homo* (lit. *Why the God Man*).
    In his view, God's offended honor and dignity could only be
    satisfied by the sacrifice of the God-man, Jesus Christ. "Anselm
    offered compelling biblical evidence that the atonement was not a
    ransom paid by God to the devil but rather a debt paid to God on
    behalf of sinners."^[[1]](#note-0)^ Anselm's work established a
    foundation for the Protestant Reformation, specifically the
    understanding of justification by faith.
    *See main page on [Satisfaction theory](Satisfaction_theory "Satisfaction theory")*

-   **The Penal-Substitution Theory:** This view was formulated by
    the 16th century Reformers as an extension of Anselm's
    [Satisfaction theory](Satisfaction_theory "Satisfaction theory").
    Anselm's theory was correct in introducing the satisfaction aspect
    of Christ's work and its necessity, however the Reformers saw it as
    insufficient because it was referenced to God's honor rather than
    his justice and holiness and was couched more in terms of a
    commercial transaction than a penal substitution. This Reformed
    view says simply that Christ died for man, in man's place, taking
    his sins and bearing them for him. The bearing of man's sins takes
    the punishment for them and sets the believer free from the penal
    demands of the law: The righteousness of the law and the holiness
    of God are satisfied by this substitution.
    *See main page on [Penal substitution theory](Penal_substitution_theory "Penal substitution theory")*

-   **The Moral-Example Theory (or Moral-Influence Theory):**
    Christ died to influence mankind toward moral improvement. This
    theory denies that Christ died to satisfy any principle of divine
    justice, but teaches instead that His death was designed to greatly
    impress mankind with a sense of God's love, resulting in softening
    their hearts and leading them to repentance. Thus, the Atonement is
    not directed towards God with the purpose of maintaining His
    justice, but towards man with the purpose of persuading him to
    right action. Formulated by Peter Abelard (1079-1142) partially in
    reaction against Anselm's *Satisfaction theory*, this view was held
    by the 16th century Socinians. Versions of it can be found later in
    F. D. E. Schleiermacher (1768-1834) and Horace Bushnell
    (1802-1876).
    *See main page on [Moral Influence theory](Moral_Influence_theory "Moral Influence theory")*

-   **The Governmental Theory:** God made Christ an example of
    suffering to exhibit to erring man that sin is displeasing to him.
    God's moral government of the world made it necessary for him to
    evince his wrath against sin in Christ. Christ died as a token of
    God's displeasure toward sin and it was accepted by God as
    sufficient; but actually God does not exact strict justice. This
    view was formulated by Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) and is subsequently
    found in Arminianism, Charles Finney, the New England Theology of
    Jonathan Edwards (the younger), and Methodism.
    *See main page on [Governmental theory of atonement](Governmental_theory_of_atonement "Governmental theory of atonement")*

### Modern theories

-   **The Declaratory Theory:** A version of the Moral Influence
    theory, wherein Christ died to show men how greatly God loves them.
    This view held by Albrecht Ritschl (1822-89).
-   **The Guaranty Theory:** Reconciliation is based not on
    Christ's expiation of sin, but on His guaranty to win followers and
    thus conquer human sinfulness. This view held by J. C. K. von
    Hofmann (1810-77).
-   **The Vicarious Repentance Theory:** by John McLeod Campbell
    (d. 1872). It assumes that a perfect repentance is sufficient to
    atone for sin. In his death, Christ entered into the Father's
    condemnation of sin, condemned sin, and by this, confessed it.
-   **The 'Christus Victor' or Dramatic Theory:** by
    [G. E. H. Aulén](Gustaf_Aulén "Gustaf Aulén") (1879-1977). The
    atonement is viewed as divine conflict and victory over the hostile
    powers that hold humanity in subjection. This is a modified form of
    the classic Ransom theory with the emphasis on Christ's victory
    over evil.
    *See main article [Christus Victor](Christus_Victor "Christus Victor").*
-   **The Accident Theory:** Christ's death was an accident, as
    unforeseen and unexpected as that of any other victim of man's
    hatred. This view is usually found outside of mainstream
    Christianity.
-   **The Martyr Theory:** Christ gave up His life for a principle
    of truth that was opposed to the spirit of His day. This view is
    usually found outside of mainstream Christianity.

## Sufficiency of Christ's person and his atoning death

The deity of Christ establishes the infinite intrinsic value of his
person. Since Jesus Christ is the God-man, truly God and truly man,
his death is also of infinite intrinsic value and all-sufficient as
a sacrifice. The book of Hebrews clearly says that the sufficiency
of Christ's death negated the need for additional sacrifices. The
biblical word translated *once for all* (Greek *ephapax* in Rom.
6:10; Heb. 9:26, 28; 10:10) is clearly a contrast with the Old
Testament yearly sacrifice on the Day of Atonement and declares the
complete sufficiency of Christ's death.

The infinite intrinsic value and all-sufficiency of Christ's death
is a doctrine maintained in the Reformed tradition. The
[Canons of Dort](Canons_of_Dort "Canons of Dort"), which is the
historical statement of the so-called "five points of
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism")" formulated at the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort") (1618-1619), state:

This death of the Son of God is the only and most perfect sacrifice
and satisfaction for sins, of infinite value and worth, abundantly
sufficient to expiate the sins of the whole world. This death is of
such great value and worth because the person who submitted to it
is not only a true and perfectly holy man, but also the
only-begotten Son of God, of the same eternal and infinite essence
with the Father and the Holy Spirit, for these qualifications were
necessary for our Savior. Further, this death is of such great
value and worth because it was accompanied by a sense of the wrath
and curse of God, which we by our sins had deserved, (Second Head,
Articles 3 & 4).
[John Owen](John_Owen "John Owen") (1616-1683) echos the same
position, "It was then the purpose and intention of God that his
Son should offer a sacrifice of infinite worth, value, and dignity,
sufficient *in itself* for the redeeming of all and every man, if
it had pleased the Lord to employ it to that purpose. . .
Sufficient we say, then, was the sacrifice of Christ for the
redemption of the whole world, and for the expiation of all the
sins of all and every man in the world," (*Works*, vol. 10, pp.
295, 296).

## The extent of the atonement

The issue with most non-Calvinists is the doctrine of a
[definite atonement](Definite_atonement "Definite atonement") (or
limited atonement). This is not so much a question of the
"sufficiency" of Christ's death as it is a question of the design
(or intent) of Christ's death.

Did Christ intend to accomplish redemption, propitiation and
reconciliation for every man? Did He intend to make salvation
possible for all men? Reformed theology maintains that, though
Christ's death is of infinite value and is sufficient to redeem
every man (had this been God's intention), the true intention of
Christ's death was to accomplish effectively the full salvation of
the elect, and the elect only.

**Calvinism:** The design of the atonement was to redeem the
elect.

*Main page: [definite atonement](Definite_atonement "Definite atonement")*
**Arminianism:** The design of the atonement was to make all men
savable.
