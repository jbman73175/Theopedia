*"What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us..."*
^[[1]](#note-0)^
The **attributes of God** are generally a collection of
descriptions from Scripture of who [God](God "God") is. An
"attribute" can be defined as something [God](God "God") has
revealed himself to be. [Colin Gunton](Colin_Gunton "Colin Gunton")
correctly guides our thinking here, reminding us that "it is not a
matter of what *we attribute*, but of what he *reveals himself* to
be." ^[[2]](#note-1)^ Thus, God's attributes are revealed truths of
who he is and are revealed in scripture through his words and
actions in the divine economy.

## Preliminary discussion

Before describing which attributes God has revealed, it is
important to understand how these attributes correspond to God's
very being. That is, the "attributes of God should not be
considered parts of him, but rather are perspectives on his whole
being, that is, his [essence](Essence "Essence")." ^[[3]](#note-2)^
The love of God is not a part of him. "Our standard of love is not
something in God, alongside other things, but God himself."
^[[4]](#note-3)^ This line of thinking helps protect against
thinking of God as an abstract thing, remembering that he is a
personal God in which his attributes reveal his character and
traits.

Furthermore, it is essential to understand that each attribute has
all the attributes. In other words, they cannot be separated. God's
love is perfect, righteous, holy, and eternal. His power is just,
wise, and loving. The examples can only continue, but again, it is
important that God's attributes are understood in light of all
others. They cannot be separated or set apart from the others.

## Classifying the attributes of God

The attributes of God are generally classified into two groups:
those that are unique to God, and those that are shared with His
creatures. Although this has been a helpful classification, the
distinction does not always perfectly work.

*See main page: [Classification of the attributes of God](Classification_of_the_attributes_of_God "Classification of the attributes of God")*
## God's attributes

Depending on how you look at God's attributes, they can comprise a
list of varying lengths. Some suggest that because God is infinite,
his attributes are infinite, while others believe there are a set
amount. Nonetheless, it remains important to go over the ways in
which God has revealed himself to humanity.
