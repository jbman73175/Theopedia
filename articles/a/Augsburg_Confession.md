"In 1530, Charles V, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, called
together the princes and cities of his german territories in a
[Diet at Augsburg](index.php?title=Diet_at_Augsburg&action=edit&redlink=1 "Diet at Augsburg (page does not exist)").
He sought unity among them to fend off the attacks of Turkish
armies in Eastern Austria. He called upon the Lutheran nobility to
explain their religious convictions, with the hope that the
controversy swirling around the challange of the Reformation might
be resolved. To this end,
[Philip Melanchthon](Philip_Melanchthon "Philip Melanchthon"), a
close friend of [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") and
a Professor of New Testament at
[Wittenberg University](index.php?title=Wittenberg_University&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wittenberg University (page does not exist)"),
was called upon to draft a common confession for the Lutheran Lords
and Free Territories. The resulting document, the Augsburg
Confession was presented to the emperor on June 25, 1530."
