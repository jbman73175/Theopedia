**Aurelius Augustinus** (354 - 430) is often simply referred to as
**St. Augustine** or **Augustine Bishop of Hippo** (the ancient
name of the modern city of Annaba in Algeria). He is the
pre-eminent "Doctor of the Church" according to
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism"), and is
considered by Evangelical Protestants to be in the tradition of the
Apostle Paul as the theological fountainhead of the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation") teaching on
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") and [grace](Grace "Grace").

## Life

Augustine was born in 354 in Tagaste, a provincial Roman city in
North Africa. He was raised and educated in Carthage. His mother
Monica was a devout Christian and his father Patricius a pagan. His
father converted to Christianity on his death bed, which came from
the persuasion of his wife. As a youth Augustine followed the
unpopular Manichaean religion, much to the horror of his mother. In
Carthage, he developed a relationship with a young woman who would
be his concubine for over a decade and produce a son. His education
and early career was in philosophy and rhetoric, the art of
persuasion and public speaking. He taught in Tagaste and Carthage,
but soon aspired to compete with the best, in Rome. However,
Augustine grew disappointed with the Roman schools, which he found
apathetic. Manichaean friends introduced him to the prefect of the
City of Rome, Symmachus, who had been asked to provide a professor
of rhetoric for the imperial court at Milan.

The young provincial won the job and headed north to take up his
position in late 384. At age thirty, Augustine had won the most
visible academic chair in the Latin world, at a time when such
posts gave ready access to political careers. However, he felt the
tensions of life at an imperial court, lamenting one day as he rode
in his carriage to deliver a grand speech before the emperor, that
a drunken beggar he passed on the street had a less careworn
existence than he.

Although Monica pressed the claims of Christianity, it is the
bishop of Milan, [Ambrose](Ambrose "Ambrose"), who had most
influence over Augustine. Ambrose was a master of rhetoric like
Augustine himself, but older and more experienced. Prompted by
Ambrose's sermons, Augustine moved away from Manichaeism, but
instead of becoming Catholic like Ambrose, he converted to pagan
Neoplatonism. Augustine's mother followed him to Milan and he
allowed her to arrange a society marriage, for which he abandoned
his concubine (however he had to wait two years until his fiance
came of age; he promptly took up in the meantime with another
woman).

In the summer of 386, in a garden, Augustine underwent a profound
personal crisis and decided to convert to Christianity, abandon his
career in rhetoric, quit his teaching position in Milan, give up
any ideas of marriage (much to the horror of his mother), and
devote himself full time to religion, celibacy and the priesthood.
Ambrose baptized Augustine on Easter day in 387, and soon
thereafter in 388 he returned to Africa. On his way back to Africa
his mother died, as did his son soon after, leaving him relatively
alone.

In 391 he was ordained a priest in Hippo Regius, (now Annaba, in
Algeria). He became a famous preacher (more than 350 preserved
sermons are believed to be authentic), and was noted for combating
the Manichaean heresy.

In 396 he was made coadjutor bishop of Hippo (assistant with the
right of succession on the death of the current bishop), and
remained as bishop in Hippo until his death in 430. He left his
monastery, but continued to lead a monastic life in the episcopal
residence.

Augustine died on August 28, 430, during the siege of Hippo by the
Vandals. He is said to have encouraged its citizens to resist the
attacks, primarily on the grounds that the Vandals adhered to
[Arianism](Arianism "Arianism"), which had been condemned as
heretical.

## Influence as a theologian and thinker

Augustine remains a central figure, both within Christianity and in
the history of Western thought. As he himself was much influenced
by Platonism and Neoplatonism, particularly by Plotinus, Augustine
was important to the "baptism" of Greek thought and its entrance
into the Christian, and subsequently the European intellectual
tradition. Also important was his early and influential writing on
the human will, a central topic in ethics, and one which became a
focus for later philosophers such as Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. It
is largely due to Augustine's arguments against the
[Pelagians](Pelagianism "Pelagianism"), who did not believe in
original sin, that Western Christianity has maintained the doctrine
of original sin. Augustine also contended that God exists outside
of time in the "eternal present" -- time existing only within the
created universe.

Augustine's writings helped formulate the theory of the just war.
He also advocated the use of force against the
[Donatists](Donatism "Donatism"), asking "Why ... should not the
Church use force in compelling her lost sons to return, if the lost
sons compelled others to their destruction?" (The Correction of the
Donatists, 22-24)

[Thomas Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") took much from
Augustine's theology while creating his own unique synthesis of
Greek and Christian thought. Two later theologians who claimed
special influence from Augustine were
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") and Cornelius Jansen.
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") developed as a part of
Reformation theology, while Jansenism was a movement inside the
Roman Catholic Church; some Jansenists went into schism and formed
their own church.

[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") was an ardent student of
Augustine's writings which is abundantly evident in his
*Institutes* and the basic tenets of
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"). Augustine taught that man has
nothing to do with his own [salvation](Salvation "Salvation"). Man
has inherited the
[totally depraved](Total_depravity "Total depravity") nature of
Adam and Eve after [the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall") -- to the point
they are spiritually incapable of availing themselves of God's
grace. As a result of the depraved Adamic nature being inherited,
infants are born in sin and with a
[sinful nature](Original_sin "Original sin"). Augustine argued that
the only way any are saved is by God intervening and choosing some
whom he calls his elect to be saved. This
[choosing](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election") is
totally independent of those chosen. Those thus chosen cannot ever
be lost or fall from grace. Conversely, those not sovereignly
chosen before the foundation of the world to everlasting life are
irrevocably doomed to hell.

Augustine was canonized by popular recognition and recognized as a
Doctor of the Church in 1303 by Pope Boniface VIII. His feast day
is August 28, the day on which he is thought to have died. Roman
Catholics consider him the patron saint of brewers, printers,
theologians, sore eyes, and a number of cities and dioceses.

"*De Doctrina Christiana* (On Christian Teaching) is the book
Augustine wrote to train preachers. He composed three chapters on
how to understand the Bible, then after thirty years of regular
preaching, added a final chapter on how to communicate what has
been understood."

## Augustine on the problem of evil

Scholars have carefully investigated Augustine's life due to his
contributions to [theodicy](Theodicy "Theodicy"), the problem of
evil. Throughout Augustine's youth, he had been involved in a
belief called [Manicheanism](Manicheanism "Manicheanism"). This was
an ancient religion from Persia that accounted for the world's
entire disharmony in terms of an eternal struggle between physical
light and darkness or good and evil. After several years as an
adherent of the Manichaean religion, Augustine read the writings of
Neoplatonists such as Plotinus, which in turn helped him move
beyond the materialism of Manichaeism. Then, at the age of 32,
Augustine became a Christian.

Augustine now an adamant follower of Christ sought to deal with the
problem of evil. The Scriptures taught that his monotheistic God
was all good and all-powerful therefore he desired to understand
how and why sin and evil existed. Augustine discovered
experientially and biblically that his sin problem was more than
one of knowledge or wrong thinking. His affections and will also
reacted against what God knew, loved, and willed. He realized that
he could not, by his own thinking transform the depravity of his
own nature, overcome his separation from God, or remove his verdict
of guilt before God's justice. The prodigal son realized his
[total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity") and the need
for God's grace for any hope.

Augustine consequently proposed a solution to the problem of evil
in the world attributing it to [the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall") of
humanity after the disobedience in the Garden of Eden. From this
view, Man is responsible for evil by being led astray by Satan.
Accordingly, this not only absolves God of creating evil but also
allows Him to show the world His love by bringing Christ into the
world. (Cf. *Confessions*, 4:24, 5:20, 7:4)

## Early Christian writings

The historical and biographical significance of Augustine's early
writings are greatly debated. Were these his only writings, he
would have remained a respected but minor figure.^[[1]](#note-0)^

-   *[Against the Academics](Against_the_Academics "Against the Academics")*.
    386 A.D. (Contra academicos)
-   *On Providence*. 386 A.D. (De ordine)
-   *On the Blessed Life*. 386 A.D. (De beata vita)
-   *Soliloquies*. 386/387 A.D. (Soliloquia)

## Quotes

-   "Laziness pretends to yearn for rest, but what sure rest is
    there except in the Lord? Luxury would gladly be called plenty and
    abundance, but You are the fullness and unfailing abundance of
    unfading joy. Promiscuity presents a show of liberality, but You
    are the most lavish giver of all things good. Covetousness desires
    to possess much, but You are already the possessor of all things.
    Envy contends that its aim is for excellence, but what is as
    excellent as You? Anger seeks revenge, but who avenges more justly
    than You? Fear shrinks back as sudden change threatens the way
    things are and fear is wary of its own security, but what can
    happen that is unfamiliar or sudden to You, O God? Or who can
    deprive You of what You love? Where is there unshaken security
    except with You? Grief longs for those delightful things we've lost
    because it wills to have nothing taken from it, just as nothing can
    be taken from You." -*Confessions*, Book 2
-   "As we must often swallow wholesome bitters, so we must always
    avoid unwholesome sweets. But what is better than wholesome
    sweetness or sweet wholesomeness? For the sweeter we try to make
    such things, the easier it is to make their wholesomeness
    serviceable. And so there are writers of the Church who have
    expounded the Holy Scriptures, not only with wisdom, but with
    eloquence as well; and there is not more time for the reading of
    these than is sufficient for those who are studious and at leisure
    to exhaust them."
-   "During all those years [of rebellion], where was my free will?
    What was the hidden, secret place from which it was summoned in a
    moment, so that I might bend my neck to your easy yoke . . .? How
    sweet all at once it was for me to be rid of those fruitless joys
    which I had once feared to lose . . ! You drove them from me, you
    who are the true, the sovereign joy. You drove them from me and
    took their place, you who are sweeter than all pleasure, ...you who
    outshine all light, yet are hidden deeper than any secret in our
    hearts, you who surpass all honor, though not in the eyes of men
    who see all honor in themselves. . . . O Lord my God, my Light, my
    Wealth, and my Salvation." -*Confessions*, Chapter 9
