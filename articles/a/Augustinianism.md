**Augustinianism** can be broadly defined as theology related to
the teachings of [Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") (354-430), one
of the
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers").
However, the term Augustinianism usually has a more specific
reference to Augustine's doctrines of the
[depravity of man](Total_depravity "Total depravity") and the
sovereignty of God's [grace](Grace "Grace") in
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation"). It was these views that were
specifically opposed in the [Pelagian](Pelagianism "Pelagianism")
controversy during Augustine's later years. These doctrines of
Augustine were later revived during the
[Protestant Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation")
and reflected in the teaching of reformers like
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") and
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"). As a result,
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") in particular is sometimes
referred to as Augustinianism.

## Doctrinal distinctives

Augustinianism holds that, after [the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall"),
mankind is unable to not [sin](Sin "Sin"). In other words, due to
the corruption of human nature in the Fall, one's will is not free,
but rather a slave to sin. As such, every person is born sinful and
justly under the condemnation of God. In order for a person to be
delivered from this dreadful state (i.e. saved), [God](God "God")
must intervene. This view of the natural state of
[humanity](Humanity "Humanity") is often referred to as the
doctrine of [total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity").

Grace also plays a significant role in Augustinianism. The grace of
God is free, necessary, and comes before any righteous act of the
sinner. Grace is usually also said to be
[irresistible and effectual](Irresistible_grace "Irresistible grace")
in the sense that all who are given such grace will surely come to
faith in Christ.

Furthermore, Augustinianism has a distinct view of
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination"). Grace is given
to those whom God has predestined before the earth began, and is
not based on the
[foreknowledge of God](Foreknowledge_of_God "Foreknowledge of God").
The predestination in a fully Augustinian system is without any
merit in the sinner themselves. ^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Early controversy

Augustinianism is a system that grew out the controversy with
[Pelagius](Pelagius "Pelagius"). The Pelagian system taught nearly
the opposite of the Augustinian view, making
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") a choice of free will and having
a less severe view of the Fall of humanity in the Garden. Augustine
wrote many works against Pelagius beginning around 412. The
controversy raged in North Africa and stretch to Jerusalem for many
years. Several synods condemned Pelagius and his followers and at
least one cleared him of all charges of heresy. Both sides appealed
to the reigning [Pope](Pope "Pope") when matters were not easily
resolved. Pope Innocent sided with Augustinianism against
Pelagianism, but his successor, Pope Zosimus, was more friendly to
Pelagian thought. In the end, Augustinianism triumphed at the Third
Ecumenical
[Council of Ephesus](Council_of_Ephesus "Council of Ephesus") in
431. Augustinianism was declared to be the doctrine of the church
and Pelagianism a heresy. Augustine himself died the year before
the triumph of his doctrine.^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Latter developments

Although Pelagianism was deemed [heretical](Heresy "Heresy"), in
time a [Semi-Pelagianism](Semi-Pelagianism "Semi-Pelagianism")
arose against the Augustinian view. This semi-Pelagian theology had
great support in France and was declared orthodox by multiple
synods, but was finally condemned in the
[Council of Orange](Council_of_Orange "Council of Orange") in 529.
However, the Council of Orange did not affirm every point of
Augustinianism, leading to what is sometimes called
semi-Augustinianism. The Canons of the Council of Orange affirmed
the depravity of humanity after the Fall and the free nature of
grace. It also asserted that grace comes first before any act of a
person. However, it did not address predestination nor did it speak
of the irresistible nature of grace that is clearly taught and held
in Augustinian proper. Thus, a semi-Augustinianism was created that
allowed for a rejection of predestination for grace to be given to
all and rejected by some.

The
[Protestant Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation")
often referred to itself as a return to a full-fledged
Augustinianism. [Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"),
[Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"), and other reformers often
enlisted the works of Augustine in the defense of their theology.
In particular, John Calvin incorporated Augustine's teachings on
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination"), sovereign grace,
and the depravity of man into his theology. Thus,
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") and Augustinianism are sometimes
used synonymously.
