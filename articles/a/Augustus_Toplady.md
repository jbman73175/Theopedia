Augustus Toplady
**Augustus Montague Toplady** (1740–1778),
[Anglican](Anglican "Anglican") divine, was born at Farnham,
Surrey, and educated at Westminster and Trinity College, Dublin.

Although originally a follower of
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley"), in 1758 he adopted strong
[Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") opinions. He was ordained in the
Anglican church in 1762 and became vicar of Harpford with
Fenn-Ottery, Devon, in 1766. In 1768 he exchanged to the living of
Broadhembury, Devon.

He is chiefly known as a writer of [hymns](Hymn "Hymn") and poems,
including "Rock of Ages", and the collections entitled
*Poems on Sacred Subjects* (Dublin, 1759) and
*Psalms and Hymns for Public and Private Worship* (London, 1776).
His best prose work is the
*Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of the Church of England*
(London, 1774).

"Some comments by Wesley upon Toplady's presentation of Calvinism
led to a controversy which was carried on with much bitterness on
both sides. Toplady wrote a venomous Letter to Mr Wesley (1770),
and Wesley repeated his comments in *The Consequence Proved*
(1771), whereupon Toplady replied with increased acridity in
*More Work for Mr Wesley* (1772)." (*1911 Encyc*)

From 1775 to 1778, having obtained leave of non-residence at
Broadhembury, he lived in London, and ministered at a Calvinist
church in Orange Street.
