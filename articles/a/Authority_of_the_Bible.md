The **authority of the Bible** refers to the idea that the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") is normative for the
[church](Church "Church") in all speech, thought, and practice. In
other words, Scripture is the sole and final authority for
Christians in all matters of faith and practice.

The Bible is authoritative because its authority has been conferred
by [God](God "God"), and this is where all discussion of biblical
authority must begin. Thus, Scripture is a divine and human
instrument through which God has communicated and revealed his
authority. Most Evangelicals go further than this, insisting that
the Bible has a genuine authority "as the authentic embodiment of
God's self-disclosure... Some, like
[Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth"), allow this authority to be
bestowed by God while insisting that the Bible itself is
essentially a human document. Others - e.g.,
[Rudolf Bultmann](Rudolf_Bultmann "Rudolf Bultmann") and
[Paul Tillich](Paul_Tillich "Paul Tillich") - regard the Bible as a
fallible collection of religious writings on which the early church
arbitrarily imposed an authority that evangelical piety has
continued to uphold" (McDonald, p. 153-54).
