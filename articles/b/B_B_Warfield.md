B. B. Warfield
**Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield** (November 5, 1851 - February 16,
1921) was the principal of Princeton Seminary from 1887 to 1921. He
is considered the last great Princeton theologian before the split
in 1929 that formed Westminster Seminary and the Orthodox
Presbyterian Church.

## Education

Like many children born into a wealthy family, Warfield's childhood
education was private. Warfield entered Princeton University in
1868 and graduated in 1871 with high honors. After this he entered
Princeton Seminary in 1873, in order to train for Presbyterian
ministry. He graduated in 1876.

## Ministry

For a short time in 1876 he preached in Presbyterian churches in
Concord, Kentucky and Dayton, Ohio as a "supply pastor" - the
latter church calling him to be their ordained minister (which he
politely refused). In late 1876 Warfield and his new wife moved to
Germany where he studied under Ernst Luthardt and Franz Delitzsch.
Warfield was the assistant pastor of First Presbyterian Church in
Baltimore, Maryland for a short time. Then he became an instructor
at Western Theological Seminary, which is now called Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary. He was ordained on April 26, 1879.

In 1881 Warfield wrote a joint article with
[A. A. Hodge](A._A._Hodge "A. A. Hodge") on the
[inspiration of the Bible](Inspiration_of_the_Bible "Inspiration of the Bible").
It drew attention because of its scholarly and forceful defense of
the
[inerrancy of the Bible](Inerrancy_of_the_Bible "Inerrancy of the Bible").
In many of his writings, Warfield attempted to demonstrate that the
doctrine of Biblical inerrancy was simply orthodox Christian
teaching, and not merely a concept invented in the nineteenth
century. His passion was to refute the liberal element within
Presbyterianism and within Christianity at large.

Throughout his life, he continued to write books and articles,
which are still widely read today.

## Princeton

In 1887 Warfield was appointed to the
[Charles Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge") Chair at Princeton
Theological Seminary, where he succeeded Hodge's son A. A. Hodge.
Warfield remained there until his death. As the last conservative
successor to Hodge to live prior to the re-organization of
Princeton Seminary, Warfield is often regarded as the last of the
Princeton theologians.

## Scripture

During his tenure, his primary thrust (and that of the seminary)
was an authoritative view of the Bible. This view was held in
contrast to the
[emotionalism](index.php?title=Emotionalism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Emotionalism (page does not exist)")
of the revival movements, the rationalism of
[higher criticism](Higher_Criticism "Higher Criticism"), and the
[heterodox](Heterodox "Heterodox") teachings of various New
religious movements that were emerging. The seminary held fast to
the [Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") confessional tradition — that
is, it faithfully followed the
[Westminster Confession of Faith](Westminster_Confession_of_Faith "Westminster Confession of Faith").

Warfield believed that
[modernist theology](index.php?title=Modernist_theology&action=edit&redlink=1 "Modernist theology (page does not exist)")
was problematic, since it relied upon the thoughts of the Biblical
interpreter rather than upon the divine author of Scripture. He
therefore preached and believed the doctrine of
[sola scriptura](Sola_scriptura "Sola scriptura") — that the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") is God's inspired word and is sufficient for
the Christian to live his or her faith.

Much of Warfield's work centered upon the Bible's "inspiration" by
God — that while the authors of the Bible were men, the ultimate
author was God himself. The growing influence of modernist theology
denied that the Bible was inspired, and alternative theories of the
origin of the Christian faith were being explored.

Because of the Bible's style of writing, many modernist scholars
had pointed out the unquestionably "human" traits of certain
Biblical books. Grammatical and linguistic styles were contrasted
and compared, which proved beyond doubt that humans wrote the text
of the Bible. Unfortunately for Warfield and other conservatives,
some resulted in a belief that the Bible was therefore not written
by God at all, but by men. Warfield was instrumental in countering
this by arguing that the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit did
not lead to a form of "mechanical" inspiration (whereby the human
authors merely wrote down what God dictated to them) but one in
which the human author's intellect was fully able to express itself
linguistically, while at the same time being supervised by the Holy
Spirit to ensure its inspiration. This important argument is used
by many Reformed and Evangelical Christians today as part of their
understanding of what the Bible is.

## Calvinism

Underpinning much of Warfield's theology was his adherence to
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") as espoused by the Westminster
Confession of Faith. It is sometimes forgotten that, in his battles
against Modernism on the one hand, and against revivalism on the
other, that he was simply expressing the Reformed faith when
applied to certain situations.

It was Warfield's belief that the 16th century Reformers, as well
as the 17th century Confessional writers, were merely summarizing
the content and application of scripture. New revelations, whether
from the minds of celebrated scholars or popular revivalists, were
therefore inconsistent with these confessional statements (and
therefore inconsistent with Scripture). Throughout his ministry,
Warfield contended that modern world events and thinking could
never render such confessions obsolete. Such an attitude still
prevails today in many [Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") churches and
Christians who embrace Calvinism.

*Calvinism is just religion in its purity. We have only, therefore, to conceive of religion in its purity, and that is Calvinism*.
(Selected Shorter Writings, I, p. 389)
