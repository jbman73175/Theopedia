"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold,
I am with you always, to the end of the age" (Matthew 28:19-20;
ESV).

## Etymology

The English word *baptize* comes directly from the
[Greek](Greek "Greek") verb transliterated *baptizō*
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#907](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=907&version=nas)]*^).
Likewise the noun *baptism* is from the Greek noun transliterated
*baptisma*
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#908](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=908&version=nas)]*^).
Many believe that *baptizo* is properly translated "immerse" or
"dip" as into water. However others, based on the used of *baptizo*
in connection with dining couches in Mark 7:4 understand that the
term, by the time of the New Testament was used generically for
'washing' or 'cleansing' by different methods.

## John's baptism

"John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a
baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins." (Mark 1:4)

## Baptism of Jesus

"Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized
by him. John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be
baptized by you, and do you come to me?” But Jesus answered him,
“Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all
righteousness.” Then he consented. And when Jesus was baptized,
immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were
opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove
and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said,
“This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” - Matthew
3:13-17

## Christian baptism

Following his resurrection, Jesus instituted the sacrament of
Baptism in giving the "great commission," (Matthew 28:19). Paul
describes Christian baptism in Romans 6 as a union with the death
of Christ. "We were buried therefore with him by baptism into
death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by
the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life."
(Romans 6:4)

### Believer's baptism

Some denominations, such as [Baptists](Baptist "Baptist"), maintain
that the eligible candidate for baptism must profess a faith or
demonstrate a belief in the saving work of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")
on the cross. Consequently, these groups are among those who hold
to what is called a believer's baptism.

[Luke](Luke "Luke") writes of the birth of God's church in
[Acts](Book_of_Acts "Book of Acts") chapter 2, and it is in this
chapter where [Peter](Peter "Peter") preaches the saving power of
the gospel message in the present tense for the first time. When
those who might have had a hand in the death of Christ felt remorse
for their actions, they cried out to Peter what must they do. Peter
tells them to repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sins
(Acts 2:38). Luke records (in Acts 2:41) that those who received
the message were baptized, an indication that belief was involved.
The baptism of the Samaritans in Acts 8:12-13 also demonstrates
this link between belief and baptism.

Those who practice infant baptism generally do accept that
non-infants should only be baptized and admitted as members of the
church if they express faith in Christ. Believer's baptism
emphasizes that baptism should *only* be administered to those who
make a credible profession of faith.

### Infant baptism

*This is a **[section stub](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theopedia_sectionstubs "Category:Theopedia sectionstubs")**. Please edit it to add information.*
Many reformed believers regard baptism as a [Sign](Sign "Sign") and
a [Seal](Seal "Seal") of the covenant of grace. As such, they
baptize infants, not to make them members of God's church, but
because they *are* members of God's church. See

## Modes

Most denominations baptize by sprinkling or pouring, while
accepting the validity of immersion. Others, such as the Baptists,
insist that the only valid form is immersion. Some groups, notably
the Church of Christ, hold immersion as an essential piece of the
salvation process.
