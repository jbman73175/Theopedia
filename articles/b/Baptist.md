**Baptist** is a term referring to churches and denominations
within [Protestant](Protestantism "Protestantism") Christianity
that emphasize a
[believer's baptism](Believer's_baptism "Believer's baptism") by
full immersion which is performed after a profession of faith in
Christ as Lord and Savior. A congregational governance system gives
autonomy to individual local Baptist churches. Groups of Baptist
churches are sometimes associated in organizations for purposes of
missions and other common goals while retaining their local
autonomy.

Notable Baptist organizations include:

-   Southern Baptist Convention
-   General Association of Regular Baptist Churches
-   American Baptist Association

## Baptist origins

While Baptist churches are generally regarded as being within
Protestant Christianity, many see the origin of Baptist
distinctives predating the 16th century Protestant Reformation.
There is scholarly disagreement about the particulars of various
histories of the Baptist faith, but they generally fall into four
categories:^[[1]](#note-0)^

-   **An outgrowth of English Separatism**. The earliest Baptist
    church is traced back to 1609 in Amsterdam, with John Smyth as
    pastor and Thomas Helwys as a key lay leader. Representative
    Baptist scholars include late 19th through early 21st century
    Baptist historians such as William H. Whitsitt, Robert G. Torbet,
    Winthrop S. Hudson, William G. McLoughlin, Robert A. Baker, Leon
    McBeth, Douglas Weaver, Walter Shurden, and Bill Leonard.
-   **An outgrowth of English Separatism related to the Anabaptists.**
    According to this view, early Baptists were influenced by
    Anabaptists, e.g. the Dutch Mennonites. Representative Baptist
    historians include A. C. Underwood and William R. Estep.
-   **A continuity of Baptist forms of faith through the centuries**
    (though not a succession of organized Baptist churches). This view
    is represented by some historians of earlier generations such as
    Thomas Crosby (one of the earliest Baptist historians, he wrote in
    the early 1700s), A.H. Newman and David Benedict.
-   **An unbroken chain of Baptist churches back to N.T times**.
    Commonly referred to as "Landmarkism" (Baptist Successionism is a
    major component of "Landmark" views) or the "Trail of Blood" theory
    (J.M.Carroll authored a booklet by this name), this view declares
    that some churches that stood outside the influence of the Roman
    Catholic Church at various times in early and medieval history
    were, in actuality although not in name, Baptist churches.
