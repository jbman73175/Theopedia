The **Synod of Barmen** was a meeting of German
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") leaders at Barmen in the
Ruhr, in May 1934, to organize Protestant resistance to National
Socialism (Nazism). The synod was of decisive importance in the
development of the German Confessing Church. Representatives came
from established [Lutheran](Lutheranism "Lutheranism"),
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed"), and United churches, although some
of the church governments had already been captured by men loyal to
Adolf Hitler, and others had decided to limit their activities to
passive resistance. The Pastors' Emergency League, headed by Martin
Niemöller, was the backbone of the active resistance. Various lay
leaders and groups also rallied to the cause.

At Barmen the representatives adopted six articles, called the
**Theological Declaration of Barmen**, or the
**Barmen Declaration**, that defined the Christian opposition to
National Socialist ideology and practice. The major theological
influence was that of [Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth"). The
declaration was cast in the classical form of the great confessions
of faith, affirming major biblical teachings and condemning the
important [heresies](Heresy "Heresy") of those who were attempting
to accommodate Christianity to National Socialism. It is treated as
a confession by some denominations.
