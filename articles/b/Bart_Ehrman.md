Ehrman received his B.A. at Wheaton College in 1978, and later
attended Princeton Theological Seminary where he received an M.Div.
(1981) and a Ph.D. (1985). Having studied under
[Bruce Metzger](Bruce_Metzger "Bruce Metzger"), Ehrman also
specializes in the area of
[New Testament textual criticism](New_Testament_Textual_Criticism "New Testament Textual Criticism").

Although Ehrman had a strong background in Evangelical
Christianity, having attended both Moody Bible Institute and
Wheaton College, his personal beliefs have shifted over time.
Ehrman now considers himself an [agnostic](Agnostic "Agnostic").
Ehrman is a popularizer of the idea that the New Testament is
significantly corrupted, beyond reliability and is the author of
