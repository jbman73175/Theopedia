**Basil the Great** (ca. 330-379), was a bishop of Caesarea. Highly
regarded in the
[Eastern Orthodox Church](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church"),
he along with Gregory Nazianzus, and Basil's brother
[Gregory of Nyssa](Gregory_of_Nyssa "Gregory of Nyssa") are called
the
[Cappadocian Fathers](Cappadocian_Fathers "Cappadocian Fathers").

## Biographical sketch

Basil was born about 330 at Caesarea in Cappadocia into a wealthy
and pious family. His younger brothers, also prominent in the early
church, were
[Gregory of Nyssa](Gregory_of_Nyssa "Gregory of Nyssa") and Peter,
who became Bishop of Sebaste.

As a young man, he studied several years in Constantinople and at
Athens. There he had Gregory Nazianzus for a fellow student and
became friends with the future emperor Julian. Both men were deeply
influenced by Origen.

It was at Athens that he seriously began to think of religion, and
resolved to seek out the most famous hermit "saints" in Syria and
Arabia, in order to learn from them how to attain enthusiastic
piety and how to keep his body under submission by asceticism.
After he is found at the head of a convent near Arnesi in Pontus.
Eustathius of Sebaste had already labored in Pontus in behalf of
the anchoretic life, and Basil revered him on that account,
although they differed over dogmatic points, which gradually
separated these two men.

He was ordained presbyter of the Church at Caesarea in 365,
probably the result of the entreaties of his ecclesiastical
superiors, who wished to use his talents against the Arians, who
were numerous in that part of the country and were favored by the
Arian emperor, Valens, who then reigned in Constantinople.

In 370 Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, died, and Basil was chosen to
succeed him. It was here that his talents were called into action.
With great fervor, he resisted the emperor Valens, who strove to
introduce [Arianism](Arianism "Arianism") into his diocese. Basil
so impressed the emperor that, although inclined to banish the
intractable bishop, he left him unmolested.

To save the Church from Arianism, Basil entered into connections
with the West, and with the help of
[Athanasius](Athanasius "Athanasius"), he tried to overcome its
distrustful attitude toward the *Homoiousians*. On the other hand,
Basil was grievously offended by the extreme adherents of
*Homoousianism*, who seemed to him to be reviving the
[Sabellian heresy](Sabellianism "Sabellianism").

He did not live to see the end of the unhappy factional
disturbances and the eventual success of his efforts in behalf of
Rome and the East. He suffered from liver illness and his excessive
asceticism seems to have hastened him to an early death.

## Writings

The principal theological writings of Basil are his
*De Spiritu Sancto*, appealing to Scripture and early Christian
tradition to prove the divinity of the Holy Spirit, and his
*Refutation of the Apology of the Impious Eunomius*, written in 363
or 364, three books against Eunomius of Cyzicus, the chief exponent
of Anomoian Arianism. The first three books of the *Refutation* are
his work; the fourth and fifth books that are usually included to
do not belong to Basil, or to Apollinaris of Laodicea, but probably
to Didymus of Alexandria.

He was a famous preacher, and many of his homilies and an
exposition of the psalter have been preserved.

His ascetic tendencies are exhibited in the *Moralia and Regulae*,
ethical manuals for use in the world and the cloister,
respectively. It is in the ethical manuals and moral sermons that
the practical aspects of his theoretical theology are illustrated.

His three hundred letters reveal a rich and observant nature,
which, despite the troubles of ill-health and ecclesiastical
unrest, remained optimistic, tender and even playful. His principal
efforts as a reformer were directed towards the improvement of the
liturgy, and the reformation of the monastic orders of the East.

All his works, and a few spuriously attributed to him, are
available in the Patrologia Graeca, which includes Latin
translations of varying quality. No critical edition is yet
available.
