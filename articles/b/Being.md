**Being** is the quality or state of having existence. Specifically
this is the gerund form of the verb *to be* which functions as a
substantive (noun).

As a noun, *being* may refer to either a thing or a substance. The
latter is really our concern. A being in this sense is something
that is generally living, or if not living, then conscious (certain
substances may be conscious, but not living in an embodied state,
and some substances may be living—plants, for example—but not
conscious). A substance is the owner and unifier of properties,
parts, and capacities. A being remains absolutely the same through
law-like, repeatable change to reach a final stage if change is
part of its [nature](Nature "Nature"). Each being or substance has
a nature or secondary substance to it. For example, John Doe is a
particular being with a human nature. 'Oneness in nature' does not
entail 'oneness in being'. John, Joe, and Jack are one in their
nature (*i.e.*, they are all human), but they are not one in their
being (i.e., they are all separate human beings). The members of
the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") are not only one in the former
sense, they are one in the latter sense (i.e., they are all
inseparably united as one being).
