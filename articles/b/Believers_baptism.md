**Believer's baptism** is the [Christian](Christian "Christian")
practice of [baptism](Baptism "Baptism") in which the participant
publicly professes faith in
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") as personal Lord and
Savior, and as admission into a local community of faith.
Believer’s baptism has also been understood as a sign of obedience
to Christ (Matt. 28:19-20). Believer's baptism by *immersion* is
more common than by *affusion* or *aspersion*. It is practiced by
many Protestant churches, especially those with Baptist and
Anabaptist (literally, rebaptizer) traditions, and their
theological relatives. It is also referred to as credo-baptism,
from the Latin word *credo*, meaning *I believe*. Churches and
denominations that practice believer's baptism do so in contrast to
denominations that practice
[Infant baptism](Infant_baptism "Infant baptism") (or
paedo-baptism, from the Greek word *paido* meaning *child* or
*infant*). A key concept in believer's baptism is that a credible
profession of faith must be given by the recipient before baptism.

## History

When a person professes Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, the new
Christian is typically baptized. Baptism is an act of applying
water to an object; in the meaning of the Greek term
*baptizo*,^[[1]](#note-Dau)^ "baptism" means to dip or immerse a
person into water for religious reasons. Another word *(ekcheo)* is
used for pouring, leading to a conclusion that *baptizo* does not
mean pour. "…There is thus no doubt that early in the 2nd century
some Christians felt baptism was so important that, when the real
baptism (immersion) could not be performed because of lack of
water, pouring might be used in its place."^[[1]](#note-Dau)^ In
the opening gospel stories of the New Testament, John the Baptist
baptized his disciples at Bethany beyond Jordan where Jesus met
John and was baptized by him (John 1:25-34).

Scholars report that forms of baptism or ritual cleansing were
practiced by Jewish sects at the time of Christ, so baptism in some
form preexisted the Christian movement.^[[2]](#note-Brackney)^

Among the earliest Christians, water baptism became a sign of
identification^[[3]](#note-0)^ with the Christian faith and
community.^[[4]](#note-1)^ Instructed to go and teach the nations,
the disciples were also told to baptize them in the name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Peter called on his
listeners "to repent and be baptized" (Acts 2:38–41). Philip
baptized an Ethiopian (Acts 8:26–38), and Paul’s converts at
Philippi were baptized following their conversions (Acts 16:11–16;
31–34). Clearly, baptism was an important experience in being
faithful to Christ in the New Testament
churches.^[[5]](#note-GRM)^^p.68^

In the next several centuries, the practice of baptism underwent
some important changes. In the third century, leaders of the Church
began to teach that infant baptism was acceptable. By the fourth
century, baptism had become a required
sacrament^[[6]](#note-Cullman)^ of the Church, administered
according to a stated rite, and given to infants.^[[7]](#note-2)^

Throughout the Middle Ages, the Christian Church (East and West)
continued to stress baptism at the beginning of life. With the use
of an elaborate ritual, priests baptized infants, and upon
nomination of the parents, proclaimed each child’s Christian name.
Thus, baptism had both a theological and social importance that the
early church had not recognized.^[[2]](#note-Brackney)^

In the Reformation, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Huldreich Zwingli,
and others gave less emphasis to the mystical elements of the
sacrament of baptism. In keeping with medieval tradition, the
terminology of "sacrament" was retained,^[[6]](#note-Cullman)^
though with more stress on the role of parents and, later in a
child’s development, individual accountability for personal
faith.^[[5]](#note-GRM)^

The radical reformers called "Anabaptists" insisted upon a
"rebaptism" as believers.^[[5]](#note-GRM)^ That restored some of
the original meaning of baptism from the primitive New Testament
context. The Anabaptists believed that becoming a Christian
disciple was a radical step of separation from one’s past that
required in baptism an act of high symbolism before the Christian
community. Anabaptists stand historically just before
Baptists.^[[2]](#note-Brackney)^

In major studies in the past two centuries, many Christians have
come to the position on believer’s baptism by immersion as
consistent with the ancient churches. While the possibility that
infant baptism was also practiced in the apostolic age cannot be
excluded, baptism upon personal profession of faith is the most
clearly attested pattern in the New Testament
documents.^[[8]](#note-3)^

## Theology

Christians who practice believer's baptism believe that saving
grace comes from God by the recipient's faith alone. Thus they
consider that it cannot be imparted or transferred from one person
to another (such as from parent to child) by sacraments such as
baptism.

Most denominations practicing believer's baptism do not consider
baptism to have any saving effect, but rather see it as a public
expression of one's faith in Christ. To them it is a *symbolic*
representation of the inner conversion of the person being
baptized. Therefore, having no saving grace according to their
theology, baptism usually would not be termed a "sacrament," but
rather an "ordinance." They understand the baptism by immersion to
depict the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Some
other Christian groups, such as the Churches of Christ, hold
baptism to have salvific value, hence a prerequisite for salvation.
While such groups do not describe baptism as a "sacrament", their
view of it can legitimately be described as "sacramental."

Because Jesus commanded that baptism should be conducted to the end
of the age, baptism becomes a seal of the promise that Christ will
return to claim his people (Matt. 28:20).

## Biblical basis

The biblical basis of believer's baptism centers around the baptism
of [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") by
[John the Baptist](John_the_Baptist "John the Baptist") (Matt.
3:13-17, Mark 1:9-11, Luke 3:21-22, John 1:29-34) and several other
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") passages:

-   "...having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him
    through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the
    dead." (Col. 2:11-12, NIV)
-   "...this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also- not
    the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good
    conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of
    [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ")." (1 Pe. 3:21)
-   "^37^Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart,
    and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brethren, what
    shall we do?" ^38^And Peter said to them, "Repent, and let each of
    you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of
    your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit...."
    ^41^So then, those who had received his word were baptized; and
    there were added that day about three thousand souls." (Acts
    2:37-38, 41)

## Age of accountability

Believer's baptism is administered only to persons who have passed
the age of accountability or reason, which is based upon
interpretation of the New Testament, and examples therein, that
only believers should be baptized. Some individuals never reach
this stage regardless of age, possibly because of a developmental
challenge or other factor that prevents them from making a personal
choice. Sometimes the pastor or church leader will determine the
believer's understanding and conviction through personal
interviews. In the case of a minor, parents' permission is usually
sought.

## Practice

Most denominations that practice believer's baptism also specify
the mode of baptism, generally preferring **immersion** (complete
lowering beneath the surface of a body of water) over **affusion**
(water sprinkled or poured over the candidate). In the case of
physical disability or inability to be totally submerged under
water, the pouring of water upon the baptismal candidate is
acceptable to some.

Some baptize only in "living waters"─active or flowing waters as in
a stream, lake, or ocean (John 5:1-7). Others have accommodated
themselves to indoor facilities such as a baptismal pool, usually
with heated water. Indoor or outdoor swimming pools also are
sometimes used.

The words of the administrator are to be meaningful, but typically
are not specifically prescribed by the denomination. An example of
words that are often used in believer's baptism: "I baptize you in
the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Buried in the
likeness of the burial of Christ, and raised in the likeness of His
resurrection." By no means is this phraseology standard, not even
with a particular denomination. In most all evangelical and
reformed churches, being Trinitarian in their beliefs, it is
considered essential that the person be baptized specifically in
the name of the Trinity.

Some denominations consider believer's baptism to be a prerequisite
to full church membership. Persons who wish to become part of the
church must undergo believer's baptism in that local body, or
another body whose baptism the local body honors. Typically, local
churches will honor the believer's baptism of another church if
that tradition uses the same *mode* of baptism, teaches it to have
the same symbolic *meaning,* and administers it according to
Trinitarian *belief.*

Believer's baptism is inextricably tied to mission as it vividly
portrays the gospel and fulfills Jesus’ Great Commission for all
true disciples. Most importantly, baptism cannot be separated from
one’s doctrine of Christ, since Christ himself was baptized and his
redemptive work is depicted in baptism by immersion as a new
relationship in Christ which all believers enjoy.

In recent years under the influence of the charismatic movement,
significant minorities of Christians who have been baptized with
water then, as a separate act, experience a baptism with (in or by)
the Holy Spirit. This has produced manifestations like prophesying
and speaking in spiritual languages (Acts 19:2-6).
