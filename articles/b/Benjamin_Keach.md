Benjamin Keach
**Benjamin Keach** (1640-1704) was an influential leader among 17th
century [Particular Baptists](Strict_Baptist "Strict Baptist"). As
a prominent nonconformist leader and a prolific writer, he helped
shape the theological development of the Particular Baptists as
they struggled through persecution and finally emerged under legal
toleration near the end of that century. Keach originated from
Buckinghamshire and worked as a Tailor. He was baptized at the age
of 15 and began preaching at 18. He was the minister of the
congregation at Winslow before moving in 1668 to the church at
Horsleydown, Southwark where he remained as pastor for 36 years. It
was as representative of this church that Keach went to the 1689
General Assembly and subscribed to the
[London Baptist Confession of Faith](London_Baptist_Confession_of_1689 "London Baptist Confession of 1689").

He is attributed with the writing of a Catechism commonly known as
"Keach's Catechism", although it is most likely that the original
was compiled by William Collins. It was originally published to
clarify the theology of the Second London Baptist Confession that
was written in 1677 and published in 1689.

Keach is also known for his introduction of hymns into the worship
service of his congregation at Horsleydown around 1673. This
decision eventually sparked a very public discourse on whether or
not singing was appropriate in worship, and if so, on the types of
song that God found acceptable.
