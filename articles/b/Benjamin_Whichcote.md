**Benjamin Whichcote** (1609-83) was a British philosopher and
liberal theologian in the established church and friend of the
philosopher [John Locke](John_Locke "John Locke"). Whichcote is
usually considered to be the founding father of Cambridge
Platonism, which spawned a group of mid-17th century Cambridge
philosophers who attempted to reconcile Christian ethics with
Renaissance humanism, religion with early modern science, and faith
with rationality.^[[1]](#note-0)^^[[2]](#note-1)^ Whichcote and the
Cambridge Platonists were opponents of those who held to orthodox
Calvinism, specifically the doctrines of
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination") and
[total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity").^[[3]](#note-2)^
