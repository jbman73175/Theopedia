Bernard Ramm
**Bernard L. Ramm** (1916-1992) born in Butte, Montana was a
[Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") [theologian](Theologian "Theologian")
and [apologist](Apologetics "Apologetics") within the broad
[Evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") tradition. He wrote
prolifically on topics concerned with biblical

Christology, and apologetics.

Ramm's education included a B.A. University of Washington, B.D.

University of Southern California. He also undertook additional
studies at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Basel,
Switzerland, and the Near Eastern School of Theology, Beirut,
Lebanon.

## Career

Ramm's academic teaching career began in 1943 when he joined the
faculty at the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (now Biola
University, La Mirada, California). He became Professor of
Philosophy at Bethel College and Seminary, and then Professor of
Religion at Baylor University, Texas. Most of his academic teaching
was conducted at the American Baptist Seminary of the West at
Covina, California, where he taught between 1958-74 and again from
1978-86. At that seminary he held the post of Professor of
Systematic Theology.
