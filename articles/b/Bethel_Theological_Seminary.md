**Bethel Seminary** is an evangelical seminary founded by John
Alexis Edgren in 1871 in Chicago where for fifty years it was the
Swedish Department of the University of Chicago Divinity School. In
1914, the seminary relocated to St. Paul under the aegis of the
Swedish Baptists (later known as the Baptist General Conference and
most recently as Converge Worldwide). Swedish pietism has deeply
influenced the school's development. The educational philosophy of
the seminary is constantly being refined by the question: "What
kind of leadership does the 21st century church need?" The
curriculum seeks to address 1) theological wisdom, 2) personal and
spiritual wholeness and 3) leadership ability.

In 1977 the seminary established a campus in San Diego, CA because
of the ethnic diversity and spiritual opportunities. In 1995,
Bethel was invited to engage in a management agreement with the
Seminary of the East, founded by Conservative Baptists in the
Northeast Corridor. In 2002, the four sites of the Seminary of the
East (Philadelphia,PA; Auburn, MA; Flushing, Queens NY; Metro
Washington, D.C.) formally became an integral part of Bethel
Seminary.

As with most other seminaries, Bethel provides graduate theological
education for students living in the metro Twin Cities and San
Diego or who have temporarily located there to pursue an education.
Degree programs on the East Coast are all in a modular format and
utilize local ministry mentors. The seminary also provides a SemPM
"delivery system" for students living within 150 miles of the St.
Paul campus who come to campus once a week. Bethel pioneered a
third "delivery system" for persons already engaged in ministry.
The InMinistry degree program serves students around the world.

The seminary is affiliated with Converge Worldwide (Baptist General
Conference) although it serves students from more than 50
denominations. The seminary offers 10 graduate degrees and 11
certificate programs. The seminary is accredited by the Association
of Theological Schools and by the Higher Learning Commission of the
North central Association of Colleges and Schools.
