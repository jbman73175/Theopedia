The **Bible** is the sacred book of
[Christianity](Christianity "Christianity"), a collection of
ancient writings [inspired](Inspiration "Inspiration") by
[God](God "God") which comprise the sixty-six books of both the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") and the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"). Christians often
refer to the Bible as "Scripture", "the Scriptures" or "Holy
Scripture" indicating its authority.

### [Apocrypha](Apocrypha "Apocrypha")

Some Protestant Bibles, e.g. some editions of the
[King James](King_James_Version "King James Version") version, have
a section between the Old and New Testaments labelled
[Apocrypha](Apocrypha "Apocrypha") containing Jewish
inter-testamental writings. In general, these books are not
considered to be [canonical](Canon "Canon") by
[Protestant](Protestantism "Protestantism") denominations, but are
presented here for reference. 1 Esdras - 2 Esdras - Tobit - Judith
- Rest of Esther - Wisdom - Ecclesiasticus (also known as Sirach) -
Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremy - Song of the Three Children -
Story of Susanna - The Idol Bel and the Dragon - Prayer of Manasses
- 1 Maccabees - 2 Maccabees - 3 Maccabees - 4 Maccabees - Psalm
151

## Revelation of God

"Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers
by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his
Son" (Heb. 1:1-2a, [ESV](ESV "ESV")). While God revealed himself
through prophets, apostles, and most fully in his
[Son](Jesus "Jesus"), his revelation has been recorded and
preserved in the Bible.

*See main page: [Revelation of God](Revelation_of_God "Revelation of God")*
## Development of the canon

The development of the canon deals with how the Bible came to be.
"God determined the canon of Scripture by co-authoring it. Man
recognized what God had revealed and accepted the canon of
Scripture for what it was, the very Word of God. A book is not the
Word of God because it was accepted by the people, it was accepted
by the people because it was the Word of God. This is an important
distinction. The canon was not formed by a council of men. It did
not evolve over the years. God led men to discover what He had
authored."
[[1]](http://www.valleybible.net/resources/AdultEducationClasses/Doctrine/Bibliology/canonicity.shtml)

*See main page: [Development of the canon](Development_of_the_canon "Development of the canon")*
## Transmission

"After the original biblical text was penned by the authors (or by
the secretary of the author, cf. Romans 16:22), it was copied for
the purpose of circulating the writing to God's people. This
process of copying is known as transmission."
[[2]](http://www.valleybible.net/resources/AdultEducationClasses/Doctrine/Bibliology/transmission.shtml)

*See main page: [Transmission of the Bible](Transmission_of_the_Bible "Transmission of the Bible")*
## Historicity

The historicity of the Old Testament seeks to establish the
historical trustworthiness of the Old Testament. This is based on
two factors: the reliability of the Old Testament manuscripts, and
the reliability of those who were involved with writing and putting
the OT together.

*See main page: [Historicity of the Old Testament](Historicity_of_the_Old_Testament "Historicity of the Old Testament") and [Historicity of the New Testament](Historicity_of_the_New_Testament "Historicity of the New Testament")*
## Biblical archaeology

*See main page: [Biblical archaeology](Biblical_archaeology "Biblical archaeology")*
## Authority

Throughout history, a major contention has been the authority of
Scripture. In medieval times, the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
made
[church tradition](index.php?title=Tradition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Tradition (page does not exist)")
as authoritative as the Bible and greatly restricted access to the
Bible. The Reformation brought a renewed emphasis on the fact that
Scripture is the "only rule of faith and practice."

*This is a **[section stub](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theopedia_sectionstubs "Category:Theopedia sectionstubs")**. Please edit it to add information.*
*See main page: [Authority of the Bible](Authority_of_the_Bible "Authority of the Bible")*
## Inspiration

Inspiration establishes that the Bible is not only a human but also
a divine product. In other words, Scripture is divinely *inspired*
in that God actively worked through the process and had his hand in
the outcome of what Scripture would say. Inspired Scripture is
simply written revelation. "Scripture is not only man's word, but
also, and equally God's word, spoken through man's lips or written
with man's pen" ([J.I. Packer](J.I._Packer "J.I. Packer"),
*The Origin of the Bible*, p. 31).

*See main page: [Inspiration of the Bible](Inspiration_of_the_Bible "Inspiration of the Bible")*
## Inerrancy

"Inerrancy is the view that when all the facts become known, they
will demonstrate that the Bible *in its original autographs* and
correctly interpreted is entirely true and never false in all it
affirms, whether that relates to doctrines or ethics or to the
social, physical, or life sciences" (Evangelical Dictionary of
Theology, p. 156). The conservative evangelical stance on inerrancy
was most recently and thoroughly articulated in 1978 in the
[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy](Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy "Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy").

*See main page: [Inerrancy of the Bible](Inerrancy_of_the_Bible "Inerrancy of the Bible")*
## Translation

*This is a **[section stub](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theopedia_sectionstubs "Category:Theopedia sectionstubs")**. Please edit it to add information.*
*See main page: [Translation of the Bible](Translation_of_the_Bible "Translation of the Bible")*
## Interpretation

The interpretation of the bible, also called "hermeneutics",
involves establishing the principles for our interpretation and
understanding of any part of the Bible, and then interpreting it so
its message is made clear to the reader or listener. It inevitably
involves [exegesis](Exegesis "Exegesis"), which is the process of
examining the actual biblical text as it came from each writer and
to discover how they communicated God's truth.

*See main page: [Interpretation of the Bible](Interpretation_of_the_Bible "Interpretation of the Bible")*
## Clarity

The "meanings of the text can be clear to the ordinary reader,
[and] God uses the text of the Bible to communicate His person and
will." [[3]](http://www.foclnews.org/v0501.htm) Upon this
foundation, Christians encourage the personal reading of the Bible,
and extend a great deal of effort to make it available to those who
do not yet have it in their possession.

*See main page: [Clarity of Scripture](Clarity_of_Scripture "Clarity of Scripture")*
## Sufficiency

*[Sola Scriptura](Five_Solas "Five Solas")* is the teaching that
Scripture is the Church's only infallible and sufficient rule for
deciding issues of faith and practices that involve doctrines.
While the Bible does not contain all knowledge, it does contain
that which is necessary for salvation. Indeed, if something is not
found in Scripture, it is not binding upon the believer. This is
not to say, however, that there is a chapter and verse directly
prohibiting every error in doctrine or conduct, since many
applications to doctrine and conduct are applications of scriptural
principles. For example, the New Testament gives little direct
information about church government.
