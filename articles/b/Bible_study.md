## Styles of study

### Devotional

The focus of study is on life-application. Scripture is often
applied to real-life situations, and authors of devotional studies
often include personal stories related to a particular concept. The
goal of these studies are to produce meaningful life change from an
understanding of Scripture.

### Technical

Often, original [Greek](Greek "Greek") or [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew")
texts are involved. Raw information derived from these studies may
appear uninteresting, but when applied to other styles of study,
prove to be quite useful and sometimes required for interpretation
of complex passages.

### Topical

Often included as part of a
[systematic theology](Systematic_theology "Systematic theology"),
topical bible studies may or may not include life application, but
almost always focus on factual items that can be read directly or
synthesized from other information (with proper understanding, see
Technical above), including other sections of Scripture. This is
where most [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") is formed.

### Historical

A study of historical events as written in the Bible. These studies
may also include other primary sources outside of the Bible, for
example, archaeological records or scientific papers written on
ancient civilization. Like technical studies, these can often
appear to be dry, but like the Technical studies, historical
context can sometimes be vital for proper interpretation of a
passage.

### Block-reading

An attempt at simply reading a large portion of Scripture.
Depending on one's level of focus and the style of writing used in
a particular book being studied, this may or may not be an
interesting approach to Scripture. However, the possibilities of
personal application as well as use in other studies makes this
style of study invaluable.

Depending on one's personal preferences, one may perform study in a
variety of ways. Here are a few of the most popular:

Written guide: Often used in topical and devotional study, a
pre-written guide is used along with whatever is being studied.
Writers insights are presented along with references to specific
sections of Scripture, usually followed by a prompt for the
reader(s) to write/discuss his or her thoughts, insights or
feelings.

### Free-form

The reader(s) simply chooses a style and subject, and begins
reading. The effectiveness of this style depends on one's
particular level of interest and focus.

### Independent

Study is taken alone. This may be free-form or guided, depending on
one's personal preferences.

### Small-group

Members participate in either a free-form or guided discussion of a
particular topic. For devotional studies, additional benefits might
occur, such as
[accountability groups](index.php?title=Accountability_group&action=edit&redlink=1 "Accountability group (page does not exist)").
Often there is a leader who makes preparations before every study
session.

### Large-group (aka Sermon)

One person delivers a prepared message to a large group of people.
This is often the preferred method of church operation, as a large
number of small groups may be hard to manage and keep all on one
topic. Usually pastors deliver a sermon, however most churches may
often allow guest speakers (for example, pastors from other
churches) and some even allow local members of the congregation to
speak.
