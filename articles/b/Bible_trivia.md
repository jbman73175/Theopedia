## Shakespeare and Psalm 46

It is believed that Shakespeare was 46 around the time that the
[King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version") of
the Bible was written. In Psalms 46, the 46th word from the first
word is shake and the 46th word from the last word is spear (Selah
is not considered one of the words).
