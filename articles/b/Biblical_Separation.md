**Biblical Separation** is the Scriptural doctrine tied closely to
the doctrines of Sanctification and Evangelism. It, in essence,
teaches that Christians are to be in the world, but not of the
world. In other words, we are to be friends with all who reside
with us in the world, but yet we are not to participate in those
things (actions, words, ideas/philosophies) which are contrary to
the character of God (i.e., sinful; Romans 3:23; 1 John 3:4). On
the one hand, we are not simply to be lights to the world in a
passive sense, but in a very real active sense we are to let our
light so shine **before** men in such a way that they may **see**
our good works (Matthew 5:16). On the other hand, however, we are
to *not* to love the world (its system that is set up in opposition
against God; 1 John 2:15-16), conform ourselves to it (Rom. 12:2)
nor participate in its evil practices, but rather, even expose them
(Ephesians 5:11).
