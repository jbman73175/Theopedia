**Biblical and theological dictionaries** have become increasingly
available since the second half of the twentieth century and are
important for anyone involved in biblical and theological studies.
Due to the booming work of scholarship it has become nearly
impossible to keep up with various fields of study. Thus, these
dictionaries have become vital resources which provide helpful
summaries of important subjects (movements, individuals, doctrines,
etc.) and often provide a preliminary bibliography. However, the
limit of these resources lay in their time of publication. That is,
each dictionary provides information and tools which often
represent concerns and movements of its time.
