**Biblical criticism** is an umbrella term covering various
techniques for applying literary *historical-critical* methods in
analyzing and studying the [Bible](Bible "Bible") and its textual
content. The word "criticism" is not to be taken in the negative
sense of attempting to denigrate the Bible, although this motive is
found in its history. Technically, biblical criticism simply refers
to the scholarly approach of studying, evaluating and critically
assessing the Bible as literature in order to understand it
better.

Originally synonymous with higher criticism, the term
*biblical criticism* is now seen to encompass the whole spectrum of
critical methods for applying general literary historical
principles to evaluate the Bible and its text.

**Higher criticism**, arising from 19th century European
[rationalism](Rationalism "Rationalism"), generally takes a secular
approach asking questions regarding the origin and composition of
the text, including when and where it originated, how, why, by
whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced, what
influences were at work in its production, and what original oral
or written sources may have been used in its composition; and the
message of the text as expressed in its language, including the
meaning of the words as well as the way in which they are arranged
in meaningful forms of expression. The principles of higher
criticism are based on reason rather than revelation and are also
speculative by nature.

**Lower criticism**, also called **Textual criticism**, generally
asks questions having to do with the preservation and transmission
of the biblical text, including in what manuscripts the text has
been preserved, their date, setting, and relationship to each
other, and therefore what is the most reliable form of the text. In
this sense, it is virtually synonymous with what is called Textual
Criticism.

**Statistical criticism**, uses mathematical and statistical
methods to sift through variant readings. Instead of using
manuscript families and the Bible critic's own reason, this type of
criticism puts the various texts into a statistical formula to
derive its text.

## Higher criticism

The higher critical methods described below grew out of a German
school of Biblical studies in the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries. Important names in the development of higher
criticism include
[Friedrich Schleiermacher](Friedrich_Schleiermacher "Friedrich Schleiermacher")
(1768–1834), Ludwig Feuerbach (1804–1872) and David Friedrich
Strauss (1808–1874); the origins of higher criticism are deeply
intertwined with rationalism and
[naturalism](Naturalism "Naturalism"). The concepts and methods
behind higher criticism were carried from Germany across Europe,
finding homes in the United Kingdom and France, among liberal
[Anglicans](Anglican "Anglican") and
[Catholics](Catholic "Catholic") respectively. In later times,
higher critical methods were deployed in conjunction with the
contemporary philosophical trends to de-historicize Scripture.

This history of applying critical methods in an attempt to pull
down Scripture has meant that the value of higher criticial methods
has been, and still is, a matter of controversy among evangelicals.
There are some who argue that entire field is irretrievably liberal
and secular. For instance, when challenged that he was "throwing
the baby out with the bathwater" in rejecting higher critical
methods, James Montgomery replied "The difference is, you think
there's a baby there, and I don't." ^[[1]](#note-0)^
[Geisler](Norman_Geisler "Norman Geisler") argues that evangelicals
have been bedeviled by the offspring of methodological naturalism
in biblical criticism largely through redaction criticism.
^[[2]](#note-1)^

Nevertheless, there are also evangelicals who argue that the higher
critical methods study texts of human origin, and that
evangelicals, believing that the Bible has origins both human and
divine, can appropriately use the higher critical methods. For
instance, [Osborne](Grant_Osborne "Grant Osborne") writes,

> [higher critical methods] become enemies of the veracity of
> Scripture only when imbibed with the radical skepticism of negative
> criticism. When utilized under the aegis of an inerrant Scripture,
> they become positive, helpful tools. ^[[3]](#note-2)^

and reports that
> [Carl F. H. Henry](Carl_F._H._Henry "Carl F. H. Henry") says, "What
> is objectionable is not the historical-critical method, but rather
> the alien presuppositions to which neo-protestant scholars subject
> it." When it is "freed from the arbitrary assumptions of critics,"
> it becomes "highly serviceable as a disciplined investigative
> approach to past historical events." ^[[4]](#note-3)^

As Osborne, and indeed any evangelical proponent of higher
criticism, will allow, the higher critical methods are as dangerous
when allied to skepticism as they are helpful when allied to
reverence; for this reason, it is entirely appropriate to exercise
caution in the application of higher critical tools and the reading
of higher critics, even while accepting the value of their work.

### Historical criticism

Historical Criticism seeks to find the particular historical
setting or perhaps, if developed over time, one or more historical
settings. A biblical writing may be said to have a history of its
own, which includes its time and place of composition, the
circumstances in which it was produced or written, its author or
authors, how it came to be written, and the audience(s) to which it
was addressed. Dating a composition is often crucial in determining
the history of a text. References to events in the text itself
sometimes aid this process. In addition, external resources such as
archaeological evidence or non-biblical writings from the same
period are utilized.

### Literary criticism

Literary Criticism is primarily concerned with the Bible's literary
forms, structures and themes. How does it function to accomplish
its purpose? This involves identifying the type and use of the
various literary genre such as narrative, poetic, apocalyptic,
oratorical, wisdom, epistolary, etc. It includes evaluating the
language of a text, looking at the words and their various meanings
or shades of meaning and the patterns of meaning ranging from
phrases to sentences, paragraphs, chapters, and sections. To
analyze these, it is often necessary to examine the grammar of the
original language, which includes the arrangement of words and how
their forms are changed (inflection or accidence).

### Source criticism

One aspect of *historical criticism*, Source criticism is
particularly concerned with identifying potential sources and
precursors of the text we have now. An example of the use of source
criticism is the famous Pentateuch division between source J and E.
They are supposedly distinguishable by the use of the terms Yahweh
and Elohim. Two additional sources were later proposed as P for
priestly, and D for Deuteronomic. Hence the
[JEDP theory](JEDP_theory "JEDP theory") of authorship advocated by
German scholar, Julius Wellhausen (1844-1918).

### Form criticism

Form Criticism, a hybrid of *historical* and *literary criticism*,
is concerned with what oral precursors (stories, legends, myths,
etc.) are discernable behind the text. What was its life-setting
and genre? It begins with the recognition that a portion of a text
may have a history of its own, independent of the larger work in
which it is located. Reconstructing this process of development is
known as tradition history. This is possible because in some
instances the same biblical text occurs in different parts of the
Bible in different forms. For example, Hermann Gunkel (1862-1932),
*The Psalms, a Form-Critical Introduction*. See also, Sigmund
Mowinkel (1884-1965), *Prophecy and Tradition* (Oslo, 1946).

### Tradition criticism

Tradition Criticism, often seen as part of *Source criticism*,
seeks to postulate the process by which religious tradition was
passed down and changed through the time-history of the biblical
writings.

### Redaction criticism

Redaction Criticism is concerned with when and by what process (of
collecting and editing) did a particular section or book of the
Bible reach its final literary form. The redaction critic's task is
to analyze the individual instances where the editor/author may
have redacted an earlier text or tradition, assess the overall
significance of such changes, and interpret these in the light of
the editor's literary and theological purpose.

Originally, redaction criticism was restricted to the synoptic
gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), but it has been applied to other
areas of Scripture. Norman Perrin states, "The prime requisite for
redaction criticism is the ability to trace the form and content of
material used by the author concerned or in some way to determine
the nature and extent of his activity in collecting and creating,
as well as in arranging, editing, and composing." ^[[5]](#note-4)^

## Textual criticism, or Lower criticism

Greek Manuscript
Sometimes *textual criticism* is referred to as "lower criticism,"
as opposed to other fields of inquiry concerning the text, called
"higher criticism." It is "lower" not because it is less important
but because it is the discipline and study of the actual wording of
Scripture, as opposed to the study of the sources and literary
methods employed by the biblical authors.

The purpose of textual criticism is to establish the original
wording or form of the biblical text as penned in the autographs,
so far as this is possible. In dealing with ancient manuscripts,
there is difficulty in determining what an author actually wrote
for several reasons:

-   The original autographs no longer exist, so extant (known,
    existing) copies must be used to make a determination.
-   Various copies of surviving ancient manuscripts differ in their
    actual wording due to scribal errors that crept in through the
    process of copying and re-copying.
-   Many manuscripts only contain incomplete sections of the
    original.
-   Thousands of extant manuscripts (of varying textual content)
    dating from the 3rd century to the 16th century must be considered.
-   Manuscript evidence suggests different textual traditions that
    developed geographically over time, which must also be factored
    into the process.

"It is the task of textual criticism to collect and study these
various writings in which a text has been preserved, determine the
changes that have occurred in the wording and arrangement of the
text, assess the significance of such changes, and restore, if
possible, the original wording or form of the text. If this is not
possible, one must decide on the best or most reliable wording and
try to account for the historical process through which the text
has been changed. In every case, textual criticism seeks to
establish a reliable text that can serve as the basis for serious
study and reflection," (Achtemier, *Harper's Bible Dictionary*).

## Statistical criticism

There are different approaches to statistical criticism as
discussed by Bruce Metzger in *The Text of the New Testament*
(Oxford, 1968), pp. 163-169. One of the more interesting approaches
was developed by Vinton A. Dearing, *A Manual of Textual Analysis*
(Berkley, 1959). Dearing basically combined two other statistical
approaches (the principle of mediators , and calculus) to create
his method. The principle of mediators developed by Quentin takes
three texts and makes one out of the three the mediator. The other
two texts will not have a common deviation against the median text.
The problem with this method is that it only works well when
dealing with a small number of texts since it works in groups of
threes'. The calculus method developed by Greg reveals possible
relationships within given texts through his algorithm. The
principle of simplicity also comes in when weighing the assumptions
to be applied if more than one interpretation is possible.
