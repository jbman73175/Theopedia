**Biblical theology** "seeks to discover what the biblical writers,
under divine guidance, believed, described, and taught in the
context of their own times." ^[[1]](#note-0)^ It is based first and
foremost on the [Bible](Bible "Bible") itself, and takes the
Scriptures as they are given to us to be the
[inspired](Inspiration_of_the_Bible "Inspiration of the Bible"),
[authoritative](Authority_of_the_Bible "Authority of the Bible")
word of [God](God "God"). Further, biblical theology assumes that
the canon was provided by the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") through the
instrumentality of human authors. From an
[evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical") perspective, biblical
theology also assumes that the original autographs of Scripture
were [inerrant](Inerrancy "Inerrancy").

## Biblical theology and systematic theology

Donald Hagner defines biblical theology as "that discipline which
sets forth the message of the books of the Bible in their
historical setting. Biblical theology is primarily a descriptive
discipline. It is not initially concerned with the final meaning of
the teachings of the Bible or their relevance for today. This is
the task of systematic theology. Biblical theology has the task of
expounding the theology found in the Bible in its own historical
setting, and its own terms, categories, and thought forms. It is
the obvious intent of the Bible to tell a story about God and his
acts in history for humanity’s salvation." ^[[2]](#note-1)^

In
[systematic theology](Systematic_theology "Systematic theology"),
one attempts to summarize biblical [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine"),
addressing theological topics one by one to summarize all the
biblical teaching on each particular subject. However, biblical
theology is not a discipline completely separate from systematic
theology. In fact the approach in biblical theology will overlap
systematic theology at numerous points. It should ultimately end up
with application, which is done through the process of
[practical theology](Practical_theology "Practical theology").

So, rather than tracing certain subjects through the Scriptures and
then summarizing the teaching (as in systematic theology), biblical
theology takes a canonical approach to the matter. While
recognizing the theological unity and coherence of the canon,
biblical theology looks at the theological contributions of the
individual books and authors. It is a study of the nature,
substance, and the content of the theology found in the Bible.

## Old Testament theology

"Though **Old Testament theology** has a close relationship to the
New Testament the two have discrete witnesses of their own.
Therefore [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") theology
must state the Old Testament's unique message before incorporating
the New Testament perspective. The ultimate goal is still to
produce biblical theology yet to unite the testaments at the proper
moment. This procedure is sound on historical, canonical and
exegetical grounds and will make scriptural unity plainer than
starting from the opposite end of the canon. It will also make the
Old Testament's unique value for theology clearer."
^[[3]](#note-2)^

## New Testament theology

[Marshall](I._Howard_Marshall "I. Howard Marshall") writes that the
aim of students of **New Testament theology** is to explore the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") writer's developing
understanding of God and the world, more particularly the world of
people and their relationship to one another.^[[4]](#note-3)^
[N. T. Wright](N._T._Wright "N. T. Wright") also notes that the
"phrase has come to designate, more or less, the attempt to read
the New Testament from a historical point of view, and, either
simultaneously or subsequently, to draw its major theological
emphases together into a coherent statement which can then address
subsequent generations, our own included." ^[[5]](#note-4)^
