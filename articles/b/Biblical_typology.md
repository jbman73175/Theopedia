**Typology** is a method of biblical interpretation whereby an
element found in the Old Testament is seen to prefigure one found
in the New Testament. The initial one is called the *type* and the
fulfillment is designated the *antitype*. Either type or antitype
may be a person, thing, or event, but often the type is messianic
and frequently related to the idea of salvation. The use of
Biblical typology enjoyed greater popularity in previous centuries,
although even now it is by no means ignored as a
[hermeneutic](Hermeneutic "Hermeneutic").

Typological interpretation is specifically the interpretation of
the Old Testament based on the fundamental theological unity of the
two Testaments whereby something in the Old shadows, prefigures,
adumbrates something in the New. Hence, what is interpreted in the
Old is not foreign or peculiar or hidden, but arises naturally out
of the text due to the relationship of the two Testaments.

## Motivation

The study of types, particularly, types of Christ, is motivated by
a number of factors related to New Testament use of the Old
Testament. Firstly, the authors of various New Testament books use
the Old Testament as a source of pictures pointing forward to
Jesus. Among the most obvious passages are
[1 Cor. 10:1–6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2010.1-6&version=31),
[Gal. 4:21–31](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal%204.21-31&version=31)
and the
[letter to the Hebrews](Epistle_to_the_Hebrews "Epistle to the Hebrews").
From 1 Corinthians, we find [Paul](Paul "Paul") using the desert
wanderings as typological of the Christian life, while in
Galatians, he famously uses
[Sarah](index.php?title=Sarah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sarah (page does not exist)")
and
[Hagar](index.php?title=Hagar&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hagar (page does not exist)")
as typological of slavery to Law under the
[Old Covenant](index.php?title=Old_Covenant&action=edit&redlink=1 "Old Covenant (page does not exist)")
against the freedom of grace in the
[New Covenant](New_Covenant "New Covenant"). The author of Hebrews
is concerned to write explaining how the Old Testament points
forward to Jesus; in so doing, he draws on heavily on
[Moses](Moses "Moses") the man, as well as the
[Mosaic Law](index.php?title=Mosaic_Law&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mosaic Law (page does not exist)"),
with its
[sacrifices](index.php?title=Sacrifice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sacrifice (page does not exist)")
and [Temple](Temple "Temple") rituals.

## Classification of types

There are various kinds of types presented in the Old Testament.
Chief among these are the **historical type**, the **legal type**
and the **prophetic type**.
[G.P. Landow](http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/type/typo11.html)

### Historical types

People in the Old Testament frequently are seen to be types of
Christ. For instance, Moses, who led God's people out of slavery in
Egypt and into the rest of the Promised Land, is clearly a type for
[God](God "God")'s Messiah, who leads his people out of slavery to
sin and into the rest of the New Earth. A host of Old Testament
characters can be seen, in this manner, to act as types of Christ,
such as:

-   [Adam](Adam "Adam"), whose sin brought death to all.
    *(see [Jesus as the second Adam](Jesus_as_the_second_Adam "Jesus as the second Adam"))*
-   [David](David "David"), God's anointed yet unrecognised King;
-   [Esther](index.php?title=Esther&action=edit&redlink=1 "Esther (page does not exist)"),
    who saves God's people even when God seems absent
-   [Elisha](index.php?title=Elisha&action=edit&redlink=1 "Elisha (page does not exist)"),
    God's prophet who raised the dead and fed the hungry.

We may also include in this category some of the non-human
'characters' of Biblical history: for example, the rock struck by
Moses in sin yet bringing forth streams of life-giving water
([Numbers 20:1–13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=numbers%2020:1-13;&version=31;)),
or the Temple in Jerusalem.

### Legal types

Within the Law of Moses, many sacrifices, offerings and rituals
were prescribed by God as the worship to be given by Israel. These
sacrifices pointed forward, in different ways, to the one Sacrifice
to be offered on the Cross for the sins of all God's people.

### Prophetic types

Imagery occurs frequently in the prophets and other prophecies
contained in Scripture. For instance, the promise of Genesis 3:15
is cast in terms of the struggle between men and serpents, and yet
it contains the Gospel, as the Seed of the woman crushes the head
of the Serpent once and for all on the Cross; it is for this reason
that this verse is called the Protevangelium.

## Survey of perspectives

The historical development of perspectives regarding typology is
important for understanding the issues. For example, following the
Reformation period, several distinct schools of thought developed.
Among conservative scholars there were three major positions:
[Johannes Cocceius](Johannes_Cocceius "Johannes Cocceius")
(1603-1669) applied any OT event or person that resembled a NT
parallel, thereby coming close to an allegorical approach. John
March (1757-1839) asserted that the only types were those
explicitly stated to be types in the NT. Later,
[Patrick Fairbairn](Patrick_Fairbairn "Patrick Fairbairn")
(1805-1874) mediated between the two by accepting both explicit and
inferred types, stating that many more correspondences existed in
the NT period than happen to be enumerated in the texts
themselves.^[[2]](#note-1)^

With the rise of the
[historical-critical](Biblical_criticism "Biblical criticism")
method in the 19th century, non-conservative scholarship repudiated
the unity between the Testaments and regarded typology as an
inferior method, since Scripture (by their view) contained the
disparate religious experiences of diverse groups rather than a
unified historical record.^[[3]](#note-2)^

Most modern liberal scholars continue to disregard typology
altogether. Lampe argues that, historically speaking, typology was
traditionally understood as the real meaning of the Old Testament -
a meaning read into it by the Holy Spirit, even though no one in
the OT could have understood it. He concludes that not only is this
old fashioned and out-dated, but typology is no longer to be
pursued.^[[4]](#note-3)^

Gerhard von Rad, who writes from a rather
[Neo-orthodox](Neo-orthodox "Neo-orthodox") perspective,
understands typology as just more or less analogical
thinking.^[[5]](#note-4)^

Within evangelicalism, the traditional view is that types occurred
because God intentionally constructed pictures of Christ, and then
placed those pictures within Israel's history.

## Issues in the use of Typology

Typology represents a vital part of early Christian hermeneutics
built upon the belief that God is in control and has unified His
Word and the events in redemptive history.^[[6]](#note-5)^ It is
questioned whether typology is prospective (the OT type as a
divinely ordained prediction) or retrospective (the NT antitype as
analogously related but not prefigured in the type). It is likely
that the solution lies in the middle. The OT authors and
participants did not necessarily recognize any typological force in
the original, but in the divine plan the early event did anticipate
the later reality. Thus David's coronation (e.g., Psa. 2, 72, 110)
did indeed foreshadow Jesus' enthronement as the royal Messiah,
though it was not a direct prediction.

The term that best describes this balance is "promise-fulfillment"
as suggested by Moo.^[[7]](#note-6)^ The OT type is promissory and
the NT antitype fulfills the divine purpose implicit in the earlier
event. Yet there is no need to assert that God had a meaning in the
OT type of which the human author was not aware or that the OT
texts had a “fuller sense” or deeper meaning than was realized by
the original authors in order to explain either prophetic
fulfillment or typology.^[[8]](#note-7)^

A canonical approach to the problem states that any particular
biblical text can be interpreted in terms of its total biblical
context. In other words, all of Scripture is analogously related,
NT writers could see many parallels between Jesus and the religious
experiences of Israel (e.g., David's brush with death in Psa.
16:8-11; cf. Acts 2:25-31) without necessitating any “deeper”
thrust in the earlier passage.^[[9]](#note-8)^
