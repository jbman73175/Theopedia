"You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have
eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me," (John
5:39)
**Bibliolatry** is the idolatry of the text of the Bible or the
book or scroll itself upon which the text is printed. It is the
worship of the book rather than the worship of its Divine Author.
