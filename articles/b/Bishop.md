A **bishop** is an English translation of the Koine Greek word
*episkopos* found in various places in the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"). The word can also
be translated "guardian" or "overseer".

In Christianity, a *bishop* is an ordained clergy person who is
given authority over the Church and responsibility and guardianship
over the Christian Faith. *Bishops* also serve as administrative
leaders in denominations with
*[episcopal](Episcopal_(polity) "Episcopal (polity)")* forms of
church polity.

## Scripture

-   Acts 20:28 - refers to the episcopal role equated in some way
    with that of the [Elder](Elder "Elder") (*presbuteros*)

"Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which
the Holy Spirit has made you *overseers* [*episkopoi*...in this
verse, the traditional translation of *episkopos* has been
*overseers*], to care for the church of God, which he obtained with
his own blood."
-   Philippians 1:1 - simply mentions the existence of bishops

"Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in
Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the *bishops* and
deacons..."
-   1 Timothy 3:1-7 - some qualifications for the episcopacy

"This saying is true: whoever aspires to the office of *bishop*
desires a noble task. Now a *bishop* must be above reproach,
married only once, temperate, sensible, respectable, hospitable, an
apt teacher, not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not
quarrelsome, and not a lover of money. He must manage his own
household well, keeping his children submissive and respectful in
every way - for if someone does not know how to manage his own
household, how can he take care of God's church? He must not be a
recent convert, or he may be puffed up with conceit and fall into
the condemnation of the devil. Moreover, he must be well thought of
by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace and the snare
of the devil."
-   Titus 1:7-9 - some qualifications for the episcopacy

"...a *bishop*, as God's steward, must be blameless, not arrogant
or quick-tempered or addicted to wine or violent or greedy for
gain, but hospitable, a lover of goodness, prudent, upright,
devout, and self-controlled. He must have a firm grasp of the word
that is trustworthy in accordance with the teaching, so that he may
be able both to preach with sound doctrine and to refute those who
contradict it."
-   1 Peter 2:25 - reference to Christ as the Bishop
    *par excellence*

"For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the
Shepherd and *Bishop* of your souls."
## Early Church & Eastern Orthodoxy

"Scholars are virtually unanimous that in the early church the
*presbuteros* and the *episkopos* were one and the same. Indeed,
there is no clear evidence for a monarchical episcopate being
firmly established until the early decades of the second century."
- Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology ("Overseer"
entry)

By 200 AD, bishops were ordained clergy charged with overseeing
large cities or regions, presiding over the churches of their
assigned area. At some point, the offices of *episkopos* (bishop)
and *presbuteros* (elder) were separated, with elders serving a
more localized pastoral function and bishops overseeing their
work.

## Non-Episcopal traditions

In Presbyterian churches, episcopal authority is generally viewed
to be vested in the local presbytery. Some traditions place this
authority in a governing board of stewards, while others view the
episcopal role as identical with that of the *presbyter* or
presiding [elder](Elder "Elder").
