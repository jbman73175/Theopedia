**Blaise Pascal** (June 19, 1623–August 19, 1662) was a French
mathematician, physicist, and religious philosopher. Pascal was a
child prodigy, who was educated by his father. Pascal's earliest
work was in the natural and applied sciences, where he made
important contributions to the construction of mechanical
calculators and the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of
pressure and vacuum by expanding the work of Evangelista
Torricelli. Pascal also wrote powerfully in defence of the
scientific method.

He was a mathematician of the first order. In mathematics, Pascal
helped create two major new areas of research. He wrote a
significant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at the
age of sixteen and corresponded with Pierre de Fermat from 1654 on
probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern
economics and social science.

Following a mystical experience in late 1654, he left mathematics
and physics and devoted himself to reflection and writing about
philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this
period: the Lettres provinciales and the Pensées. However, he had
suffered from ill-health throughout his life and his new interests
were ended by his early death two months after his 39th birthday.

## The Pensees

Unfortunately, Pascal couldn't finish his most influential
theological work, the Pensées, before his death. It was to have
been a sustained and coherent examination of and defense of the
Christian faith, with the original title Apologie de la religion
Chrétienne ("Apology of the Christian Religion"). What was found
upon sifting through his personal items after his death were
numerous scraps of paper with isolated thoughts, grouped in a
tentative, but telling, order. The first version of the detached
notes appeared in print as a book in 1670 titled Pensées de M.
Pascal sur la réligion, et sur quelques autres sujets ("Thoughts of
M. Pascal on religion, and on other subjects") and soon thereafter
became a classic. Because his friends and the scholars at
Port-Royal were concerned that these fragmentary "thoughts" might
lead to skepticism rather than to piety, they concealed the
skeptical pieces and modified some of the rest, lest King or Church
should take offense for at that time the persecution of Port-Royal
had ceased, and the editors were not interested in a renewal of
controversy. Not until the nineteenth century were the Pensées
published in their full and authentic text.

Pascal's Pensées sits among the most profound and beautifully
written masterpieces in the history of the world. When commenting
on one particular section, Sainte-Beuve praised it as the finest
pages in the French language. Will Durant, in his 11-volume,
comprehensive The Story of Civilization series, hailed it as "the
most eloquent book in French prose." In Pensées, Pascal surveys
several philosophical paradoxes: infinity and nothing, faith and
reason, soul and matter, death and life, meaning and
vanity—seemingly arriving at no definitive conclusions besides
humility, ignorance, and grace. Rolling these into one he develops
Pascal's Wager.

## Pascal's Wager

Pascal's Wager (also known as Pascal's Gambit) is Blaise Pascal's
application of decision theory to the belief in God. It is one of
three 'wagers' which appear in his Pensées, a collection of notes
for an unfinished treatise on Christian apologetics. Pascal argues
that it is always a better "bet" to believe in God, because the
expected value to be gained from believing in God is always greater
than the expected value resulting from non-belief. Note that this
is not an argument for the existence of God, but rather one for the
belief in God. Pascal specifically aimed the argument at such
persons who were not convinced by traditional arguments for the
existence of God. With his wager he sought to demonstrate that
believing in God is advantageous to not believing, and hoped that
this would convert those who rejected previous theological
arguments.

### Explanation

It states that if you were to analyse your options in regard to
belief in Pascal's God carefully (or belief in any other religious
system with a similar reward and punishment scheme), you would come
out with the following possibilities:

-   You may believe in God, and God exists, in which case you go to
    heaven: your gain is infinite.
-   You may believe in God, and God doesn't exist, in which case
    your loss is finite and therefore negligible.
-   You may not believe in God, and God doesn't exist, in which
    case your gain is finite and therefore negligible.
-   You may not believe in God, and God exists, in which case you
    will go to hell: your loss is infinite.

From these possibilities, and the principles of
[statistics](index.php?title=Statistics&action=edit&redlink=1 "Statistics (page does not exist)"),
Pascal deduced that it would be better to believe in God
unconditionally. It is a classic application of "game theory" to
itemize options and payoffs and is valid within its assumptions.

## Mystical Experience

When Pascal was 31 years old he had a mystical experience which
apparently he never mentioned to anyone. He did however write down
a brief and very moving summary of it, apparently (from the title)
so that he would never forget it. He sewed this into the lining of
his coat, and after his early death from stomach cancer his servant
found the parchment. This translation is by Emile Caillet and John
C. Blankenagel, Great Shorter Works of Pascal, Philadelphia,
Westminster Press, 1948.
