According to
[Matthew 12:32](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2012:32&version=49),
"whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven
him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be
forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come."
([NASB](NASB "NASB"))

"[B]lasphemy of the Holy Spirit is saying that Jesus did His
miracles by the power of the devil."^[[1]](#note-carm)^
Others theologians believe that blasphemy of the Holy Spirit refers
to final unrepentance. Some of these see a parallel in
[Hebrews 6:4-6](Hebrews_6#4 "Hebrews 6") and
[1 John 5:16](1_John_5#6 "1 John 5");
*See [Matthew 12:22-32](Matthew_12 "Matthew 12")*

## Why is it unforgivable?

"This is unforgivable because it struck at the very heart of the
redemptive work of God in Christ. It struck at the very nature of
Jesus’ ministry of redemption, testimony, and teaching. Jesus was
ministering in the power of the Holy Spirit Himself, fulfilling the
divine plan of God to provide a sacrifice for our sins (John 3:16;
1 John 4:10). The Pharisees were attributing this to demonic
activity."^[[1]](#note-carm)^
## Can believers commit it?

"No. A believer cannot commit the unforgivable sin. How can someone
who has been born again (John 3:7), made a new creation (2 Cor.
5:17), and received eternal life (John 10:27-28) actually commit
the unforgivable sin? He cannot. Jesus Himself said that we have
eternal life, not conditional life: "My sheep hear My voice, and I
know them, and they follow Me; and I give eternal life to them, and
they shall never perish; and no one shall snatch them out of My
hand." Besides, it says in 2 Cor. 5:17 that the Christian is a new
creation in Christ. We are different, no longer slaves to the old
nature (Rom. 6:14). We are regenerated by the Holy
Spirit."^[[1]](#note-carm)^
