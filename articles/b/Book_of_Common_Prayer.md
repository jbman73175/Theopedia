The **Book of Common Prayer** is the prayer book of the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England") and also
the name for similar books used in other churches in the
[Anglican](Anglicanism "Anglicanism") Communion. It has been
through many revisions over the last few centuries. It contains the
order to be followed in church services. Within the United Kingdom,
it can only be printed by one of the privileged presses, as it is
under perpetual Crown Copyright.

## History of the Prayer Book

### Early Prayer Books

The earliest English-language service book of the Church of England
was the Exhortation and Litany. Published in 1544, it borrowed
greatly from [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther")'s
Litany and Myles Coverdale's New Testament, and was the only
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") service to be finished within
the lifetime of King Henry VIII.

In 1548, [Thomas Cranmer](Thomas_Cranmer "Thomas Cranmer") finished
work on an English Communion, obeying an order of Parliament that
Communion was to be given as both bread and wine. This was the
first service to reveal Protestantism that was beginning to
influence the English Church. The service existed as an addition to
the pre-existing Latin Mass, and much of Cranmer's language in this
service has survived through the many subsequent revisions to the
present day.

One year later, in 1549, a full prayer book had been finished and
was published under the leadership of Cranmer during the reign of
Edward VI. The Preface to this edition, which contained Cranmer's
explanation as to why a new prayer book was necessary, began:
"There was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so
sure established, which in continuance of time hath not been
corrupted". The original version was used until only 1552, when a
further revision was released.

In 1553, upon the succession of Mary I to the throne, an attempt
was made at a counter-reformation in England. Cranmer was punished
for his work in the Protestant reformation by being burned at the
stake on March 21, 1556. All further development would continue
without his instruction.

### The 1559 Prayer Book

Under Elizabeth I of England, a restoration of the Anglican Church
was undertaken, and a new prayer book was published in 1559. This
book was used for over 100 years, thus being the official prayer
book under the Stuarts as well as being the first Anglican service
in America. Without Cranmer's direction in the 1559 revision, a
number of elements leaned toward more Catholic teachings, if not
merely for his absence, perhaps as the effect of years of
uncertainty within the church. Amongst these included:

-   Saints' holidays were added to the liturgical calendar;
-   Prayers against the Pope were dropped from the litany; and
-   The suggested use of more traditional vestments by ministers.

This use of this revision was outlawed in 1645 by the Long
Parliament as part of the increasingly Puritan ideals then
developing in the nation, and, given the religious leanings of Lord
Protector Cromwell, it would not be replaced until shortly after
the return of the monarchy to England.

### The 1662 Prayer Book

The 1662 prayer book was printed but two years after the
restoration of the monarchy, and, given the mildly Catholic
leanings of the monarchy at the time, the 1662 was a surprisingly
Protestant revision. A number of ecclesiastical scholars in England
saw merit in the beliefs of the Puritans and worked some of these
into the prayer book. This revision survives today as the approved
Book of Common Prayer in England, with only minor revisions since
its publication (mostly due the changes in the monarchy and in the
dominion of the Empire).

The language of the 1662 revision was much unchanged from that of
Cranmer, with the exception of the modernization of only the most
archaic words and phrases. This book was the one which had existed
as the official Book of Common Prayer during the most monumental
periods of growth of the British empire, and, as a result, has been
a great influence on the prayer books of Anglican churches
worldwide, [liturgies](Liturgy "Liturgy") of other denominations in
English, and of the English language as a whole.

### Further Developments of the English Book of Common Prayer

After the 1662 prayer book, development did not cease in England. A
subsequent, far more Protestant revision was developed later in the
17th Century, but was scrapped as the various parties influencing
the work pressed for tolerance of their respective denominations
within England as opposed to inclusion in the liturgy. This work,
however, did go on to influence the prayer books of many British
colonies.

England, then, continued on using the 1662 version. It looked as
though this would change in the early days of the 20th century when
work was started on a revision slated to be finished in the 1920s.

In 1927, this proposed prayer book was finished. It was decided,
during development, that the use of the services therein would be
decided on by each given congregation, so as to avoid as much
conflict as possible with traditionalists. With these open
guidelines the book was granted approval by the Church of England
Convocations and Church Assembly. Since the Church of England is a
state church, a further step—sending the proposed revision to
Parliament—was required, and the book was rejected in December of
that year when the MP William Joynson-Hicks argued strongly against
it on the grounds that the proposed book was "papistical" and
insufficiently Protestant. The next year was spent revising the
book to make it more suitable for Parliament, but it was rejected
yet again in 1928. However Convocation declared a state of
emergency and authorised bishops to use the revised Book throughout
that emergency.

The Church of England has not since produced any revisions to the
Prayer Book, other than those required for the changes to the
monarchy, though a number of books that are not the Book of Common
Prayer per se have been developed for the order of services, namely
the 1980 *Alternative Service Book* and the 2000 *Common Worship*
series of books.

In 2003, a [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic")
adaptation of the BCP was published called the
*Book of Divine Worship*. It is a compromise of material drawn from
the proposed 1928 book, the 1979 ECUSA book, and the Roman Missal.
It was published primarily for use by Catholic converts from
Anglicanism within the Anglican Use.

### Brief Overview of Several Prayer Books

A number of other nations have developed Anglican churches and
their own revisions of the Book of Common Prayer. Several are
listed here:

The
**[Episcopal Church in the United States of America](Episcopalian "Episcopalian")**
has produced numerous prayer books since the inception of the
church in 1789. Work on the first book began in 1786 and was
subsequently finished and published in 1789. The preface thereto
mentions that "this Church is far from intending to depart from the
Church of England in any essential point of doctrine, discipline,
or worship...further than local circumstances require." Further
revisions to the prayer book in the United States occurred in 1892,
1928, and 1979. Each edition was released into the public domain on
publication, which has contributed to its influence as other
churches have freely borrowed from it.

The
**[Anglican Church of Canada](Anglican_Church_of_Canada "Anglican Church of Canada")**
developed its first Book of Common Prayer separate from the English
version in 1918. A revision thereto was published in 1962. Some
supplements have been developed over the past several years to the
prayer book, and the *Book of Alternative Services*, published in
1985, is commonly used in many parishes.

The
**[Scottish Episcopal Church](index.php?title=Scottish_Episcopal_Church&action=edit&redlink=1 "Scottish Episcopal Church (page does not exist)")**
has had a number of revisions to the Book of Common Prayer since it
was first adapted for Scottish use in 1637. These revisions were
developed simultaneously with the English book till the mid-17th
century when the Scottish book departed from the English revisions.
A completely new revision was finished in 1929, and several
revisions to the communion service seem to have been prepared since
then.

## Influence

The Book of Common Prayer has had a great influence on a number of
other denominations. While theologically different, the language
and flow of the service of many other churches owes a great debt to
the prayer book.

[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley"), an Anglican priest whose
teachings are ascribed as the foundations of
[Methodism](Methodism "Methodism") said, "I believe there is no
Liturgy in the world, either in ancient or modern language, which
breathes more of a solid, scriptural, rational piety than the
Common Prayer of the Church of England." Presently, most Methodist
services have a very similar service and theology to that of the
Anglican church. The *United Methodist Book of Worship* (1992,
[ISBN 0687035724](http://www.theopedia.com/Special:BookSources/0687035724)
) uses the *Book of Common Prayer* as its primary model.

In the 1960s, when
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism") adopted
a vernacular mass, many translations of the English prayers
followed the form of Cranmer's translation. Indeed, a number of
theologians have suggested that the later
*English Alternative Service Book* and 1979
*American Book of Common Prayer* borrowed from the Roman Catholic
vernacular liturgy.
