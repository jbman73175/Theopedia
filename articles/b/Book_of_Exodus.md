[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament")
The **book of Exodus** ([Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew"):
**Vellay Shemot** or just **Shemot**, meaning
*"These are the names..."*) is the second book of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament"). It deals with
Israel's departure (from the Greek *exodos*, from which we get the
name of the book) from Egypt and draws out in detail God's
relationship with this nation. It can be broken up by geographical
arrangement:

-   Israel in Egypt (Ex. 1:1 - 12:36)
-   Israel in the desert (Ex. 12:37 - 18:27)
-   Israel at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19 - 40)

    (QuickTime), by Douglas Stuart

Exodus begins with Israel's captivity in the land of Egypt
(1:9-14). Recapping from the last chapters of Genesis,
[Jacob](Jacob "Jacob") has just moved his decendants to this land,
and they have settled in Egypt and begin to multiply. Their growing
number concerns the Egyptians, and in an attempt to impose control
over the Israelites, they make the Israelites slaves under the
bondage of Pharaoh. The Israelites bondage is so great that they
cry out to [God](God "God"), and he answers them by raising up a
prophet, [Moses](Moses "Moses"). Throughout Exodus, God
[reveals Himself](Revelation_of_God "Revelation of God") more fully
through Moses (cf. Ex. 3:14) to Israel.

Moses tells Pharaoh to let the Israelites go, and after ten plagues
they are finally released (Ex. 11:1; 12:31). After the
[Passover](index.php?title=Passover&action=edit&redlink=1 "Passover (page does not exist)"),
the Israelites leave Egypt and cross the Red Sea on their journey
to Mount Sinai. Here, God reveals his law through the
[Ten Commandments](Ten_Commandments "Ten Commandments") and his
plans to build the tabernacle.

## Exodus and the New Testament

In relation to the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"),
it is interesting to note Moses' words in Exodus 24:8, "This is the
blood of the covenant." Upon a reading of Matthew 26:28, a
connection can be made with the words of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")
when he says, "this is my blood of the covenant." Furthermore,
there is an interesting, yet speculative connection between Luke's
choice of the [Greek](Greek "Greek") *exodos*, meaning "exodus" or
"departure". Here, at the
[Transfiguration](Transfiguration "Transfiguration"),
[Peter](Peter "Peter"), [James](James "James"), and
[John](John "John") speak of Jesus' "departure". Theologians have
made note of this, understanding the
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") that Jesus brings to those who
are exiled. Jesus' departure, or exodus to the cross will bring
such salvation just as [God](God "God") saved Israel through Moses
in their Exodus (Arnold & Beyer, p. 111).
