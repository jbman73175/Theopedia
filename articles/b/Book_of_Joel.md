## Contents

1.  A prophecy of a great public calamity then impending over the
    land, consisting of a want of water and an extraordinary plague of
    locusts (1:1-2:11).
2.  The prophet then calls on his countrymen to repent and to turn
    to God, assuring them of his readiness to forgive (2:12-17), and
    foretelling the restoration of the land to its accustomed
    fruitfulness (18-26).
3.  Then follows a Messianic prophecy, quoted by
    [Peter](Peter "Peter")
    ([Acts](Acts_of_the_Apostles "Acts of the Apostles") 2:39).
4.  Finally, the prophet foretells portents and judgments as
    destined to fall on the enemies of God (ch. 3, but in the Hebrew
    text 4).
