## Content

The **Book of Jonah** gives an account of the prophet
[Jonah](index.php?title=Jonah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jonah (page does not exist)")
and the well-known story in which [God](God "God") tells him to
prophesy to the people of
[Nineveh](index.php?title=Nineveh&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nineveh (page does not exist)")
to persuade them to repent or face destruction. Jonah attempts to
run the other direction, is thrown from a ship in a storm,
swallowed by a giant fish, and transported to Nineveh. He decides
to take the hint and preaches to the city. The population is so
moved by the warning that there is a general call to
[fasting](Fasting "Fasting") and
[repentance](Repentance "Repentance") which satisfies God enough to
spare the city from destruction. Jonah is angered by
[God's mercy](Mercy_of_God "Mercy of God") until God rebukes him
about the need for him to show mercy.

## The Fish

Interpretations of the "fish" fall into three general categories:

1.  A big fish or whale (of unspecified species) did indeed swallow
    Jonah.
2.  A special creation (not any fish we know of) of God
    accomplished the act.
3.  There was not an actual fish: the story is an allegory, the
    fish is a literary device in the story, the story is a vision or a
    dream. etc.
