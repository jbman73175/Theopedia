The **Book of Nature** is an expression indicating a world view
that sees all of created order as one particular means in which God
communicates with man in a way that parallels the purpose of holy
scripture (i.e., the Book of Scripture). In other words, God is the
author of two books: the [Bible](Bible "Bible") and that of
nature.

The first person to use this expression was
[Augustine](Augustine "Augustine"). It occurred when he was
asserting that even fallen creation is essentially good over
against the Manichaeans' claim of the material world being
intrinsically evil.^[[1]](#note-0)^

As a topic the *Book of Nature* regularly appears in the
scholarship of
[science and theology](Science_and_theology "Science and theology").
It is important to work seeking to understand the patristic and
medieval use of biblical allegory as well as the thesis that the
denial of medieval allegory by Protestants such as
[Luther](Luther "Luther") and [Calvin](Calvin "Calvin") led to
early modern thought. Here the physical interpretation of the book
of nature--man's experience in the realms of physical and
biological reality--goes hand in hand with the
[hermeneutical](Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics") understanding of the
Book of Scripture.
