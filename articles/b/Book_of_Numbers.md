[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament")
**Numbers** is more than a book about "numbers" or numerical
issues. It contains the story of Israel's journey from Mount Sinai
to the plains of Moab on the border of Canaan. The translators of
the [Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint") gave it the name
"Numbers" because of the books census lists found in chs. 1 and 26.
The [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew") name, *bemidbar*, means more properly
"in the desert".

    (QuickTime), by Douglas Stuart

The beginning of Numbers (1:1 - 10:10) deals with Israel's
preparation to leave Mount Sinai. Yet, they refused to enter the
promised land (10:11 - 20:21), with the climax of the book
appearing in chapter 14. Israel did not trust God, for when he said
that he would give the nation the land of Canaan (13:1) they still
would not trust Him and feared men over the Lord (13:31-33). Israel
complained, saying "wouldn't it be better for us to go back to
Egypt?" (14:3). [Moses](Moses "Moses") and [Aaron](Aaron "Aaron")
attempted to tell the nation, "...do not rebel against the LORD.
And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will
swallow them up. Their protection is gone, but the LORD is with us.
Do not be afraid of them," (14:9). Sadly, not only did Israel not
listen, but they even "talked about stoning them" (14:10).

Israel rebelled despite their recent redemption from the Egyptians,
found in [Exodus](Exodus "Exodus"). Furthermore, [God](God "God")
had recently made a [covenant](Covenant "Covenant") with them at
Mount Sinai, however, Israel still disobeyed and did not trust God.
God's decision was "for forty years - one year for each of the
forty days you explored this land - you will suffer for your sins
and know what it is like to have me against you," (14:34). Moses
was not spared from this disobedience (cf. Num. 20:1-13) and was
not allowed to enter the promised land. The rest of Numbers (20:22
- 36:13) may be seen as more preparation to enter the land of
Canaan.

## Relationship to the New Testament

Interesting to note is
[1 Corinthian's](1_Corinthians "1 Corinthians") use of Numbers.
[Paul](Paul "Paul") says in two places that Israel's disobedience
was to serve as an example of "warnings" or what *not* to do (10:6,
11). He then relates these issues to dealing with temptation,
noting that "God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond
what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a
way out so that you can stand up under it," (10:13).

Furthermore, Hebrews 3:7 - 4:11 also deals with Israel's
disobedience. More specifically it quotes Psalms 95:7-11, although
this passage also deals with the events in the book of Numbers. The
author of Hebrews warns its readers of unbelief, using Israel as an
example. He encourages them to "take care" lest they have "an evil,
unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God" like the
Israelites of old (Heb. 3:12). In the end, after using Israel as an
example, the writer of Hebrews exhorts his readers: "Let us
therefore make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may
fall through such disobedience as theirs," (Heb. 4:11).
