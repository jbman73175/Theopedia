    (MP3), by [Mark Dever](Mark_Dever "Mark Dever")

Mistakenly called "Revelations" (plural), this book of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") is correctly known as **Revelation**. It has
also been called the **Book of the Apocalypse**.

## Author and Date

The book of Revelation was written by the
[apostle](Apostle "Apostle") [John](John "John") on the island of
Patmos. A common dating of the book is toward the end of Domitian's
reign, at about the year 95 A.D. This is based largely on the
following comment by [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") (emphasis
added):

"We will not, however, incur the risk of pronouncing positively as
to the name of Antichrist; for if it were necessary that his name
should be distinctly revealed in this present time, it would have
been announced by him who beheld the apocalyptic vision. For that
was seen no very long time since, but almost in our day,
***towards the end of Domitianâ€™s reign***". ^[[1]](#note-0)^
Others propose a date prior to the fall of Jerusalem in 70 A.D.
Such a dating is favoured by
[postmillennialists](Postmillennialism "Postmillennialism"), who
see the destruction of Jerusalem as the fullfilment of much of the
prophecy within Revelation. Those with this view propose that
Irenaeus was either:

1.  Wrong; or
2.  Referring to *John* by the pronoun "that", rather than
    *the apocalyptic vision*. That is to say, *John* was seen toward
    the end of Domitians reign, though he had had *the vision* many
    years earlier.

## Genre

Revelation is written in 'apocalyptic' form, a type of Jewish
literature that uses symbolic imagery to communicate hope (in the
ultimate triumph of God) to those in the midst of persecution. The
events are ordered according to literary, rather than strictly
chronological, patterns

## Blueprint

Revelation is generally divided into two distinct parts:

-   The letters to the churches (1:1 - 3:22)

The vision John received opens with instructions for him to write
to seven churches. He both commends them for their strengths and
warns them about their flaws. Each letter was directed to a church
then in existence, but also speaks to conditions in the church
throughout history. Both in the church and in our individual lives,
we must constantly fight against the temptation to become loveless,
immoral, lenient, compromising, lifeless, or casual about our
faith. The letters make it clear how our Lord feels about these
qualities.

-   Message for the church (4:1 - 22:21)

This revelation is both a warning to Christians who have grown
apathetic and an encouragement to those who are faithuflly enduring
the struggles in this world. It reassures us that good will triumph
over evil, gives us hope as we face difficult times, and gives
guidance when we are wavering in our faith. Christ's message to the
church is a message of hope for all believers in every generation.

## Themes

Major themes contained in Revelation include:

-   **God's sovereignty** - God is sovereign. He is greater than
    any power in the universe. God is not to be compared with any
    leader, government, or religion. He controls history for the
    purpose of uniting true believers in loving fellowship with him.
    Though [Satan's](Satan "Satan") power may temporarily increase, we
    are not to be led astray. God is all-powerful. He is in control. He
    will bring his true family safely into eternal life. Because he
    cares for us, we can trust him with our very lives.

-   **Christ's return** - Christ came to earth as a "Lamb," the
    symbol of his perfect sacrifice for our sin. He will return as the
    triumphant "Lion," the rightful ruler and conqueror. He will defeat
    Satan, settle accounts with all those who reject him, and bring his
    faithful people into eternity. Assurance of Christ's return gives
    suffering Christians the strength to endure. We can look forward to
    his return as King and Judge. Since no one knows the time when he
    will appear, we must be ready at all times by keeping our faith
    strong.

-   **God's faithful people** - John wrote to encourage the church
    to resist the demands to worship the Roman emperor. He warns all
    God's faithful people to be devoted only to Christ. Revelation
    identifies who the faithful people are and what they should be
    doing until Christ returns. You can take your place in the ranks of
    God's faithful people by believing in Christ. Victory is sure for
    those who resist temptation and make loyalty to Christ their top
    priority.

-   **Judgment** - One day God's anger toward [sin](Sin "Sin") will
    be fully and completely unleashed. Satan will be defeated with all
    of his agents. False religion will be destroyed. God will reward
    the faithful with [eternal life](Heaven "Heaven"), but all who
    refuse to believe in him will face
    [eternal punishment](Hell "Hell"). Evil and injustice will not
    prevail forever. God's final [judgment](Judgment "Judgment") will
    put an end to these. We need to be certain of our commitment to
    Jesus if we want to escape this great final judgment. No one who
    rejects Christ will escape God's punishment.

-   **Hope** - One day God will create a new
    [heaven](Heaven "Heaven") and a new earth. All believers will live
    with him forever in perfect peace and security. Those who have
    already died will be raised to life. These promises for the future
    bring hope. Our great hope is that what Christ promises will come
    true. When we have confidence in our final destination, we can
    follow Christ with unwavering dedication no matter what we must
    face. We can be encouraged by hoping in Christ's return.
