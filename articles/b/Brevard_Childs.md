**Brevard S. Childs** (1923-2007),
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") professor at
[Yale University](Yale_University "Yale University") from 1958
until he retired in 1999. Childs had a significant positive
influence in
[biblical theology](Biblical_theology "Biblical theology") by
insisting that interpreters should be Christians who view the text
as [Scripture](Scripture "Scripture") and regard the final form of
the [canon](Canon "Canon") as the norm for
[interpretation](Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics"). However, he held to
many [liberal](Liberalism "Liberalism") views about Scripture,
denying that [Moses](Moses "Moses") wrote the
[Pentateuch](Pentateuch "Pentateuch") and seeing elements of pagan
mythology in the Bible.

After serving in U.S. Army during WWII and studying at the
University of Michigan, Childs earned his B.D. at Princeton
Theological Seminary (1950) and then a doctorate at the University
of Basel, Switzerland (1955).
