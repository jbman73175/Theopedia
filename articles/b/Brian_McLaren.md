Brian McLaren
**Brian McLaren** (b. 1956) is a pastor, author, and speaker. He
has been the pastor of Cedar Ridge Community Church since 1986, a
church he helped form in 1982. McLaren has a BA and MA from
University of Maryland, and was awarded an honorary Doctor of
Divinity Degree from Carey Theological Seminary in Vancouver, BC,
Canada.

McLaren is a noted spokesperson for the
[Emerging church](Emerging_church "Emerging church"), having
written several provacative books in this area. In his 2004 book,
*A Generous Orthodoxy* (Zondervan), he offers what amounts to a
manifesto for the Emergent movement.^[[1]](#note-0)^

Critics say that McLaren's theological journey has now led him
outside Christian orthodoxy altogether. Tim Challies notes that in
McLaren's latest book, *A New Kind of Christianity*, "he denies the
Fall, he denies original sin, he denies human depravity, he denies
hell. And that is just in the first few pages. Needless to say, all
of this leads him to a radically unbiblical view of the cross and
the purpose and work of Jesus."^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Quotes

-   "I can imagine some impassioned critic of this book concluding
    a review with a statement something like this: 'It's bad enough
    that McLaren has undermined conventional understandings of hell,
    but in its place what has he offered? No clear alternative. One
    cannot even tell for sure, after a careful reading of this book,
    whether McLaren is an inclusivist, conditionalist, or universalist.
    All one can say is that he is clearly not an orthodox exclusivist.'
    In response, I might offer, as I have often suggested elsewhere,
    that clarity is good, but sometimes intrigue may be even more
    precious; clarity tends to put an end to further thinking, whereas
    intrigue makes one think more intensely, broadly, and deeply.
    Jesus' teaching on the kingdom of God is a case in point; his
    parables don't score too well on clarity, but they excel in
    intrigue." -Introduction to *The Last Word and The Word After That*
    [[1]](http://www.opensourcetheology.net/node/626)
-   "I don't believe making disciples must equal making adherents
    to the Christian religion. It may be advisable in many (not all!)
    circumstances to help people become followers of Jesus and remain
    within their Buddhist, Hindu, or Jewish contexts." —A Generous
    Orthodoxy
