Bruce Metzger pictured on the cover of his autobiography
**Bruce M. Metzger** (1914 - 2007), born in Middletown
Pennsylvania, is Collard Professor Emeritus of New Testament
Language and Literature at Princeton Theological Seminary where he
served for forty-six years before retiring in 1984. A recognized
authority on the text of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), Metzger has served
on the board of the American Bible Society and became the driving
force of the United Bible Societies' series of Greek Texts (1966,
1968, 1975, 1993). He was chairperson of the
[NRSV](New_Revised_Standard_Version "New Revised Standard Version")
Bible Committee, which produced the New Revised Standard Version
(1989).

"Along with his translation efforts, Metzger wrote a companion work
to the United Bible Societies Greek New Testaments,
*A Textual Commentary of The Greek New Testament* (1975) wherein he
explains and reasons, verse by verse, for the textual decisions of
the Committee that totals over 2,000 variant readings. This went
one step beyond Erwin Nestle's evidentiary efforts by actually
explaining the Committees thinking during the process of selecting
readings, thus allowing students to understand the why behind the
UBS Greek Text."
