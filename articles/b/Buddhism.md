**Buddhism** is an offshoot of the pantheistic religion of
[Hinduism](Hinduism "Hinduism"), originating around 525 BC in
India. Buddhists focus on the philosophical and psychological
teachings of Gautama Buddha and imitate his way of life. There are
two major sects, Theravada, prevalent in south east Asia, and
Mahayana, prevalent in China, Tibet, Korea and
[Japan](index.php?title=Japan&action=edit&redlink=1 "Japan (page does not exist)").
Theravada adherants attempt to train and purify the mind by
following the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path,
hoping to understand the true nature of all things, eliminate
stress and suffering from their experience, and achieve Nirvana
(liberation). Mahayana is further subdivided into many sects,
including Nichiren and Zen Buddhism.

  
The Four Noble Truths

\1. We all suffer (Dukkha)- This involves experiences of pain,
 sorrow, misery, and lack of fulfillment.

\2. Everything is impermanent (Anicca)- We suffer because we desire
 things that are impermanent.

\3. The way to liberate ourselves is to eliminate desire.

\4. Desire can be eliminated by following the Eightfold Path.
