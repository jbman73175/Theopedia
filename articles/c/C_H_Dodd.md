C. H. Dodd
**Charles Harold Dodd** (April 7, 1884 - September 25, 1973) was a
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") scholar. He was
known for promoting
[realized eschatology](index.php?title=Realized_eschatology&action=edit&redlink=1 "Realized eschatology (page does not exist)"),
the belief that [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")' references to the
[kingdom of God](Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God") meant a present
rather than future reality. "In 1930 he became Rylands Professor of
Biblical Criticism and Exegesis in Manchester where he remained
until 1935. He was elected to the Norris Hulse Chair of Divinity at
Cambridge becoming the first non-Anglican Professor of Divinity at
both Universities. In 1936 he was elected a fellow of Jesus College
and became honorary fellow on his retirement from the chair in
1949." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

## On the atonement

Was Christ's work a propitiation or merely an expiation? The case
for translating *hilasterion* as "expiation" instead of
"[propitiation](Propitiation "Propitiation")" (e.g. in Romans 3:25)
was put forward by C. H. Dodd in 1935 and at first gained wide
support. As a result, *hilasterion* has been translated as
"expiation" in the RSV and other modern versions. Dodd argued that
in pagan Greek the translation of *hilasterion* was indeed to
propitiate, but that in the [Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint")
(the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament) that
*kapporeth* (Hebrew for "atone") is often translated with words
that mean "to cleanse or remove." ^[[2]](#note-1)^ This view was
challenged by [Leon Morris](Leon_Morris "Leon Morris") who argued
that because of the focus in the book of Romans on God's wrath,
that the concept of *hilasterion* needed to include the appeasement
of God's wrath. ^[[3]](#note-2)^

Some, like [Mark Dever](Mark_Dever "Mark Dever"), see Dodd's work
here as a conscious rejection of the idea of penal-substitution in
line with the Abelard and [Socinian](Socinianism "Socinianism")
critics of old. ^[[4]](#note-3)^
