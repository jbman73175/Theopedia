## British scholar

Lewis taught as a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford for nearly
thirty years, and later was the first Professor of Medieval and
Renaissance Literature at Cambridge University and a fellow of
Magdalene College, Cambridge. In spite of this position, he claimed
that there was no such thing as an English renaissance. Much of his
scholarly work concentrated on the later Middle Ages, especially
its use of allegory. His *The Allegory of Love* (1936) helped
reinvigorate the serious study of late medieval narratives like the
Roman de la Rose. Lewis wrote a preface to John Milton's poem
*Paradise Lost* which is still one of the more important critical
responses to that work. His last academic publication,
*The Discarded Image, an Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature*
(1964), is an excellent summary of the medieval world view, the
"discarded image" of the cosmos in his title.

## Author

Lewis was a prolific writer and a member of the literary discussion
society The Inklings with his close friends J. R. R. Tolkien,
Charles Williams, and Owen Barfield.

In addition to his scholarly work he wrote a number of popular
novels, including the "Space Trilogy" of science fiction books:
*Out of the Silent Planet*, *Perelandra* (also known by the pulpish
title Voyage to Venus), and *That Hideous Strength*. The trilogy
blends traditional science fiction elements with exploration of the
Christian themes of sin, fall, and redemption.

*The Great Divorce* is a short novel about imagined conversations
in [heaven](Heaven "Heaven") between the
[saved](Salvation "Salvation") and the damned. In the novel, those
who are 'damned' apparently damn themselves, in the sense that
nothing prevents them from going to heaven and staying there if
they choose. But some find the changes heaven induces threatening
or uncomfortable, and so decide to leave. The narrator is
chaperoned by the Scottish writer George MacDonald.

Another short novel, *The Screwtape Letters*, comprises letters of
advice from an elderly [demon](Demon "Demon") to his nephew. In the
letters, Screwtape, the elder demon, instructs his nephew,
Wormwood, on the best ways to secure the damnation of a particular
human.

*The Chronicles of Narnia* is a series of seven fantasy novels for
children that is by far the most popular of his works. The books
have a Christian theme and describe the adventures of a group of
children who visit a magical land called Narnia. The Lion, the
Witch, and the Wardrobe, which was the first published and the most
popular book of the series, has been adapted for both stage and
screen. The Chronicles of Narnia borrow from Greek and Roman
mythology, and traditional English and Irish fairy tales. Lewis
cited MacDonald as an influence in writing the series.

Lewis' last novel was *Till We Have Faces*. Many believe (as he
did) that it is his most mature and masterful work of fiction, but
it was never a popular success. It is a retelling of the myth of
Cupid and Psyche from the unusual perspective of Psyche's sister.
It is deeply concerned with religious ideas, but the setting is
entirely pagan, and the connections with specific Christian beliefs
are left implicit.

Prior to Lewis' conversion to Christianity, he published two books:
*Spirits in Bondage*, a collection of poems, and *Dymer*, a single
narrative poem. Both were published under the pen name of Clive
Hamilton.

## Writing on Christianity

In addition to his career as an English Professor, and his novels,
Lewis also wrote a number of books about Christianity -- perhaps
most famously, *Mere Christianity*. As an adult convert to the
[Anglican church](Anglicanism "Anglicanism") he was very much
interested in presenting a reasonable case for the truth of
Christianity. *Mere Christianity*, *The Problem of Pain*, and
*Miracles* were all concerned, to one degree or another, with
refuting popular objections to Christianity. He wrote an
autobiography entitled *Surprised by Joy*, which describes his
[conversion](Conversion "Conversion") (it was written before he met
his wife, Joy Gresham). His essays and public speeches on Christian
belief, many of which were collected in *God in the Dock*,
*The Weight of Glory* and *Other Addresses*, remain popular today
for their insights into [faith](Faith "Faith"). However, his
doctrine proves to be somewhat less than orthodox in multiple
areas.

### Doctrinal issues

-   Scripture (the Bible as myth) - from *The Problem of Pain*,
    pages 71,77, and *Miracles*, page 139

> "I have the deepest respect even for Pagan myths, still more for
> myths in Holy Scripture..."

> "What exactly happened when Man fell, we do not know; but if it is
> legitimate to guess, I offer the following picture – a 'myth' in
> the Socratic sense, a not unlikely tale..."

> "...the mythology chosen by God to be the vehicle of the earliest
> sacred truths, the first step in that process which ends in the New
> Testament where truth has become completely historical. Whether we
> can ever say with certainty where, in this process of
> crystallization, any particular Old Testament story falls, is
> another matter. I take it that the memoirs of David’s court come at
> one end of the scale and are scarcely less historical than St. Mark
> or Acts; and that the Book of Jonah is at the opposite end..."

-   Creation (theistic evolution) - from *The Problem of Pain*,
    pages 72,77,79

> "If by saying that man rose from brutality you mean simply that man
> is physically descended from animals, I have no objections... For
> long centuries God perfected the animal form which was to become
> the vehicle of humanity and the image of Himself... The creature
> may have existed for ages in this state before it became man... We
> do not know how many of these creatures God made, nor how long they
> continued in the Paradisal state..."

-   Salvation (more than one way to Christ) - from
    *Mere Christianity*, pages 57-58,176-177

> "Now before I became a Christian I was under the impression that
> the first thing Christians had to believe was one particular theory
> as to what the point of (Christ’s) dying was. According to that
> theory God wanted to punish men for having deserted and joined the
> Great Rebel, but Christ volunteered to be punished instead, and so
> God let us off. Now I admit that even this theory does not seem to
> me quite so immoral and so silly as it used to... Theories about
> Christ’s death are not Christianity: they are explanations about
> how it works."

> "There are people who do not accept the full Christian doctrine
> about Christ but who are so strongly attracted by Him that they are
> His in a much deeper sense than they themselves understand. There
> are people in other religions who are being led by God’s secret
> influence to concentrate on those parts of their religion which are
> in agreement with Christianity, and who thus belong to Christ
> without knowing it."

## Biographic interest

Recently there has been some interest in biographical material
concerning Lewis. This has resulted in several biographies
(including books written by close friends of Lewis, among them
Roger Lancelyn Green and George Sayer), at least one play about his
life, and a 1993 movie, titled *Shadowlands*, based on an original
stage and television play. The movie fictionalizes his relationship
with an American writer, Joy Gresham, whom he met and married in
London, only to watch her die slowly from bone cancer. Lewis' book
*A Grief Observed* describes his experience of bereavement, and
describes it in such a raw and personal fashion that Lewis
originally released it under the pseudonym "N. W. Clerk" to keep
readers from associating the book with him (ultimately too many
friends recommended the book to Lewis as a method for dealing with
his own grief, and he made his authorship public).

Lewis died on November 22, 1963, at the Oxford home he shared with
his brother, Warnie. He is buried in the Headington Quarry
Churchyard, Oxford, England. Media coverage of his death was
overshadowed by news of the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, which occurred on the same day.

Many books have been inspired by Lewis, including *A Severe Mercy*
by his correspondent Sheldon Vanauken, and numerous Narnia-inspired
novels by various hands.
