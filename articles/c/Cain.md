Lamech was the one of whom we read, in Genesis 4:19-24, Lamech
married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. Adah gave
birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and
raise livestock. His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of
all who play the harp and flute. Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain,
who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's
sister was Naamah. Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah,
listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man
for wounding me, a young man for injuring me. If Cain is avenged
seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."
