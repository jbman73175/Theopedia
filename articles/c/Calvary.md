**Calvary** is the name for the place where [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")
was crucified. It was probably a small hill just outside the walls
of ancient Jerusalem. According to church tradition, it was within
the area now occupied by The Church of the Holy
Sepulchre.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

The biblical name for Calvary is **Golgotha**, which is derived
from the Aramaic word *gulgulta*. Matthew 27:33, Mark 15:22, and
John 19:17 give its meaning as "place of the skull." When Saint
Jerome translated these verses into Latin, he used the Latin word
for skull, *calvaria*, which is the origin of the English word
Calvary.

The location of Calvary was identified by Empress Helena, mother of
Constantine the Great, in the early fourth century. It is near the
Holy Tomb.

The first churches built at the site were eventually destroyed in
wars. When the Crusaders gained control of Jerusalem in the
eleventh century, they constructed the present Church of the Holy
Sepulcher, which covers both the Tomb and the place of the
crucifixion.
