**Calvin Theological Seminary**, in Grand Rapids Michigan, was
founded in 1876 by the
[Christian Reformed Church](Christian_Reformed_Church "Christian Reformed Church"),
with which it maintains affiliation. The seminary is co-located
with Calvin College, though each institution has its own board. The
seminary was established to prepare students for ordained ministry
within the denomination, but also grants masterâ€™s degrees in other
subjects and trains people as evangelists, church planters,
ministers of education, youth pastors, and other specialized
ministries not requiring ordination.
