**Calvinism** is the theological system associated with the
Reformer [John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") that emphasizes
the rule of God over all things as reflected in its understanding
of [Scripture](Scripture "Scripture"), [God](God "God"),
[humanity](Humanity "Humanity"),
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation"), and the
[church](Church "Church"). In popular vernacular, Calvinism often
refers to the Five Points of Calvinistic doctrine regarding
salvation, which make up the acrostic [TULIP](TULIP "TULIP"). In
its broader sense, Calvinism is associated with
[Reformed theology](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology").

## Background

Calvinism is named after 16th century Reformer,
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") whose overall theology is
contained in his *Institutes of the Christian Religion* (1559).
Sometimes Calvinism is referred to by other names such as
"Augustinianism" because Calvin basically followed
[Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") (A.D. 354–430) in areas of
predestination and the sovereignty of God.

In a broad sense, Calvinism can be virtually synonymous with
"Reformed Protestantism" or
[Reformed theology](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology"),
encompassing the whole body of doctrine taught by
[Reformed churches](Reformed_churches "Reformed churches") and
represented in various Reformed Confessions such as the
[Belgic Confession of Faith](Belgic_Confession_of_Faith "Belgic Confession of Faith")
(1561) and the
[Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")
of Faith (1647).

## Scripture

The source of Calvin's system can be expressed by the term
*[Sola Scriptura](Sola_Scriptura "Sola Scriptura")* (Scripture
alone). This principle of the Reformation demonstrates the
conviction that the [Bible](Bible "Bible") is the Word of God and
therefore the *final* authority in belief and practice. A common
mistake is made when *Sola Scriptura* is understood as the Bible
"alone." Calvin and the Reformers, believed strongly in church
tradition, e.g. Calvin consistently and often cites the early
church fathers. However, Scripture had the final authority and
tradition was given a subordinate role. The authority of Scripture
was not through rational argumentation or proofs, but through the
witness of the Holy Spirit. ^[[1]](#note-0)^

*See main page: [Scripture alone](Scripture_alone "Scripture alone"), [Authority of the Bible](Authority_of_the_Bible "Authority of the Bible")*

## God

Calvinism affirms and confesses the historic
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"): God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[God](God "God") is perfect in all his
[attributes](Attributes_of_God "Attributes of God"), and is
self-sufficient. Therefore, God is not subject to time or other
beings, nor is he reducible to matter or spatial categories
available to human reasoning or examination. ^[[2]](#note-1)^ God
is also mysterious, or hidden, except as he chooses to reveal
himself to men, which He has done in the Scriptures.

## Salvation (Five Points of Calvinism)

The Calvinist doctrine of [salvation](Salvation "Salvation") is
summarized in what is commonly called the Five Points of Calvinism,
or the Doctrines of Grace, known by the acronym
[TULIP](TULIP "TULIP"). These five points are a summary of the
[Canons of Dort](Canons_of_Dort "Canons of Dort") which in turn was
the judgment of the [Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort")
(1618–1619) against related [Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism")
teaching. These five points are not intended to be a comprehensive
summary of Calvinism or Reformed doctrine, but an exposition of the
sovereignty of God in salvation -- arranged to address the
particular points in dispute raised by the Arminians of that day.

The summary wording below is adapted from the
[Center for Reformed Theology and Apologetics](http://www.reformed.org/calvinism/):

### Total depravity

Calvinism teaches that humanity is totally depraved. Due to
[the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall"), the original relationship that
[Adam](Adam "Adam") and [Eve](Eve "Eve") enjoyed with God was
severed by [sin](Sin "Sin"). This affected the entire human race,
corrupting the heart, mind, and will of every person born. Thus,
people's natural actions and affections, whether viewed by man as
bad or good, are never pleasing to God. The Calvinist understanding
of total depravity does not mean that people are as evil as they
possibly could be. People still make good choices (from a human
perspective), but no matter how good they may be, they never gain
favor with God. While total depravity is commonly associated with
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"), this theological
viewpoint is based on the theology of
[Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") (b. 354).

* See main page: [Total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity")*
* Contrast with [Universal prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace")*

### Unconditional election

Unconditional election is the doctrine which states that God chose
those whom he was pleased to bring to a knowledge of himself, not
based upon any merit shown by the object of his grace and not based
upon foreseen faith (especially a mere decisional faith). God has
[elected](Election "Election"), based solely upon the counsel of
his own will, some for glory and others for damnation (Romans 9:15,
21). He has done this act before the foundations of the world
(Ephesians 1:4–8).

* See main page: [Unconditional election](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election")*
* See also [Election](Election "Election"), [Predestination](Predestination "Predestination"), and [Foreknowledge of God](Foreknowledge_of_God "Foreknowledge of God")*

### Limited atonement

Limited atonement (also known as "definite atonement") is a
doctrine offered in answer to the question, "for whose sins did
Christ atone?" The Bible teaches that Christ died for those whom
God gave him to save (John 17:9). Christ died, indeed, for many
people, but not all (Matthew 26:28). Specifically, Christ died for
the invisible Church -- the sum total of all those who would ever
rightly bear the name "Christian" (Ephesians 5:25).

*See main page: [Definite atonement](Definite_atonement "Definite atonement")*
*See also [Atonement of Christ](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ") and [Penal substitutionary atonement](Penal_substitutionary_atonement "Penal substitutionary atonement")*

### Irresistible grace

The result of God's irresistible grace is the certain response by
the elect to the inward call of the Holy Spirit, when the outward
call is given by the evangelist or minister of the Word of God.
Christ, himself, teaches that all whom God has elected will come to
a knowledge of him (John 6:37). Men come to Christ in salvation
when the Father calls them (John 6:44), and the very Spirit of God
leads God's beloved to repentance (Romans 8:14). What a comfort it
is to know that the gospel of Christ will penetrate our hard,
sinful hearts and wondrously save us through the gracious inward
call of the Holy Spirit (1 Peter 5:10)!

* See main page: [Irresistible grace](Irresistible_grace "Irresistible grace")*
* See also [Faith](Faith "Faith"), [Repentance](Repentance "Repentance"), and [Regeneration](Regeneration "Regeneration")*

### Perseverance of the saints

Those called and justified will certainly be glorified (Romans
8:28–39). The work of sanctification which God has brought about in
his elect will continue until it reaches its fulfillment in eternal
life (Phil. 1:6). Christ assures the elect that he will not lose
them and that they will be glorified at the "last day" (John 6:39).
The Calvinist stands upon the Word of God and trusts in Christ's
promise that he will perfectly fulfill the will of the Father in
saving all the elect.

* See main page: [Perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints")*
* See also [Lordship salvation](Lordship_salvation "Lordship salvation") and [Assurance of salvation](Assurance_of_salvation "Assurance of salvation")*

## The Church

### Theology of the sacraments

Calvinists regard the sacraments as gracious gifts from Christ to
his church, the substance of the sacraments being Christ and their
benefits being appropriated by faith. They are memorial and
symbolic in nature, but not simply memorial and symbolic, as Jesus
is faithful to his promise. Thus, if a thing is signified by a
sacrament, he will certainly bestow the thing so signified on a
faithful participant, and indeed he himself will accompany the
sign. Consistent with
[Protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism") in general,
Calvinism acknowledges the two sacraments of
[Baptism](Baptism "Baptism") and the
[Lord's Supper](Lord's_Supper "Lord's Supper") as being
specifically instituted by Christ for the church.

* See main page: [Calvinism/Sacramentology](Calvinism/Sacramentology "Calvinism/Sacramentology")*

## The Five Solas of the Reformation

The [Five Solas](Five_Solas "Five Solas") of the Protestant
Reformation, while not unique to Calvinism, are integral to a
Calvinist theological perspective and therefore bear restating
here:

-   [Sola Fide](Sola_Fide "Sola Fide") - by faith alone, in
    specific reference to
    [Justification](Justification "Justification").
-   [Sola Scriptura](Sola_Scriptura "Sola Scriptura") - by the
    Scriptures alone, in reference to authority.
-   [Solus Christus](Solus_Christus "Solus Christus") - by Christ
    alone, as our sole mediator and intercessor before God.
-   [Sola gratia](Sola_gratia "Sola gratia") - by grace alone, in
    reference to [salvation](Salvation "Salvation").
-   [Soli Deo gloria](Soli_Deo_gloria "Soli Deo gloria") - to God
    alone the glory.
