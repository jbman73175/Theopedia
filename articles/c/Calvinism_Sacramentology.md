Reformed theology recognises certain means of grace, ordained by
Jesus for the benefit of the church. Among these are the two
sacraments, namely baptism and the Lord's Supper (Westminster
Larger Catechism 154, 164).

## Sacraments

### Background

The Westminster Larger Catechism summarises the classic Reformed
view thus:

**What is a sacrament?**
A sacrament is a holy ordinance instituted by Christ in his church,
to signify, seal, and exhibit unto those that are within the
covenant of grace, the benefits of his mediation; to strengthen and
increase their faith, and all other graces; to oblige them to
obedience; to testify and cherish their love and communion one with
another; and to distinguish them from those that are without. (WLC
162)
Since Abraham, if not earlier, the people of God have been given
outward signs as a part of his covenant with them. These have
signified Christ and his work as the mediator of the covenant, by
shadows and types in the old covenants, and by fulfilment and
revelation in the New Covenant. Reformed theology sees continuity
between circumcision in the Abrahamic and, by extension, Mosaic
covenants and baptism in the New; and between the Passover and the
sacrificial system in the Old Covenant and the Lord's Supper in the
New.

### Administration

The sacraments are gifts of Christ to the Church Universal, and it
is thus appropriate that the sacraments be administered in a local
gathering of the Church and that those who preside over their
administration be ordained in the church. As regards modes and
means, Reformed churches, following the Regulative Principle of
Worship, believe that the sacraments ought to be administered
according to the New Testament pattern.

### Significance

The sacraments are signs and seals of God's grace to the church.
They provide a symbolic reminder of what Jesus has done for us and
are thus visible signs of the gospel of grace. Furthermore, by
receiving the sacraments, we receive no less than Christ himself,
who is, as Calvin put it, "the substance of all the sacraments,
since in him they have their solidity" (Institutes 4:14.16). To
those who receive the sacrament faithfully, he brings life and
grace, but to the wicked who receive the sacrament, he brings death
and judgment.

Right use of the sacraments will also result in a deeper and
stronger faith for all involved, as well as calling us once again
to the lives we are to lead under the Master. Finally, as the
sacraments have been given to the church, so their proper use will
lead to the strengthening of the church, both locally and
universally.

## Baptism

*Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.*
(Mat. 28:19)
### Administration

Baptism according to the New Testament pattern involves the use of
water in the getting of the candidate wet. Most Christians will
accept immersion as a valid mode of baptism, and many Reformed
Christians also argue for sprinkling as a valid mode of baptism.

Historically, Reformed Christianity has held that "not only those
that do actually profess faith in and obedience unto Christ, but
also the infants of one, or both, believing parents, are to be
baptized." (WCF 28.4) There is also a tradition of Reformed
Christianity which argues that only believers should be baptized,
and that baptism ought only be by immersion.

### Significance

The sacrament of baptism marks the entry of the candidate into the
church of God, and does so by pointing to Christ and his work. As
the candidate is joined to the water in baptism, he attests to the
work of the Spirit in his union with Christ, specifically,
declaring that he is united to Christ in his death, burial and
resurrection (Rom. 6:3-5) and also of Christ's washing away of sins
by his blood (Tit. 3:4-5). The candidate's knowledge and certainty
of God's gracious gifts of forgiveness, salvation and union with
Christ may be said to be sealed in this manner.

## The Lord's Supper

*And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."*
*And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood."*
(Luke 22:19-20)
### Administration

Jesus in his institution and Paul in his teaching make it plain
that the Lord's Supper is a corporate activity given to the Church.
In recognition of its corporate nature, and following Paul's
teaching in 1 Corinthians 12, most Reformed churches will remind
believers of the necessity to examine oneself before taking
Communion.

Some Reformed churches practise closed communion, requiring that
people wishing to participate present themselves to the leadership
with certain credentials; others leave the Table open to all who
wish to participate. Most Reformed churches reserve the right to
suspend members from the Table, if they be living in open and
persistent sin.

The elements used vary somewhat from church to church. Some
Reformed churches will use bread and wine, while others, in
deference to the views of teetotallers and recognising the
struggles of recovered alcoholics, use bread and grape juice.

### Significance

The Lord's Supper is first a commemoration and proclamation of the
Lord's death. The bread represents his body, and the wine, his
blood. Moreover, as we physically receive earthly bread and wine,
we spiritually receive the bread of heaven, Jesus' own body and
blood, which he himself tells us "is true food, and ... true
drink." (John 6:55)

As we partake of the body and blood of the Lord, we do so as the
body of Christ, his church. We therefore proclaim our unity in him
and strengthen our bonds of love and fellowship.

Moreover, by participating in this memorial of the Lord and
nourishing ourselves on him by faith, we are reminded not only that
he died, but that he rose again and now reigns at the right hand of
the Father, so looking to the day when he will return, and when we
shall no longer perceive him dimly in the sacraments, but rather
see him face to face.
