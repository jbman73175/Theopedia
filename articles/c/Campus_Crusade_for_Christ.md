# History

Campus Crusade for Christ was founded in 1951 by a young Fuller
Theological Seminary student named
[Bill Bright](index.php?title=Bill_Bright&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bill Bright (page does not exist)")
to reach the University of Callifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus.
What began as a small outreach by Mr. Bright and his wife Vonette
of the Hollywood Presbyterian Church, has since grown into one of
the largest Evangelical Christian ministries in the world with
approximately 24,000 full time staff globally and with a ministry
presence in 171 countries (representing 98% of the world's
population). Campus Crusade has grown beyond their ministry scope
of the college campus into over 50 distinct specialized
ministries.

# Organizational Purpose

Campus Crusade for Christ's self stated purpose is to spread the
Gospel of Jesus Christ to all nations. This is accomplished through
a strategy known as "Win, Build, Send"- **Winning** disciples to
Jesus Christ, **Building** them in the faith, and **Sending** them
into the world to make more disciples. The concept of
[Spiritual Multiplication](index.php?title=Spiritual_Multiplication&action=edit&redlink=1 "Spiritual Multiplication (page does not exist)")
is commonly stressed as a part of the organization's ministry
philosophy.

# Theological Distinctives

The theological distinctives of Campus Crusade for Christ could be
best described as 'broadly evangelical' with a variety of views
being represented amongst the organization's staff ranging from
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism"),
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed"),
[Wesleyan](index.php?title=Wesleyan&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wesleyan (page does not exist)"),
and
[Charismatic](Charismatic "Charismatic")/[Pentecostal](Pentecostal "Pentecostal").
However, even with such diversity of views, all Campus Crusade
Staff are required to subscribe to the organization's
[Statement of Faith](http://www.ccci.org/statement_of_faith.html),
which stresses "areas of doctrinal teaching on which, historically,
there has been general agreement among all true Christians". These
areas include justification by faith alone, the divinity and virgin
birth of Christ, the Godhead as Triune, and inerrancy of
scripture.

## Justification

Campus Crusade publishes and utilizes a tract known as
["Have You Heard of the Four Spiritual Laws?"](http://www.greatcom.org/laws/languages.html)
to explain their particular view of justification by faith and as
an evangelical tool. This tool has been modified over the years and
is published a variety of forms such as
["Would You Like to Know God Personally?"](http://www.greatcom.org/laws/englishkgp/default.htm)
and ["Good News"](http://www.ccci.org/good-news/index.html) which
has been written for children in comic book form.

## The Ministry of Holy Spirit

Until the mid 1990s, Campus Crusade held to a modified
[Keswick](index.php?title=Keswick&action=edit&redlink=1 "Keswick (page does not exist)")
view of sanctification as evidenced in their tract
["Have You Made the Wonderful Discovery of the Spirit-Filled Life?"](http://www.jesuswho.org/english/spirit.htm).
However, this booklet was replaced in the late 1990s, by
["Satisfied?"](http://www.godsquad.com/discipleship/satisfied.htm),
which intentionally allows for the same concept (believers need to
walk by faith by the power of the Holy Spirit), but allowing for
interpretation from a Keswick or non-Keswick theological stance by
shifting the focus of the document from man's status (natural,
spiritual, or carnal) to man's placement of faith (in himself, or
in God).
