The **Canons of Dordt** constitute the judgment of the
[Synod of Dordt](Synod_of_Dordt "Synod of Dordt") held in the Dutch
city of Dordrecht in 1618-1619.

These canons are in actuality a judicial decision on the doctrinal
points in dispute from the [Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism")
controversy of that day. Following the death of
[Jacobus Arminius](Jacobus_Arminius "Jacobus Arminius")
(1560-1609), his followers set forth a
[Five articles of Remonstrance](Five_articles_of_Remonstrance "Five articles of Remonstrance")
(published in 1610) formulating their points of departure from the
stricter Calvinism of the
[Belgic Confession](Belgic_Confession "Belgic Confession"). The
Canons of Dordt is the judgment of the Synod against this
Remonstrance. However, Arminian theology later received official
toleration by the State and has since continued in various forms
within Protestantism.

The Canons were not intended to be a comprehensive explanation of
Reformed doctrine, but only an exposition on the five points of
doctrine in dispute. These Canons set forth what is often referred
to as the [Five Points of Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"). Today,
the Canons of Dordt form one of the confessional standards of many
of the [Reformed churches](Reformed_churches "Reformed churches")
around the world, including the Netherlands, Australia, and North
America.
