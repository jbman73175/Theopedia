The **Cappadocian Fathers** consist of
[Basil the Great](Basil_the_Great "Basil the Great"), his younger
brother [Gregory of Nyssa](Gregory_of_Nyssa "Gregory of Nyssa"),
and
[Gregory of Nazianzus](Gregory_of_Nazianzus "Gregory of Nazianzus")
(also called "Gregory the Theologian"). Basil became bishop of
Caesarea in Cappadocia in 370; Gregory of Nyssa, the most
philosophical of the three, was appointed bishop of Nyssa in 372;
Gregory of Nazianzus, the theologian, was made bishop of
Constantinople in 381.
