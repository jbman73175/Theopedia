Carl F. H. Henry
**Carl F. H. Henry** (1913-2003) was a Christian theologian and the
first Dean of
[Fuller Theological Seminary](Fuller_Theological_Seminary "Fuller Theological Seminary")
in 1947. He was also the founder of the magazine
*[Christianity Today](Christianity_Today "Christianity Today")* in
1956, and is regarded by many as the father of
[neo-evangelicalism](Neo-evangelicalism "Neo-evangelicalism").
Receiving both bachelors and masters degrees from Wheaton College,
he then earned a Doctor of Theology degree from Northern Baptist
Theological Seminary and finally a PhD from Boston University in
1949.

In *The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism* (1947), Carl
Henry deals with [Fundamentalism](Fundamentalism "Fundamentalism")
as an "object of surgery" and suggests a direction where
new-evangelicalism should go.

In 1978 he published *The Christian Mindset In a Secular Society*
and signed the
[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy](Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy "Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy"),
which affirmed the [inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy") of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible").

His magnum opus is his six-volume *God, Revelation, and Authority*
(completed in 1983), which has perhaps the fullest exposition of
the [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of biblical
[inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy").
