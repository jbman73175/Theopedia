**Cataphatic theology** describes God *positively* according to
what He has revealed of Himself in Scripture and nature. It is
usually discussed as the opposite of
[Apophatic](Negative_theology "Negative theology") (or negative)
theology, which attempts to describe God only in terms of what He
is not.
