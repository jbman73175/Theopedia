The **Catholic Reformation** or the **Counter Reformation** was a
strong reaffirmation of the doctrine and structure of the
[Catholic Church](Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"), climaxing at
the [Council of Trent](Council_of_Trent "Council of Trent"), partly
in reaction to the growth of
[Protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism"). Even before the
posting of [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther")'s
[Ninety-Five Theses](95_Theses "95 Theses") in 1517, there had been
evidence of internal reform within the Church, combating trends
that heightened radical demands to fundamentally alter the
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") and structure of the Medieval
Church and even contributed to the anticlericalism of figures such
as [John Huss](John_Huss "John Huss") and
[John Wycliffe](John_Wycliffe "John Wycliffe") in the late
fourteenth century. The Catholic Reformation, aimed at correcting
the sources of the [Reformation](Reformation "Reformation"), and
pronounced since the pontificate of Pope Paul III, was both
retaliatory, committed to protecting Catholic institutions and
practices from [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") and Protestantism, but
also reformist, committed to reform the Church from within to stem
the growing appeal of Protestantism. Broadly speaking, the Catholic
Reformation, represented a three-sided strategy: an autocratic
church at the top linked to the individual by the parish church.
The Catholic Reformation was a strong reaffirmation of the doctrine
and structure of the Medieval Church, presiding over reforms that
would preserve its effectiveness.

## The Council of Trent

The pontificate of Paul III (1534-1549) culminated in the
[Council of Trent](Council_of_Trent "Council of Trent"), who
appointed a commission of cardinals to look into the need for
institutional, but certainly not doctrinal, reform, uncovering the
appointment of corrupt and worldly bishops and priests, traffic in
indulgences, and other financial abuses. The Council of Trent,
meeting in three sessions between 1545 and 1563, was the climax of
the Catholic Reformation. The Council clearly repudiated specific
Protestant positions and upheld the basic structure of the Medieval
Church, its sacramental system, religious orders, and doctrine. It
rejected all compromise with the Protestants, restating basic
tenants of Catholicism. The Council, using vehicles such as the
[Tridentine Creed](Tridentine_Creed "Tridentine Creed"), strongly
reaffirmed as spiritually vital:

-   the dogma of salvation by faith and works,
-   the authority of unwritten tradition,
-   [transubstantiation](Transubstantiation "Transubstantiation")
    of the consecrated bread and wine into the substantial body and
    blood of Christ,
-   seven [sacraments](Sacraments "Sacraments")
-   indulgences,
-   pilgrimages,
-   the cult of saints, relics, and the Virgin.

## Reform

While the basic structure of the Church was reaffirmed, there were
noticeable changes to answer complaints that the Catholic Reformers
tacitly were willing to admit were legitimate. Among the conditions
to be corrected by Catholic reformers was the growing divide
between the priests and the flock; many members of the clergy in
the rural parishes, after all, had been poorly educated. Often,
these rural priests did not know Latin and lacked opportunities for
theological education at the time. (Addressing the education of
priests had been a fundamental focus of the humanist reformers in
the past.) Parish priests now became better educated, while Papal
authorities sought to eliminate the distractions of the monastic
churches. Notebooks and handbooks thus became common, describing
how to be good priests and confessors.

In addition, between 1512 and the 1560s a movement of 'evangelical
Catholics' of high-ranking member of the curia, called Spirituali,
actively tried to reform the church through reform of the
individual. Members of orders active in overseas missionary
expansionism often expressed the need that the rural parishes,
whose poor state of affairs contributed to the growth of
Protestantism, often needed Christianizing as much as heathens of
Asia and the Americas, thus contributing to recovering significant
territories that would have otherwise been lost to the Protestants.
The Ursulines focused on the special task of educating girls. and
other Protestant sects. Not only making the Church more effective,
they reaffirmed fundamental premises of the Medieval Church.
