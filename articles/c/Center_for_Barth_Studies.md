The **Center for Barth Studies**, also known as the
**Barth Center**, was established at Princeton Theological Seminary
(PTS) in 1997. The Karl Barth Research Collection is seeking an
exhaustive collection of writings by and on the Swiss theologian,
[Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth") (1886-1968). The center also
sponsors conferences, research opportunities, and discussion
groups.

[George Hunsinger](George_Hunsinger "George Hunsinger") was the
first director of the center.
