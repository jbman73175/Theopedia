**Cessationism**, in Christian theology, is the view that the
miraculous gifts of the Spirit, such as healing, tongues, and
prophetic revelation, pertained to the apostolic era only, served a
purpose that was unique to establishing the early church, and
passed away before the canon of Scripture was closed (comp. 1 Cor.
13:8-12 with Heb. 2:3-4). It is contrasted with
[continuationism](Continuationism "Continuationism"), which is the
view that the miraculous gifts are normative, have not ceased, and
are available for the believer today.
