The **Chalcedonian Creed** was adopted at the
[Council of Chalcedon](Council_of_Chalcedon "Council of Chalcedon")
in 451 in Asia Minor as a response to certain heretical views
concerning the nature of Christ. This Council of Chalcedon is the
fourth of the seven
[ecumenical councils](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils")
accepted by Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and many Protestant
Christian churches. It is the first Council *not* recognized by any
of the [Oriental Orthodox](Oriental_Orthodox "Oriental Orthodox")
churches.

The Chalcedonian Creed was written amid controversy between the
western and eastern churches over the meaning of the
[incarnation](Incarnation "Incarnation") (see
[Christology](Christology "Christology")), the ecclesiastical
influence of the Byzantine emperor, and the supremacy of the Roman
Pope. The western churches readily accepted the creed, but some
eastern churches did not. The adopted Creed specifically maintained
the two distinct natures of Christ (divine and human) over against
teaching of Eutyches -- that Christ had only one nature, a mixture
of human and divine. [Eutychianism](Eutychianism "Eutychianism") is
also known as [monophysitism](Monophysitism "Monophysitism") from
monos (single) and physis (nature), which confuses both Christâ€™s
true humanity and his true deity.

## An English translation of the Creed

We, then, following the holy Fathers, all with one consent, teach
men to confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the
same perfect in Godhead and also perfect in manhood; truly God and
truly man, of a reasonable soul and body; consubstantial with us
according to the manhood; in all things like unto us, without sin;
begotten before all ages of the Father according to the Godhead,
and in these latter days, for us and for our salvation, born of the
virgin Mary, the mother of God, according to the manhood; one and
the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, to be acknowledged in
two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably;
the distinction of natures being by no means taken away by the
union, but rather the property of each nature being preserved, and
concurring in one Person and one Subsistence, not parted or divided
into two persons, but one and the same Son, and only begotten, God
the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ, as the prophets from the beginning
have declared concerning him, and the Lord Jesus Christ himself
taught us, and the Creed of the holy Fathers has handed down to us.
