**Charismatic** is an umbrella term used to describe those
Christians who believe that the manifestations of the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") seen in the first century
Christian Church, such as healing, miracles and "speaking in
tongues," are available to contemporary Christians and ought to be
experienced and practiced today.

The word *charismatic* is derived from the Greek word
*[charisma](Charisma "Charisma")* (meaning a grace or a gift) which
is the term used in the [Bible](Bible "Bible") to describe a wide
range of supernatural experiences (especially in 1 Corinthians
12-14).

Often confused with
[Pentecostalism](Pentecostalism "Pentecostalism") (by which it was
inspired), Charismatic Christianity tends to differ in key aspects:
most Charismatics reject the preeminence given by Pentecostalism to
"speaking in tongues," reject what they consider to be
[legalism](Legalism "Legalism") sometimes associated with
Pentecostalism, and often stay in their existing denominations such
as Roman Catholic Charismatics.

Because of the continual cross-over between Pentecostalism and the
modern Charismatic movement, it is increasingly difficult to speak
of Charismatics and Pentecostals as being part of separate
movements. Yet because neither movement is monolithic, it is also
unfair to speak of them as being one movement either. The
difference is primarily one of origins. Beliefs of the two groups
are very similar; each movement, however, is unique in its
historical beginnings. Having been conceived in unique contexts,
the difference may secondarily be described in terms of contrasting
church cultures evidenced through each movement's manners and
customs (i.e., worship styles, preaching styles, altar ministry
methods). Until a more acceptable broad nomenclature is used, it
needs to be understood that both movements share a great deal in
common, and yet can sometimes be clearly differentiated.

## History

### Beginnings 1950-1975

While it is difficult to locate the place and time that Charismatic
Christianity began to influence the mainstream churches, Dennis
Bennett, an American Episcopalian, is often cited as the movement's
seminal influence. Bennett was the Rector at St Mark's Episcopal
Church in Van Nuys California when he announced to the congregation
in 1960 that he had received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
Soon after this he was ministering in Vancouver where he ran many
workshops and seminars about the work of the Holy
Spirit.[[1]](http://www3.telus.net/st_simons/arm12.htm) This
influenced tens of thousands of Anglicans world-wide and also began
a renewal movement within the Roman Catholic and Orthodox
churches.

In the 1960s and 1970s there was a renewed interest in the
supernatural gifts of the Spirit in mainstream churches such as the
Episcopal, Lutheran and Catholic churches. The Catholic Charismatic
Renewal was focused in individuals like Kevin Ranaghan and his
group of followers at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend,
Indiana. Dennis Bennett was Ranaghan's counterpart in the Episcopal
Church.

The Charismatic Renewal movement in the Eastern Orthodox Church
never exerted the influence that it did in other mainstream
churches. Individual priests, such as Fr. Eusebius Stephanouof the
Greek Orthodox Orthodox Archdiocese of North America, founder of
the Brotherhood of St. Symeon the New Theologian, Fr. Athanasius
Emmert of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese and Fr.
Boris Zabrodsky of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in America,
founder of the Orthodox Spiritual Renewal Services and editor of
"[Theosis](Theosis "Theosis")" journal, were the more prominent
leaders of the Charismatic renewal in Orthodoxy.

On an international level, David du Plessis along with a host of
others (including Lutheran and even Southern Baptist ministers)
promoted the movement. The latter did not last long with their
denominations, either volunteering to leave or being asked to do
so. But in the Episcopal and Catholic churches priest and ministers
were permitted to continue on in their parishes, provided they did
not allow these concerns to create major divisions within their
congregations.

### Change 1975-2000

While there are many charismatics within established denominations,
many have left or have been forced out and have joined either more
progressive Pentecostal churches or formed their own churches or
denominations. The house church movement in the UK and the
[Vineyard Movement](Vineyard_Movement "Vineyard Movement") in the
USA are examples of a formal Charismatic structure. The Hillsong
Church in Australia is an example of a Pentecostal church that has
embraced Charismatic belief and practices, which has, in turn,
influenced the Australian
[Assemblies of God](Assemblies_of_God "Assemblies of God")
denomination. In New Zealand, the pre-eminent Pentecostal movement
has been the New Life Churches, although other local and
international Pentecostal denominations are also well established.

Since the mid 1980s, the Charismatic movement has made some notable
changes in its theology and emphases. This process has been termed
*The Third Wave of the Holy Spirit* and has been typified by the
ministry of C. Peter Wagner,
[Word of Faith](Word_of_Faith "Word of Faith") Theology and the
Toronto blessing phenomenon. Some opponents of the Charismatic
movement have noted that these recent trends have been influenced
heavily by the
[Latter Rain Movement](Latter_Rain_Movement "Latter Rain Movement")
of the 1950s within the Pentecostal churches â€” a movement that was
officially declared [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") by The Assemblies of
God at the time.

There appears to be a great deal of evidence which shows that,
since 1975, the Charismatic movement has been influenced by the
Latter Rain Movement and its influential teachers (such as William
M. Branham).
^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
This can be explained by the desire of Charismatic Christians to
enter into fellowship with those within the church who have
experienced similar forms of Religious ecstasy. As a result of
this, Charismatics came into contact with both mainstream
Pentecostalism as well as the Latter Rain Movement. It appears that
modern-day Charismatics and Pentecostals are far more united in
experience and theology because both movements have adopted
elements of Latter Rain teachings.

## Theological distinctives

Because the Charismatic movement is not monolithic, it cannot
easily be examined or judged as one entity. As a result, vast
theological differences can be found in the movement, with some
parts appearing to have quite orthodox beliefs while others seem to
embrace more heterodox ideas. Some charismatic groups such as
newfrontiers lead by [Terry Virgo](Terry_Virgo "Terry Virgo") are
Reformed in their theology.

Virtually all Charismatic Christians believe that the presence of
God can be experienced in a supernatural way by believers, usually
during times of intense spiritual reflection (such as during a
worship service, a small group meeting or personal prayer). The
singing of praise songs is an important element in this belief.

Nevertheless, there are two primary beliefs which define the
charismatic movement. The first is the belief that the "charismatic
gifts" of the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit"), such as
tongues, prophecy, and miraculous healing, are still in effect
today. Charismatics also hold that sometimes Bible passages are
misinterpreted in order to declare that charismatic gifts are not
valid for today's believers.

The second is the belief that the
[Baptism of the Holy Spirit](Baptism_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Baptism of the Holy Spirit")
is separate from both [salvation](Salvation "Salvation") and water
[baptism](Baptism "Baptism"). Both of these primary beliefs are
characteristic of the Pentecostal movement as well, but are less
dogmatically held by Charismatics. Many Charismatics, while they
may experience "speaking in tongues," may not view this as being
the Pentecostal phenomenon of Spirit Baptism.

Some Charismatic groups are more
[Fundamentalist](Fundamentalism "Fundamentalism"), while some are
less so. These churches, movements and groups all have in common
that they believe and promote the supernatural manifestations of
the Spirit in their meetings and lives.
