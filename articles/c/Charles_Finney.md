Charles Finney
**Charles G. Finney** (1792-1875) often viewed as the father of
modern revivalism, ministered in the wake of the "Second
Awakening," as it has been called. A
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") lawyer, Finney one day
experienced "a mighty [baptism](Baptism "Baptism") of the
[Holy Ghost](Holy_Ghost "Holy Ghost")" which "like a wave of
electricity going through and through me ... seemed to come in
waves of liquid love." The next morning, he informed his first
client of the day, "I have a retainer from the Lord
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") to plead his cause and
I cannot plead yours." Refusing to attend Princeton Seminary (or
any seminary, for that matter), Finney began conducting revivals in
upstate New York. One of his most popular sermons was "Sinners
Bound to Change Their Own Hearts."

"Finney’s one question for any given teaching was, "Is it fit to
convert sinners with?" One result of Finney’s revivalism was the
division of Presbyterians in Philadelphia and New York into
[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") and
[Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") factions. His "New Measures"
included the "anxious bench" (precursor to today’s altar call),
emotional tactics that led to fainting and weeping, and other
"excitements," as Finney and his followers called them."

"In Finney’s theology,
[God is not sovereign](Sovereignty_of_God "Sovereignty of God"),
[man is not a sinner by nature](Original_sin "Original sin"), the
[atonement](Atonement "Atonement") is not a true payment for sin,
[justification](Justification "Justification") by
[imputation](Imputation "Imputation") is insulting to reason and
morality, the [new birth](Regeneration "Regeneration") is simply
the effect of successful techniques, and revival is a natural
result of clever campaigns."
