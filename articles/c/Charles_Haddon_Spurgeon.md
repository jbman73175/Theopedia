## Brief biography

Born in Kelvedon, Essex, Spurgeon was converted at the age of
fifteen in January, 1850. On his way to a scheduled appointment, a
snow storm forced him to cut short his intended journey and turn in
to a Primitive Methodist chapel in Colchester where, in his own
words: "God opened his heart to the salvation message."

He preached his first sermon in 1851 at age sixteen. In 1852 he was
called to pastor of the small [Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") church
at Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, and in 1854, just four years after
his conversion, Spurgeon, then only 20, was called to the pastorate
of London's famed New Park Street Chapel, Southwark (formerly
pastored by the strict Baptist theologian
[John Gill](John_Gill "John Gill")). Within a few months of his
call his powers as a preacher made him famous.

The congregation quickly outgrew their building, moved to Exeter
Hall, then to Surrey Music Hall. In these venues Spurgeon
frequently preached to audiences numbering more than 10,000 — all
in the days before electronic amplification. At twenty-two Spurgeon
was the most popular preacher of the day.

In 1861 the congregation moved permanently to the newly constructed
purpose-built Metropolitan Tabernacle at Elephant and Castle,
seating five thousand people with standing room for another
thousand. Some say that the Metropolitan Tabernacle is considered
the first modern so-called "megachurch."

Spurgeon was a [Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") and a
[Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism"), but is still known to
[non-conformists](Nonconformist "Nonconformist") of many
denominations as the "Prince of Preachers" in the tradition of the
[Puritans](Puritan "Puritan") and especially highly regarded among
[Presbyterians](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") and
Congregationalists, although he differed with them over the issue
of [baptism](Baptism "Baptism").

Spurgeon's sermons were published in printed form every week, and
enjoyed a high circulation. By the time of his death in 1892, he
had preached almost thirty-six hundred sermons and published
forty-nine volumes of commentaries, sayings, anecdotes,
illustrations, and devotions.

In 1856, Spurgeon married Susannah, daughter of Robert Thompson of
Falcon Square, London, by whom he had twin sons, Charles and
Thomas. His widow and sons survived him. He suffered ill health
towards the end of his life, suffering from a combination of
rheumatism, gout and Bright's disease, often recuperating at
Mentone, near Nice, France, where he died in 1892.
