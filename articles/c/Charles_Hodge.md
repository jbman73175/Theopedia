Charles Hodge
"**Charles Hodge** [1797-1898], an American Presbyterian
theologian, was ordained in 1821, and taught at Princeton for
almost his whole life. In 1825 he founded the Biblical Repository
and Princeton Review, and during forty years was its editor, and
the principal contributor to its pages. He received the degree of
D.D. from Rutgers College in 1834, and that of LL.D. from
Washington College, Pennsylvania, in 1864. In 1840 Dr. Hodge was
transferred to the chair of didactic theology, retaining still,
however, the department of New Testament exegesis, the duties of
which he continued to discharge until his death.

"His most important works are his commentaries on Romans (1835),
Ephesians (1856), 1 Corinthians (1857), 2 Corinthians (1859), as
well as Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the
United States (2 vols., 1839-40), Systematic Theology (3 vols.,
1871-3), and What is Darwinism? (1874). He was an outstanding
defender of Calvinism, and has a claim to be considered one of the
best theologians and Bible commentators America has produced."
