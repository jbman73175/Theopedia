**Charles Lwanga**, a young page in the royal court of Buganda (now
part of Uganda), was burned to death in 1886 at the order of King
Mwanga, after refusing to renounce his faith in Jesus Christ.
Lwanga, who was in his mid twenties, had become the protector and
pastor to a group of young men who worked in the royal court, many
of whom had been led to faith and baptized by him. Mwanga's wrath
was fueled by what he perceived to be divided loyalty among the
pages because of their devotion to God and their growing
unwillingness, under Lwanga's guidance, to submit to his homosexual
abuse. Mwanga ordered twenty nine pages, including Lwanga, to
parade before him to recant their faith or die. Three recanted, and
the remaining twenty six were sent out to be burnt alive.

The deaths ignited astonishing growth in Buganda, so that 25 years
after the martyrdoms 40% of the tribe had been baptized. Bugandan
missionaries in turn spread the gospel to the rest of East Africa
and the whole continent.

## Background

The African kingdom of Buganda was "discovered" by British
explorer, J. H. Speke in 1862 and visited by Henry M. Stanley, a
British journalist, in 1875. Both Speke and Stanley wrote books
that praised the Baganda for their organizational skills, massive
army and navy, and willingness to modernize. Stanley described a
town of about 40,000 surrounding the king's palace, which was
situated atop a commanding hill. He noted a corps of young pages
who served the king while training to become future chiefs.

Anglican and Roman Catholic missionaries soon followed, as well as
Arab muslims. Mutesa allowed his people to join any religion, but
he remained a traditionalist. By the mid 1880s there had been
substantial conversions among the Baganda, especially in the royal
court, where the missionaries had focused their attention for
strategic reasons. When Mutesa died and was succeeded by his son
Mwanga, however, the cost of being a Christian rose dramatically
and tragically.

## Lwanga's life

Charles Lwanga was born around 1860 in Ssmgo County and was raised
in Buddu in the southwest. At age 18, Lwanga started working for
the chief of Kirwanyi and travelled with him to the capital of
Buganda in 1880. Lwanga became interested in the teaching of the
Catholic missionaries and began to attend their instructions. When
freed from service to the chief, Lwanga joined a group of recently
baptised Christians in Bulemezi County.

When Mwanga became king in 1884, Lwanga entered his royal service.
A natural leader, he was immediately put in charge of the royal
pages and quickly won their confidence and affection, not least
because of his skill as a wrestler. Lwanga understood his job to be
to give instruction and guidance to the royal pages and shield them
from the evil influences at court. With his encouragement and under
his mentorship, many pages turned to Christ.

## The martyrdoms

King Mwanga was concerned that the converts had diverted their
loyalty to some other authority so that he could no longer rely on
their allegiance at all costs. The ultimate humiliation for him was
that they resisted his homosexual advances – it was unheard of for
mere pages to reject the wishes of a king. Mwanga was thus
determined to rid his kingdom of the new teaching and its
followers.

The first three martyrs were killed at Busega Natete on January 31,
1885. The executions reached their peak with the death of Lwanga
and twenty five other "Ugandan Martyrs" on June 3, 1886. Lwanga was
burned first and burned more slowly to increase the suffering.
Throughout most of it he prayed quietly, and just before the end,
he cried out in a loud voice \`Katonda,' – \`My God.' By Jan 27,
1887, when the last death in Mwanga's campaign occurred, a total of
at least
[forty five young Africans](http://www.buganda.com/martyrs.htm) had
been killed.

## Impact of the martyrs

The martyrdoms drove the infant East African church underground but
not into retreat. There was dramatic growth in the churches, even
during the oppression. More people were baptized than martyred, and
at the very peak of the terror, congregations of fifty and more
attended services
[[1]](http://www.bethel.edu/~letnie/AfricanChristianity/SSAUganda.html).
Within two months of Lwanda's death, Anglicans had baptized two
hundred and twenty-seven people, and the Catholics may well have
baptized even more. Baptisms included prominent members of the
royal court such as the admiral of the fleet.

The oppression eased in 1888 when Mwanga was deposed, but the
astonishing growth continued. Soon the missionaries were far
outnumbered by local church leaders, and church growth was led by
the Africans. In the 1890s revival swept the Ugandan Protestant
community, which then sent out large numbers of missionary
evangelists. Their work was so successful that Baganda was 40%
Christian and the rest of Uganda 7% Christian by 1911, ready for
the even more dramatic
[East African Revival](index.php?title=East_African_Revival&action=edit&redlink=1 "East African Revival (page does not exist)")
that began in 1929.
