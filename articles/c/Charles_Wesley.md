**Charles Wesley** (Dec 18, 1707 - 1788) was a leader of the
[Methodist](Methodism "Methodism") movement, the younger brother of
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley"). Charles Wesley is chiefly
remembered for the many [hymns](Hymns "Hymns") he wrote.

Like his brother, he was born in Epworth, Lincolnshire in England,
where their father was rector. He was educated at Christ Church
College, Oxford, where his brother had also studied, and formed the
"Oxford Methodist" group among his fellow students in 1729. John
Wesley later joined this group, as did
[George Whitefield](George_Whitefield "George Whitefield"). Charles
followed his father and brother into the church in 1735, and
travelled with John to Georgia in North America in the entourage of
the governor, James Oglethorpe, returning a year later. In 1749, he
married the much younger Sarah Gwynne, daughter of a Welsh
gentleman who had been converted to Methodism. She accompanied the
brothers on their evangelical journeys throughout Britain, until
Charles ceased to travel in 1765.

Despite their closeness, Charles and his brother did not always
agree on questions relating to their beliefs. In particular,
Charles was strongly opposed to the idea of a breach with the
Church of England into which they had been ordained. He opposed
John when John chose to begin ordaining pastors for American
Methodism.

### Wesley as hymn-writer

In the course of his career, Charles Wesley wrote over
five-thousand [hymns](Hymns "Hymns"), many of which are still
popular. These include:

-   "Amazing Love"
-   "Christ Whose Glory Fills the Skies"
-   "Come, Thou Long-Expected Jesus"
-   "Hail the Day that sees Him Rise"
-   "Hark, The Herald Angels Sing"
-   "Jesu, Lover of My Soul"
-   "Christ the Lord Is Risen Today"
-   "Jesus, The Name High Over All"
-   "Lo! He Comes with Clouds Descending"
-   "Love Divine, All Loves Excelling"
-   "O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing"
-   "Rejoice, the Lord is King"
-   "Soldiers of Christ, Arise"
-   "Ye Servants of God"

As a result of his enduring hymnody, the Gospel Music Association
recognized his musical contributions to the art of gospel music in
1995 by listing his name in the Gospel Music Hall of Fame.
