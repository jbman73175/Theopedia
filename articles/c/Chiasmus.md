**Chiasmus** is a literary structure in which parallel terms or
concepts are first introduced in order and then again in reverse
order to make a point, often emphasizing the middle concept which
either appears twice in succession (ABB'A') or only once (ABCB'A').
It takes its name from the from the Greek letter χ (chi), and is
also called *chiasm* or *chiastic structure*.

## An example

Ephesians 1:12-14

A. to the end that we should be to the praise of his glory,
B. we who had before hoped in Christ:
C. in whom you also, having heard
D. the word of the truth,
D'. the gospel of your salvation,
C'.in whom you also, having believed,
B'. you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, which is an
earnest of our inheritance,
A’. to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of his
glory.
