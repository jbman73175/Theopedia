The **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy** was formulated in
1978 by approximately 300 evangelical scholars at a conference
sponsored by the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy, held
in Chicago. The statement was designed to defend the position of
Biblical [inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy") against trends toward
liberal conceptions of [Scripture](Scripture "Scripture") and
higher biblical criticism. The undersigners came from a variety of
evangelical denominations, and include
[James Montgomery Boice](James_Montgomery_Boice "James Montgomery Boice"),
[Carl F. H. Henry](Carl_F._H._Henry "Carl F. H. Henry"),
[Roger Nicole](Roger_Nicole "Roger Nicole"),
[J. I. Packer](J._I._Packer "J. I. Packer"),
[Francis Schaeffer](Francis_Schaeffer "Francis Schaeffer"), and
[R. C. Sproul](R._C._Sproul "R. C. Sproul").

Leading inerrantists regard the Chicago Statement as a very
thorough statement of what they mean by "inerrancy". The statement
elaborates on various details in Articles formed as couplets of "We
affirm … and We deny …". Also in this Statement, inerrancy applies
only to the *original manuscripts* (which no longer exist, but can
be inferred on the basis of extant copies), not to the copies or
translations themselves. Further, inerrancy does *not* mean blind
literalism, but allows for figurative, poetic and phenomenological
language, as long as it is *accurate*. Nor does the Statement
define the precise set of biblical books to be considered
"Scripture".

## Background

The International Council on Biblical Inerrancy produced three
major statements: one on biblical
[inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy") in 1978, one on biblical
[hermeneutics](Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics") in 1982, and one on
biblical application in 1986. It formally disbanded in 1988.
