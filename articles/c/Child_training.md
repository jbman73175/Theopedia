Q. 129. What is required of superiors towards their inferiors?

A. It is required of superiors, according to that power they
receive from God, and that relation wherein they stand, to love,
pray for, and bless their inferiors; to instruct, counsel, and
admonish them; countenancing, commending, and rewarding such as do
well; and discountenancing, reproving, and chastising such as do
ill; protecting, and providing for them all things necessary for
soul and body: and by grave, wise, holy, and exemplary carriage, to
procure glory to God, honour to themselves, and so to preserve that
authority which God hath put upon them.

Q. 130. What are the sins of superiors?

A. The sins of superiors are, besides the neglect of the duties
required of them, and inordinate seeking of themselves, their own
glory, ease, profit, or pleasure; commanding things unlawful, or
not in the power of inferiors to perform; counseling, encouraging,
or favouring them in that which is evil; dissuading, discouraging,
or discountenancing them in that which is good; correcting them
unduly; careless exposing, or leaving them to wrong, temptation,
and danger; provoking them to wrath; or any way dishonouring
themselves, or lessening their authority, by an unjust, indiscreet,
rigorous, or remiss behaviour.
