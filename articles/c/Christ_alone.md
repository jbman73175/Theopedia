## Relation to the other Solas

1.  [Sola scriptura](Sola_scriptura "Sola scriptura") - Christ's
    life, death and ressurection is chronicled perfectly in the Holy
    Scriptures. Only from Scripture is it possible to derive any
    knowledge of His saving work.
2.  [Sola gratia](Sola_gratia "Sola gratia") - The knowledge of
    Christ's redeeming work is made accessible to man in spite of his
    hardened heart (which views the gospel as "foolishness" - 1 Cor
    2:14)
3.  [Sola fide](Sola_fide "Sola fide") - Grace produces faith,
    which brings actual salvation upon the believing sinner.
4.  [Soli Deo gloria](Soli_Deo_gloria "Soli Deo gloria") - Christ
    is glorified whenever someone believes in His redeeming work. His
    ressurection is often reffered to the glorification of His mission
    on earth.
