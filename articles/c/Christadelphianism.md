"**Christadelphian theology** is another clever impersonation of
Christianity. It denies the devil's existence as a fallen angel, as
well as fiery hell, the Trinity, that Jesus' sacrifice was
substitutionary, and it teaches that Jesus had a sinful nature. It
is definitely not Christian. Read about the Christadelphians here."
-[CARM](http://www.carm.org/christadelphian.htm)

The Christadelphian sect was founded in 1838 by John Thomas, a
London-born physician turned Bible teacher. Like the founders of
the Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses, Mormons and Christian Scientists, Thomas
believed he alone had found the truth of real
Christianity.[[1]](http://www.gotquestions.org/Christadelphianism.html)

Christadelphianism teaches the same two lies as literally every
cult and false religion: they deny the deity of Jesus Christ and
preach a works-based
salvation.[[2]](http://www.gotquestions.org/Christadelphianism.html)
