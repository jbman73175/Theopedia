The term **Christian** simply means "follower of Christ". This has
much to do with who Jesus was, what he did, and what he taught. It
is axiomatic (indeed, built into the very definition of the word)
that without Jesus Christ, after whom this faith is named, one is
not a Christian.

"And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians." (Acts
11:26b)
