The **Christian Counseling and Educational Foundation** (CCEF) was
founded in 1968. Its purpose is to influence biblical counseling
and "teach people how to explore the wisdom and depth of the Bible
and apply its grace-centered message to the problems of daily
living." Simply put, their mission is to: "Restore Christ to
Counseling and Counseling to the Church."

-   Restore Christ to Counseling - personal change is centered in
    the person of Christ. This leads to constantly revisit the
    question, “How do the riches of the Gospel impact lives and efforts
    to help others?” Everything flows from a desire to equip Christians
    to live and love in a Christ-centered way.

-   Restore Counseling to the Church - the church of Christ is
    God’s chosen context for change - it is the community God uses to
    transform his people. CCEF’s mission is to equip the church to be
    this kind of transforming community. They see themselves as an
    extension of the local church, and want to serve and promote its
    ministry.

CCEF's strategy involves a unique synergy of publishing,
counseling, equipping, and academic training - tied with the
passion to equip God’s people to experience Christ amid the
challenges of life.
