The **Christian Heritage Museum** is a privately-owned collection
of over 20,000 biblical artifacts located in Hagerstown, Maryland.
Gene S. Albert, Jr. has been collecting rare Bibles and other
Christian documents since the early 1980s. Many of these artifacts
are now housed in the loft of of his climate-controlled barn, home
of the museum. One of the unique attractions of the museum is the
invitation to touch and purchase the artifacts. Despite being worth
tens of thousands of dollars, "we happen to believe that these were
made and meant to be seen, and that's why we put them out for the
general public," Albert says.^[[1]](#note-0)^

Albert also maintains
[Historical Reproductions](http://historicprints.com) (which
reproduces antique prints) and
[Creative Home Builders](http://creative-homebuilders.com/) (real
estate).
