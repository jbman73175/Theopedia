The **Christian Reformed Church** in North America (CRCNA or CRC)
is a [Protestant](Protestant "Protestant")
[Christian](Christian "Christian")
[denomination](Denomination "Denomination") which is traditionally
[Reformed theology](Reformed "Reformed") in its theology.

This denomination in the United States and Canada has its roots in
the
[Dutch Reformed](index.php?title=Dutch_Reformed&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dutch Reformed (page does not exist)")
churches in the Netherlands. The church was founded by Gijsbert
Haan and Dutch immigrants in the mid 1800s. Its churches are
predominately in areas of heavy Dutch settlement, including western
Michigan, Chicagoland, British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Iowa.
The denomination has about 1,000 congregations located in the
United States and Canada. Many churches, particularly in more urban
areas, are becoming much more integrated. Emerging from its role as
primarily an immigrant church, it has become more outward focused.
They represent the United States and Canada in the Reformed
Ecumenical Council.

## Theology

The denomination's theology is founded in Calvinism and influenced
by the other great reformers, such as
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"). A more recent
theologian of great influence on this church was
[Abraham Kuyper](Abraham_Kuyper "Abraham Kuyper") in the latter
part of the nineteenth century. Kuyper promoted a belief of social
responsibility for Christians to actively engage in improving all
aspects of life and society.

Specifically, the theology of the CRC is traditionally defined by
the so-called *Three forms of Unity*, consisting of:

-   [Heidelberg Catechism](Heidelberg_Catechism "Heidelberg Catechism")
    (1563),
-   [Belgic Confession](Belgic_Confession "Belgic Confession")
    (1566),
-   [Canons of Dort](Canons_of_Dort "Canons of Dort") (1619)

## History

The Christian Reformed Church split from the Reformed Church in
America in a theological dispute that originated in the
Netherlands. Some churches merged with the CRC, most notably the
True Protestant Dutch Reformed Church in 1890. Other churches later
split from the CRC, including the
[Protestant Reformed Church](Protestant_Reformed_Church "Protestant Reformed Church")
(1924) and the United Reformed Churches in North America (1990s).

In the closing decades of the twentieth century, the CRC exhibited
growing numbers of characteristics that were troubling to the more
conservative members of its constituency, especially its 1995
decision to ordain women to ministerial positions. As a result of
this decision, the
[Presbyterian Church in America](Presbyterian_Church_in_America "Presbyterian Church in America")
and the
[Orthodox Presbyterian Church](Orthodox_Presbyterian_Church "Orthodox Presbyterian Church")
broke fraternal relations with the CRC in 1997. The membership of
the CRC in the North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council,
the single largest gathering of conservative Reformed denominations
in the United States, was suspended in 1999 and terminated in 2001.
This gradual doctrinal shift has spurred more conservative
congregations to leave, and a significant number of these have
ended up in either the PCA, OPC, or the United Reformed Church
mentioned
above.^[***[citations\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

The Christian Reformed Church belongs to the Reformed Ecumenical
Council and the National Association of Evangelicals.

## Calvin College and Seminary

The denomination runs Calvin College as well as Calvin Theological
Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the denomination's North
American headquarters are located. Other colleges associated with
the denomination are Trinity Christian College, Dordt College,
Reformed Bible College, Redeemer University College, The King's
University College, and the post-graduate Institute for Christian
Studies.
