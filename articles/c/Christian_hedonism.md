"[John Piper](John_Piper "John Piper")'s writings have made a large
impact on Reformed and other evangelical believers in the late
twentieth century, and their influence continues unabated. Building
on some ideas of Jonathan Edwards, Piper argues that the Christian
life is essentially an enjoyment of God, for God is glorified when
his people enjoy him. The Christian life gets out of kilter when we
find ourselves enjoying other things in the place of God. Piper's
work has generated a renewal movement similar to that of Sonship,
though with a somewhat different message." -

## Criticisms

"Piper has been criticized for failing to recognize the theme of
the
[Heidelberg Catechism](Heidelberg_Catechism "Heidelberg Catechism"):
that our obedience to God is motivated by gratitude for what he has
done for us. He has replied that he is not opposed to obedience
motivated by gratitude. He rather opposes the 'debtor's ethic', the
notion that we must somehow seek to pay God back for what he has
done for us."
