## Fruit of the Spirit

The fruit of the Spirit are fruits that come from those who have
received the Spirit "by hearing with faith" (Galatians 3:2)

"But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the
desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the
Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for
these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things
you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under
the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality,
impurity, sensuality, [idolatry](Idolatry "Idolatry"), sorcery,
enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions,
divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn
you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not
inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is

against such things there is no law. And those who belong to Christ
Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."
-Galatians 5:16-24

## Living by the Word

The word of God plays a central role in the life of a believer.
Jesus prayed, "Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth."
(John 17:17) James wrote that we should "put away all filthiness
and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted
word, which is able to save your souls." (James 1:21) David wrote
that the one who delights in the law (referring to the word of
God), the one who meditates on it day and night and does not walk
in the counsel of the wicked--"He is like a tree planted by streams
of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not
wither. In all that he does, he prospers." (Psalm 1:3)

## The Law

Controversy exists about what law, if any is applicable and
obligatory towards Christians. Since Paul wrote Galatians,
Christians have understood that the outward sign of circumcision is
not required for salvation. Some believe that the law can be
divided into moral, ceremonial, and civil categories. Many go on to
say that the moral law within the larger books of the law is
eternally binding upon Christians.

> For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an
> iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.
> Matthew 5:18

Others claim any categorical divisions are irrelevant in the
discussion of which law should be obeyed, and would even suggest
the Ten Commandments are not binding on Christians. These people
often argue based on Paul's writing in the book of Galatians.

> if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Galatians
> 5:18

The dispute is perhaps most evident in practices surrounding the
Sabbath. Some Christians maintain that it's important that the
Sabbath is respected as a day of rest and worship. Others insist
that while the "Sabbath principle" of setting time aside for
worship and rest is important for Christians, Christians are not
bound to practice the principle on Sunday or even on any specific
day of the week.

## The way of the cross

Paul said that "that through many tribulations we must enter the
kingdom of God." (Acts 14:22) Jesus taught, "Whoever loves his life
loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for
eternal life. If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I
am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father
will honor him." (John 12:25-26) "If anyone would come after me,
let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me."
(Luke 9:23) John wrote, "By this we may be sure that we are in him:
whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in
which he walked." (1 John 2:5-6) "Christ also suffered for you,
leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps." (1
Peter 2:21, cf; 1 Peter 2:18-25)

## Prayer

God loves to give, and he loves those who cast themselves on him in
dependence. This is primarily expressed through prayer. It honors
the Father, it expresses love, and it provides a way for us to
glorify Christ as the great sympathizer.

*See main article: [Prayer](Prayer "Prayer")*
## Worship

Worship is the giving of praise to God for the aspects of His
character and things He has done. Paul wrote to the Romans,
"present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to
God, which is your spiritual worship." (Romans 12:1)
