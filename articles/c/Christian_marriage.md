[Christians](Christian "Christian") typically regard
[marriage](Marriage "Marriage") as instituted and ordained by God
for the lifelong relationship between one man as husband and one as
wife. Marriage is a legally and socially sanctioned union that is
regulated by laws, rules, customs, beliefs, and attitudes that
prescribe the rights and duties of the partners and accords status
to their offspring (if any).^[[1]](#note-EB)^ While Christian
theology affirms the secular status of marriage, it additionally
views it from a moral and religious perspective that transcends all
social interests.

> Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed
> be undefiled; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous.

> {{\#if:Hebrews 13:4|

Marriage is honored among Christians and throughout the Bible.
However, the Bible does not make it necessary for everyone. Those
who have chosen to remain single or who once married but have lost
their spouse for some reason are neither incomplete in Christ nor
personal failures. There is no suggestion that
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") was ever married.

## Marriage license

In most societies, a marriage license or other legal document must
be obtained from a government agency to legalize the marriage.
Every state in the U.S. requires a license to legalize a marriage.
Specific requirements vary from state to state. Obtaining a
marriage license is the responsibility of the bride and groom.
Usually, both parties about to marry need to sign the application
in person. Following the ceremony, both spouses and the Officiant
sign the marriage license and some states require the signature of
a witness. The Officiant then files for a certified copy of the
marriage license, which is usually called the
*marriage certificate.* The married couple should purchase a
certified copy of their marriage certificate to use as legal proof
of marriage and name change.^[[2]](#note-0)^

## Purposes

Essentially all [Protestant](Protestantism "Protestantism")
denominations hold that marriage is ordained by God for the union
between a man and a woman. They see the primary purpose of this
union to be to glorify^[[3]](#note-1)^ God by demonstrating his
love to the world. Other purposes of marriage include intimate
companionship, rearing children and mutual support for both husband
and wife to fulfill their life callings. Protestants generally
approve of
[birth control](index.php?title=Birth_control&action=edit&redlink=1 "Birth control (page does not exist)")
and consider marital sexual pleasure to be a gift of God. While
condoning [divorce](Divorce "Divorce") only under limited
circumstances, most Protestant churches allow for divorce and
remarriage.^[[4]](#note-2)^

In their book
*Two Becoming One: Experiencing the Power of Oneness in Your Marriage,*^[[5]](#note-3)^
Don and Sally Meredith cite three mandates that God gives for
Christian marriage: to reflect, reign, and reproduce. They say
these purposes are so important that Satan works hard to keep
Christians from accomplishing them.

-   Reflect God’s Image. "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our
    image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea
    and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth,
    and over all the creatures that move along the ground'. So, God
    created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him;
    male and female he created
    them.”^[[Gen. 1:26-27](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Gen.%201:26-27;&version=TNIV;)]^
    The Merediths find the words “image” and “likeness" significant,
    understanding them to indicate that God creates “them” as a unit to
    reflect Him. It takes both a man and woman, in oneness, to truly
    reflect His image. Spousal relational stress--lack of
    oneness--actually is dishonoring to God.
-   Reproduce Children in God’s Likeness. "God blessed them and
    said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth
    and subdue
    it.' ”^[[Gen. 1:28a](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Gen.%201:28a;&version=TNIV;)]^
    Married couples who are able to bear children should prayerfully
    consider the call to reproduce children – in His “likeness.” The
    Merediths write that couples who are competitive, angry and divided
    are not fully able to nurture children in God’s image. To teach
    children the principles of *agape* love, godly discipline, and good
    morals, parents must first model those principles. Words are not
    enough! As parents puts aside their innate selfishness and trust
    God to meet their needs, petty disagreements fade in comparison to
    their love for their children. The Christian couple who does not
    have children can fulfill this purpose by making others disciples
    of Jesus Christ.
-   Reign together. "God blessed them and said to them, 'Be
    fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue
    it.'”^[[Gen. 1:28a](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Gen.%201:28a;&version=TNIV;)]^
    We are to be stewards of the physical resources entrusted to us and
    we must do our share in the spiritual realm. A spiritual battle
    goes on in every heart. Only as couples come together in unity and
    oneness will the enemy of our souls be defeated. Just as the
    Godhead represents perfect unity and is a force for God’s will in
    His universe, the Christian couple is to pray and discern God’s
    will in all situations.

## Roles and responsibilities in marriage

Roles and responsibilities of husband and wives now vary
considerably on a continuum between the long-held male
dominant/female submission view and a growing shift toward equality
(without sameness)^[[6]](#note-4)^ of the woman and the man. There
is considerable debate among many Christians today whether equality
of husband and wife or male headship is the biblically-ordained
view, and even if it is biblically-permissible. The divergent
opinions fall into two main groups:
[Complementarians](Complementarianism "Complementarianism") (who
call for husband-headship and wife-submission) and
[Christian Egalitarians](index.php?title=Christian_Egalitarianism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Christian Egalitarianism (page does not exist)")
(who believe in full partnership equality in which couples can
discover and negotiate roles and responsibilities in
marriage).^[[7]](#note-5)^

## Divorce

[Divorce](Divorce "Divorce"), the legal dissolution of marriage, is
seen from a Christian perspective as less than God's ideal.
Specific opinions range from it being considered universally wrong
to the reality that it sometimes is inevitable.

### Divorce rates among Christian groups

A 2008 study by the Barna Group found that born-again Christians
*who are not evangelical* are just as likely as the average
American couple to divorce. Slightly more encouraging is the
divorce rate among evangelical Christians – who are defined as
meeting the born-again criteria plus other conditions. It was lower
(26 percent) than the national average (33 percent). Meanwhile,
those associated with a non-Christian faith were more likely to
divorce (38 percent), the study showed. Christians, which includes
evangelicals, the divorce figure is 32 percent, which is
statistically identical to the 33 percent figure among non-born
again adults, the research group noted. The study is based on a
random sample of 5,017 adults.^[[8]](#note-Barrick)^

While a higher proportion of born-again Christians marry (84
percent) compared to the national average (78 percent), recent
trends indicate that Americans are growing more comfortable with
divorce. George Barna, who directed the study, says, "There no
longer seems to be much of a stigma attached to divorce; it is now
seen as an unavoidable rite of passage." Barna adds that
"Interviews with young adults suggest that they want their initial
marriage to last, but are not particularly optimistic about that
possibility." Barna also noted that "There is also evidence that
many young people are moving toward embracing the idea of serial
marriage, in which a person gets married two or three times,
seeking a different partner for each phase of their adult
life."^[[8]](#note-Barrick)^

### Jesus on divorce

In the beginning, God instituted marriage as a permanent
arrangement.^[[Gen 2:24](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Gen%202:24;&version=TNIV;)]^
In
[Matthew 19:6](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Matthew%2019:6;&version=TNIV;)
and
[Mark 10:9](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Mark%2010:9;&version=TNIV;),
Jesus adds what has been called a "divine postscript" to
[Genesis 2:24](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Genesis%202:24;&version=TNIV;):
"So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined
together, let no one separate." However, in
[Matthew 19:9](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Matthew%2019:9;&version=TNIV;),
he puts a qualification on it, "...except for..." and the word he
uses is the Greek word *porneia,* from which the English language
word [pornography](Pornography "Pornography") is derived. It is
sometimes called the "exception clause" to divorce and is also
found in
[Matthew 5:32](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Matthew%205:32;&version=TNIV;).

*Porneia* is often translated as "unfaithfulness." Many have
concluded that if one's spouse commits adultery, the innocent
spouse is free to divorce and remarry.^[[9]](#note-Columbia)^
However, *porneia* has a less precise meaning than *moichao,* the
word for adultery. Thus, there may be good reason to suspect that
"marital unfaithfulness" is not a good translation. The normal or
basic meaning of "porneia" in the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") is
*sexual immorality.*^[[1Cor 5:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=1Cor%205:1;&version=TNIV;)]^
^[[Acts 15:20](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Acts%2015:20;&version=TNIV;)]^

It has been claimed that *porneia* is a matter of the "heart" and
is an evil intention not necessarily entailing an evil or immoral
action of sex with another person. If so, then staying faithful
physically to one person is not a guarantee that sexual sin isn't
taking place. In
[Matthew 5](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?passage=Matthew%205;&version=TNIV;),
Jesus extends the definition of adultery beyond the traditional
legalistic approach. He teaches:

-   Even looking at another married women lustfully constitutes
    adultery.
-   Divorcing one's faithful wife (push her out of the home)
    constitutes adultery and makes her an adulteress.
-   Marrying a divorced woman (having sex with a woman who has left
    her marriage or has been rejected or forced out by her husband)
    constitutes adultery.

However, a man is not sinning if his wife (whom he loves, accepts,
and cares for) commits adultery of her own
volition.^[[10]](#note-6)^

While Reformed, Evangelical points of view usually discourage
divorce, they do not expressly prohibit it in general. Some groups
will not hire (call) as pastor a divorced person. These same groups
are likely to dismiss a pastor who becomes divorced. At the other
extreme, in Catholic theology, marriage is a divine institution
that can never be broken, even if the husband or wife legally
divorce in the civil courts; as long as they are both alive, the
Church considers them bound together by God. However, Catholic
marriage can be annulled ("declaration of nullity or invalidity")
under certain conditions where the church states that a valid
marriage, as the Church defines marriage, never
existed.^[[11]](#note-7)^
