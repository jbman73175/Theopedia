**Christianity** is a term generally referring to that Christian
faith based on the life, death, and
[resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection") of
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") as presented in the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") Scriptures. The word
*Christian* simply means "follower of Christ," first used in the
New Testament in Acts 11:26: "And in Antioch the disciples were
first called *Christians*." Christianity is a
[monotheistic](Monotheism "Monotheism") faith, believing in only
one [God](God "God"). However, based on the teaching of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"), God has been revealed as a
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") of [persons](Person "Person"), not to
be mistaken as a belief in [three gods](Tritheism "Tritheism").

Christianity regards the [Bible](Bible "Bible") (both Old and New
Testaments) as the
[inspired](Inspiration_of_the_Bible "Inspiration of the Bible")
word of God and
[authoritative](Authority_of_the_Bible "Authority of the Bible") in
all matters of faith and practice. Early extra-biblical definitions
of the Christian faith are expressed in the
[Apostles' Creed](Apostles'_Creed "Apostles' Creed") and the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed").

[dramatic increase in its number of adherents](http://users.adam.com.au/bstett/BChristianIncrease12.htm).^[[1]](#note-0)^^[[2]](#note-1)^

[Lausanne Movement](index.php?title=Lausanne_Movement&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lausanne Movement (page does not exist)")
was started in order to help Christendom evangelize globally with
greater effectiveness and thousands of Christian leaders from
around the globe meet regularly to increase the effectiveness of
