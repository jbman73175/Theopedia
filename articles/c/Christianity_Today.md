**Christianity Today** is an
[evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism")
[Christian](Christian "Christian") periodical based in Carol
Stream, Illinois. Readers can keep abreast of matters concerning
books and culture, campus life, Christian history, Christian
parenting, leadership skills, marriage, men and women,
[Bible](Bible "Bible") study, preaching and spiritual help.

Begun in 1956 as a way to bring the evangelical Christian community
together, the magazine was founded by the famous evangelist
[Billy Graham](Billy_Graham "Billy Graham"). Its first editor was
Carl F. H. Henry. Notable contributors in its first two decades
included contributions from
[F. F. Bruce](F._F._Bruce "F. F. Bruce"), Edward John Carnell,
Frank Gaebelein, [Walter Martin](Walter_Martin "Walter Martin"),
John Warwick Montgomery, and Harold Lindsell. Lindsell succeeded
Henry as editor and during his editorial administration much
attention centred on debates about
[biblical inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy"). Later editorial work
came Kenneth Kantzer and Terry Muck. Notable current writers
include author [Philip Yancey](Philip_Yancey "Philip Yancey"),
Fuller Theological Seminary's Richard Mouw, Yale University law
professor Stephen Carter, and Prison Fellowship's Charles W.
Colson.

The magazine's presence on the Internet, originally named
*ChristianityOnline*, began in 1996. Today it and its sister
publications, which range from the popular
(*Today's Christian Woman*) to the intellectual
(*Books & Culture*), reach well over 2 million readers in both
traditional paperbound and Internet forms.

The magazine ran some of the first advertisements for Jerry
Falwell's Moral Majority. Founding editor Henry was an advocate for
the labor movement, and in the past decade the magazine and its
sister publications have run articles both promoting and
criticizing the
[intelligent design](Intelligent_design "Intelligent design")
movement. During presidential campaigns columns give coverage to
both Republican and Democrat candidates, with emphasis on their
moral and social justice agendas.
