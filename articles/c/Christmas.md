**Christmas** is a holiday commemmorating the birth of Jesus,
celebrated on December 25 (some Eastern Orthodox Churches celebrate
on this date according to the Julian calendar, which currently
corresponds to January 7). There is no consensus on exactly how and
when the celebration of Christmas started, but the majority of
scholars agree that the actual birthdate of Jesus remains unknown.
The word is derived from a contraction meaning "Christ's mass".
Aspects of the celebration may include a surge in church
attendance, increased focus on teaching about the incarnation, the
gathering of many families and friends, the exchange of cards and
gifts (often including the Santa Claus myth), and the display of
Nativity sets, Christmas trees, and an abundance of lights and
decorations.

Despite being nearly universally associated with the birth of
Jesus, Christmas is celebrated by a broad range of people of many
different faiths. Largely a cultural holiday developed by writers
like Washington Irving and Charles Dickens in the 19th century as a
family-oriented day of "peace on earth and good will toward men,"
it is also the most economically significant holiday of the year.
This commercialization, along with the relationships some have
tried to draw in recent years to ancient pagan festivals, has
prompted some groups to oppose the celebration of Christmas,
despite the fact that our current traditions bear almost no
resemblance to the practices of the ancient, classical or medieval
periods.

## History

### Pagan origins?

There were a variety of Roman festivals around December that many
point to as early predecessors of the Christmas feast. The festival
honoring the god of agriculture (Saturn) was celebrated on December
17 during the Republic Era and transformed over the years from a
day of merry-making to a full week or more of decadent revelry
during the late Empire Era. Most cultures in the Mediterranean had
festivals celebrating the winter solstice (which on the Julian
calendar being used at the time fell on December 25), and the
Romans were no exception. In A.D. 274 the Feast of Sol Invictus
(Invincible Sun) was established to mark the shortest day of the
year. A week later the Romans would celebrate the first new moon of
the new year.

Little is known about how (or whether) these festivals impacted the
earliest celebration of the birth of Jesus. During his life,
celebration of one's birthday was indeed more of a pagan practice
than a religious one (cf. Mark 6:21-29). There is no record of the
apostles or the early church leaders doing anything significant to
mark the day of Jesus' birth. In fact, the earliest record of
December 25 as a church festival was after the last great
persecution (the document dates to AD 354, but refers to a Roman
practice in AD
336).^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
While there is no historical evidence that anyone in the
pre-reformation era made the connection between Saturnalia, Sol
Invicta or any Roman feast and the Christian celebration of
Christmas, modern scholars point to the coincidence of the dates to
demonstrate that they must be related. The first recorded
observation of this alleged link was in 1687 by Increase Mather, a
[Puritan](Puritan "Puritan") preacher (and father of
[Cotton](Cotton_Mather "Cotton Mather")).^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

For one and a half millennia, the religious significance of this
festival was minimal at best. From the 5th to the 16th centuries,
the Roman Catholic Church celebrated the "Feast of Fools," which
mimicked the practices of Saturnalia, but no one ever tried to
associate this with Christmas. In the early 7th century, the pope
ordered that churches be decorated for the feast. The tradition of
Christmas trees may have developed subsequent to this. In the
colonial times, celebration of Christmas was actually banned.
However, the state of Alabama declared Christmas a legal holiday in
1836, and its popularity has spread ever since.

On the other hand, it appears that most of the traditions and
practices of the various pagan festivals around the winter solstice
have run their course. While the vestiges of human sacrifices may
be found in the baking of gingerbread men, or perhaps the remnants
of orgies found in the expectation of a kiss under the mistletoe,
it would be hard to argue that our modern celebrations rival the
debauchery of Mardi Gras (which ironically stems from a religious
holiday.)

### Traditional dates for the birth of Christ

In the latter half of the second century AD,
[Clement of Alexandria](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book1.html)
was among the earliest to affix a date to Jesus' birth:
> "From the birth of Christ, therefore, to the death of Commodus are,
> in all, a hundred and ninety-four years, one month, thirteen days."

Using the Roman calendar, the date would be November 19, 3 BC
However, being from Egypt, it is not unreasonable to assume Clement
would count using the Egyptian calendar, making it January 6, 2 BC.
For several reasons, this date quickly became the most popular
theory, although several others are mentioned, including March 25
or April 6.
Apparently there was a widespread belief in Judaism at the time of
Christ that the prophets of Israel died on the same dates as their
birth or conception. While some held to the March 25 or April 6
crucifixion date as his birth date, it was more commonly held that
this was the date of his Incarnation. Thus, his birthday would
naturally follow nine months later, landing on December 25 or
January 6, depending on which calendar you used. (The reason for
the discrepancy arose from the difference between how the Greek
Christians in the eastern part of the empire and the Latin
Christians in the western part of it calculated the date of
Christ's crucifixion.)

In his early third century commentary on Daniel,
[Hippolytus](http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/hippolytus-exegetical.html),
Bishop of Rome, wrote (according to some manuscripts):
> "The first coming of our Lord, that in the flesh, in which he was
> born at Bethlehem, took place eight days before the Kalends of
> January, a Wednesday, in the forty-second year of the reign of
> Augustus, 5500 years from Adam."

Writing as he was from a Jewish-Christian perspective, this would
be interpreted as December 25, 2 BC. However, many believe that
this date is contradicted in the same manuscript where he
calculates it as April 2. Therefore, it is surmised that he amended
his date to conform to the more popular traditional date held by
his contemporaries.
It should be noted that despite these ancient (well before the
establishment of pagan festivities around the winter solstice by
Aurelian in AD 274) attempts to calculate the actual date of Jesus’
birthday, there was very little interest in celebrating it as a
holiday in the early church or even in the post-reformation
evangelical church until at least the 19th century.

### Biblical dates for the birth of Christ

-   (Luke 1) Herod was king in Judea. According to
    [Antiquities of the Jews (XVII:6:4)](http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-17.htm)
    by Josephus, there was a lunar eclipse just a few days before he
    died, likely corresponding to the
    [astronomical event](http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/LEcat/LE-0099-0000.html)
    in either 5 or 1 BC The latter date roughly matches other
    milestones listed by Josephus, such as the 37-year reign (from
    around 39 BC) and the 34 years elapsed since the conquest of
    Jerusalem (around 36 BC) In any case, we can reasonably assume that
    the conception and birth of both John the Baptist and Jesus
    occurred at least a few years before 1 BC (cf. Matthew 2:16,
    "...according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise
    men.")
-   (Luke 1) Zechariah's division (Abijah) was on duty in the
    temple. This position in the rotation would place the conception of
    John the Baptist sometime shortly after the middle of the 3rd
    (Sivan) month of the Jewish calendar (cf. I Chronicles 24:10).
-   (Luke 1) Mary conceived Jesus around the 6th month of
    Elizabeth's pregnancy, or somewhere around the 9th (Kislev) Jewish
    month. Assuming a normal period of human gestation, Jesus would
    have been born somewhere around the 6th (Elul) or 7th (Tishri)
    month, near the appointed time for the feast of Tabernacles (cf.
    Leviticus 23:33-43).
-   (Luke 2) Augustus was the Roman Emperor and Quirinius was
    ostensibly governing Syria. While Caesar Augustus' reign places the
    period comfortably between 23 BC and AD 14, the presence of
    Quirinius as governor puts the chronology in somewhat of a pickle.
    Most historians agree that he assumed power in AD 6 (several years
    after the death of Herod) and ordered a census for the purpose of
    taxation. In fact, Luke mentions the problems caused by this in his
    second book (cf. Acts 5:37). The key here seems to be that it was
    the "first registration" to take place while he was governing,
    hinting that there would be a subsequent census. Geisler suggests,
    "When it came time to begin the census, in about 8 or 7 BC,
    Augustus entrusted Quirinius with the delicate problem in the
    volatile area of Palestine, effectively superseding the authority
    and governorship of Varus by appointing Quirinius to a place of
    special authority in this matter"^[[1]](#note-0)^
-   (Luke 2) There was no room in the inn. Why? Was it because of
    the census? That's certainly a possibility. However, the census
    process took several years, and unless Joseph and Mary
    procrastinated until the last possible date to go and register
    (which seems unlikely due to the impending birth) it is more
    plausible that they decided to time the journey to coincide with
    their required trip to Jerusalem for one of the three annual
    feasts. This could explain why the accommodations in Bethlehem
    (just a few miles away from Jerusalem) were scarce.
-   (Luke 2) There were shepherds in the field watching their
    flock. This would be unlikely (but possible) during the cold
    winters often experienced in the countryside surrounding Bethlehem.
    However, it would have been a common practice from April through
    September.
-   (Luke 2) They went to the temple in Jerusalem 40 days after the
    birth of Jesus. Luke mentions that it was "according to the Law" on
    three separate occasions and specifically lists the sacrifice they
    made. An odd rendering indicates that it was for their
    purification, rather than just for hers, as would have been
    required by law (cf Leviticus 12).
-   (Luke 2) The theme of *Redemption* was on the mind of both
    Simeon the priest and Anna the old woman. (Interestingly, Luke
    indicates that she had been in the temple both day and night, and
    the temple was usually closed at sundown... except for on Yom
    Kippur.)
