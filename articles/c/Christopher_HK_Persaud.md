## Background & Apologetic Calling

Christopher H.K. Persaud is a Christian apologist, writer and poet.
Vocationally, he is a financial services professional and has
served in such a capacity for over thirty years - previously in
Guyana, South America, where he was born, and more recently in the
USA.

Persaud's writings revolve, in the main, around Bible Prophecy and
Origins theory. His 2007 book, Evolution:
*Beyond the Realm of Real Science*, was voted the grand prize
winner in the 2008 Christian Choice Book Awards contest, a
nationwide venture in its inaugural year and that attracted over
400 entries. *Evolution: Beyond the Realm of Real Science* was
named the 2008 Christian Choice Book of the Year. It also won first
prize in the contest's *Current Event/Issues* category.
Christopher's accomplishment was noted on the Internet and in
newspapers around the country. He was interviewed on radio and his
book was advertised on more than 100 radio stations nationwide.

Persaud's 2010 book,
*The Da Vinci Code Revisited: A Conclusive Refutation of the Widespread, Sinister Lie*,
won first prize in the *Theology* category of the 2010 Christian
Choice Book Awards contest. It was the author's second national
book award and like the previous win, it was advertised widely on
the Internet and in newspapers around the country.
