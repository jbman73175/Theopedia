Christopher Ness
**Christopher Ness** (1621-1705) was an English
[Nonconformist](Nonconformist "Nonconformist") preacher and
author.

Ness entered St. John's College, Cambridge in 1638 where he
graduated B.A. and M.A. At age 23 he moved to Yorkshire where he
became a preacher of independent tenets successively at South
Cliffe Chapel in his native parish, in Holderness, and at Beverley,
where he taught a school.

In 1656, he became a preacher at Leeds, and in 1660 he was a
lecturer under the vicar, Dr. Lake, afterwards Bishop of
Chichester; but his [Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") clashed with
the [Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism") of Dr. Lake, and on
St. Bartholomew's day in 1662 he was ejected from his lectureship.
After this he became a schoolmaster and private preacher at
Clayton, Morley, and Hunslet, all in Yorkshire. At Hunslet he took
an indulgence as a Congregationalist in 1672, and a new
meeting-house was opened by him on June 3, 1672.

He was excommunicated no less than four times, and when in 1674 or
1675 a writ *de excommunicato capiendo* was issued against him, he
moved to London, where he preached to a private congregation in
Salisbury Court, Fleet Street. In 1684 he had to conceal himself
from the officers of the crown, who had a warrant for his arrest on
the charge of publishing an elegy on the death of his friend John
Partridge, another Nonconformist minister. He died on December 26,
1705, aged exactly 84 years, and was buried at Bunhill Fields
Cemetery.
