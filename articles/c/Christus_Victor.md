**Christus Victor** (Christ the Victor) is a view of the
[atonement](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ") taken from
the title of [Gustaf Aulén](Gustaf_Aulén "Gustaf Aulén")'s
groundbreaking book, first published in 1931, where he drew
attention back to the early church's *Ransom* theory. In Christus
Victor, the atonement is viewed as divine conflict and victory over
the hostile powers that hold humanity in subjection. Aulén argues
that the classic Ransom theory is not so much a rational systematic
theory as it is a drama, a passion story of [God](God "God")
triumphing over the powers and liberating
[humanity](Humanity "Humanity") from the bondage of
[sin](Sin "Sin"). As Gustav Aulén writes, "the work of Christ is
first and foremost a victory over the powers which hold mankind in
bondage: sin, death, and the devil."^[[1]](#note-0)^

The [Ransom Theory](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ") was
predominant in the early church and for the first thousand years of
church history and supported by all Greek
[Church Fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers") from
[Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") to
[John of Damascus](John_of_Damascus "John of Damascus"). To mention
only the most important names [Origen](Origen "Origen"),
[Athanasius](Athanasius "Athanasius"),
[Basil the Great](Basil_the_Great "Basil the Great"),
[Gregory of Nyssa](Gregory_of_Nyssa "Gregory of Nyssa"),
[Gregory of Nazianzus](Gregory_of_Nazianzus "Gregory of Nazianzus"),
and [John Chrysostom](John_Chrysostom "John Chrysostom"). The
Christus Victor view was also dominant among the Latin Fathers of
the Patristic period including [Ambrose](Ambrose "Ambrose"),
[Augustine](Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo"),
[Leo the Great](Leo_the_Great "Leo the Great"), and
[Gregory the Great](Gregory_the_Great "Gregory the Great").

A major shift occurred when
[Anselm of Canterbury](Anselm_of_Canterbury "Anselm of Canterbury")
published his *Cur Deos Homo* around 1097 AD which marks the point
where the predominate understanding of the atonement shifted from
the ransom theory to the
[Satisfaction Doctrine](Satisfaction_theory_of_the_atonement "Satisfaction theory of the atonement")
in the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
and subsequently the
[Protestant Church](Protestantism "Protestantism"). The
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox") Church
still holds to the Ransom or Christus Victor view. This is built
upon the understanding of the atonement put forward by Irenaeus,
called "recapitulation".^[[2]](#note-1)^

As the term *Christus Victor* indicates, the idea of “ransom”
should not be seen in terms (as Anselm did) of a business
transaction, but more of a rescue or liberation of humanity from
the slavery of sin. Unlike the Satisfaction or Penal-substitution
views of the atonement rooted in the idea of Christ paying the
penalty of sin to satisfy the demands of justice, the Christus
Victor view is rooted in the incarnation and how Christ entered
into human misery and wickedness and thus redeemed it.
[Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") called this "Recapitulation"
(re-creation). As it is often expressed: "Jesus became what we are
so that we could become what he is".
