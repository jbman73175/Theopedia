The study of the **Church** is also known as **ecclesiology**. In
general, ecclesiology addresses various issues, the most basic
being a biblical definition of the "church" and its functions.
Other issues involved in ecclesiology include forms of church
government, leadership offices, ordinances, worship, and the
relationship between the New Testament church and Israel, the Old
Testament people of God. Therefore, a clear and biblical
understanding is important to both Christian belief and practice.

## Defining "church"

Various problems have arisen as a result of the multiple usages of
the term *church*. It is sometimes used to describe a building or
some other structure. At other times it refers a specific group of
believers who, for example, attend Christian Reformed Church on 1st
Street. Now and then it is also used to refer to a denomination
such as Presbyterians, or Baptists.

The word *ecclesiology* comes from the [Greek](Greek "Greek")
*ekklesia* meaning *assembly*. While the term today is closely tied
to the Christian church, its roots are broader. It is a compound of
the Greek preposition *ek* (out from) and the verb *kaleo* (to
call). The most generic definition given by
*Thayer's Greek Lexicon* is "a gathering of citizens *called out*
from their homes into some public place." This generic sense of the
word is used several times in one passage of the New Testament
(Acts 19:32, 39 & 41) in reference not to the church but to a group
of Ephesian craftsmen speaking out against the Apostle Paul and his
companions.

The [Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint") used *ekklesia* to
translate the [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew") word *qâhâl*, meaning a
congregation, assembly, company or other organized body
(*Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew Definitions*). These
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") uses of *ekklesia*
are not regarded as referring to the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") church. For example,
the word *church* does not appear in the
[King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version") of
the Old Testament.

*Ekklesia* is found most often in the writings of
[Paul](Paul "Paul").
[Millard Erickson](Millard_Erickson "Millard Erickson") states that
"the term usually has reference to a group of believers in a
specific city. Thus we find Paul's letters addressed the 'the churh
of God in Corinth' (1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 1:1), 'the churches in
Galatia" (Gal. 1:2), 'the church of the Thessalonians' (1 Thess.
1:1)," (*Christian Theology*, p. 1042-43). The NT picture of the
church is also universal. That is, there is one body (Eph 4:4) and
there are times when *church* is used to speak of the *entire*
church (cf. 1 Cor 10:32, 11:22, 12:28; Eph 5:23; Col 1:18, 24).
Thus, the church is "the whole body of those who through Christ's
death have been savingly reconciled to God and have received new
life... while universal in nature, it finds expressions in local
groupings of believers that display the same qualities as does the
body of Christ as a whole," (Erickson, p. 1044).
