## Process / Steps

Church discipline consist of a series of every widening circles as
described in the
[links](Church_discipline#External_links "Church discipline")
section below. To use Dan Frederick's scheme
[[3]](http://setup.finalweb.net/home/140001498/140001500/mar-apr99.pdf)

THE PROCESS In consideration of delineating the process of
corrective care, there are a number of ways to outline the
progressive steps. For this article I offer the following format,
suggesting that four levels may be established. It must be
emphasized once again that the goal is not punishment, but
restoration to fellowship with the Lord and with the fellowship of
believers.

The **Personal Level** It is first of all PERSONAL. As the result
of any real offense by one person to another, a personal addressing
of the issue is required. A one-on-one communication of concern
which, 1) reveals the nature of the offense, and 2) does so with
the purpose of reconciliation and restoration of the relationship.
At this personal level the issue need not become known apart from
the persons directly affected. The issue is dealt with biblically
and the relationship is restored.

The **Private Level** If, however, there is not a positive response
of confession, forgiveness and restoration, it becomes necessary to
take the matter to a second level, involving one or two additional
people, in an arranged, yet still PRIVATE manner. The matter
remains restricted to a select few, again with the goal of
reconciliation and restoration.

The **Public Level** Should all attempts at the first and second
levels fail, which includes an unspecified length of time and an
unspecified number of attempts, it eventually becomes necessary to
make the matter known to the wider fellowship of believers at a
PUBLIC level. Again, the purpose is to achieve humble repentance
for the reconciliation and restoration of all concerned.

The "Putting Out" Level As the last step, the regretful final
course of action, the erring person, or persons, may need to be put
out of the fellowship, commensurate with the displayed disregard
for biblical correction, and treated as an unbeliever. Again, this
is for the purpose of correcting a disobedient believer and seeking
repentance, reconciliation and restoration, while preserving and
protecting the purity of Christ's Bride and Body.

This pattern, or process, is clearly reiterated in the epistles in
such passages as 1 Corinthians 5:1-13; 2 Corinthians 2:5-11; 2
Thessalonians 3:6-15; Titus 1:10-14. These passages reveal the
elements of the corrective care process, including

1.  a motivation of concern for the purity of the body in doctrine
    and personal living,
2.  a careful and principled response to the discovery of error in
    the body,
3.  specific efforts made to correct the error (over a reasonable
    time span by necessary witnesses),
4.  the restoration to fellowship of believers who repent upon
    spiritual admonition and instruction, or
5.  separation of fellowship from the erring believer until
    repentance is achieved and restoration becomes possible.

## Scope of Authority

Until the last generation essentially every church has agreed on
the basics of scope of authority (that is jurisdiction):

-   Church courts could only discipline members
-   A person could not be considered a member of a church for
    purposes of discipline if they did not believe themselves to be a
    member ^[[1]](#note-0)^
-   A renunciation of baptism (that is asserting you were not
    baptized into the church) immediately ended the trial. Trying
    people who had renounced baptism was a sin so serious it led to
    automatic excommunication.
    ^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
    ^[[2]](#note-1)^

*For full membership in the Church, besides valid baptism, one must by union of faith and allegiance be in fellowship with her, and not be deprived of the rights of membership by ecclesiastical censure. Hence, those validly baptized Christians who live in schism or, whether by reason of apostasy or of initial education, profess a faith different from that of the Church, or are excommunicated therefrom, are not members of the Church, though as a matter of objective right and duty they are still her subjects. In practice the Church, while retaining her right over all subjects, does not--except in some few matters not of moment here--insist upon exercising her jurisdiction over any but her members, as it is clear that she cannot expect obedience from those Christians who, being in faith or government separated from her, see no right in her to command, and consequently recognize no duty to obey. Over those who are not baptized she claims no right to govern,*
^[[3]](#note-2)^

  
Once church courts no longer had a close connection with the state
(church sanctions are not physical) ^[[4]](#note-3)^ the issue
became more profound. Yet every Christian writer held to the same
position, a person who does not declare themselves a member could
be considered an apostate but not tried for any other sin.

Changing churches for any reason was frowned upon , as Calvin put
it
^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^:
*The Lord esteems the communion of his Church so highly that he counts as traitor and apostate from Christianity anyone who arrogantly leaves any Christian society, provided it cherishes the true ministry of the Word and sacraments*

Thornwell gives the standard reformed position:

*Every man has a right to withdraw from the Church whenever he pleases, in the sense explained in our former article -- a right in the sense that no human authority has the right to detain him. As before God, he has no more right to apostatize than to commit any other sin. He is bound to believe and keep the commandments. But men have no commission to force him to do either. If he wants to go, they must let him go. "They went out from us," says the Apostle -- not that they were expelled, but they went out of their own accord, freely, voluntarily -- "because they were not of us." They found themselves in the wrong place, and they left it.*
^[[5]](#note-4)^
  
Dabney disagreed arguing that
*the session should do judicially, on the ground of his own avowal, what he had requested, except that they should debar him from the Lord's table until repentance, instead of giving him license to neglect it.*
Adding further:

*Are not avowed impenitence and unbelief incompatible with Christian character, and does not their tolerance in communicants "bring disgrace or scandal" on the Romish and other communions, which formally allow it, in the eyes of all enlightened men? They are, then, a disciplinable offence. But hear Paul (1 Cor 16:22), "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha." Here we have the very formulary of excommunication pronounced, and it is against the man who "loves not the Lord Jesus Christ;" that is, just the man who, in modern phrase, avows himself as "lacking in the suitable qualifications for the Lord's supper."*
*The church, we hold, is solemnly bound to teach the same doctrine in her discipline which she preaches from her pulpits, otherwise she is an unscriptural church. She is bound to testify by her acts as well as her words, against the destructive and wicked delusion so prevalent in consequence of the wresting of the doctrines of grace, that because grace is sovereign, therefore, the failure to exercise gracious principles is rather man's misfortune than his fault. It is this dire delusion which hides from men the sinfulness of their hearts; it hath slain its ten thousands. With what consistency can the pulpit proclaim that unbelief is sin, and then send forth the same pastor into the session room to declare to the misguided transgressor, in the tenfold more impressive language of official acts, that it involves no censure, and that its bold avowal is rather creditable than blameworthy? Shall not the blood of souls be found on such a session?*
^[[6]](#note-5)^
Across the political and religious spectrum within the United
States there has been almost universal concurrence on the idea that
church authority extends only to members. Almost 100 years ago the
very conservative Southern Baptist convention declared that they
aimed not just for toleration for differences in conscience but
that this was a fundamental right:

*Baptists have one consistent record concerning liberty throughout all their long and eventful history. They have never been a party to oppression of conscience. They have forever been the unwavering champions of liberty, both religious and civil. Their contention now, is, and has been, and, please God, must ever be, that it is the natural and fundamental and indefeasible right of every human being to worship God or not, according to the dictates of his conscience, and, as long as he does not infringe upon the rights of others, he is to be held accountable alone to God for all religious beliefs and practices. Our contention is not for mere toleration, but for absolute liberty. There is a wide difference between toleration and liberty. Toleration implies that somebody falsely claims the right to tolerate. Toleration is a concession, while liberty is a right. Toleration is a matter of expediency, while liberty is a matter of principle. Toleration is a gift from God. It is the consistent and insistent contention of our Baptist people, always and everywhere, that religion must be forever voluntary and uncoerced, and that it is not the prerogative of any power, whether civil or ecclesiastical, to compel men to conform to any religious creed or form of worship, or to pay taxes for the support of a religious organization to which they do not believe. God wants free worshipers and no other kind.*^[[7]](#note-6)^
This notion has been enshrined in international law, and thus
extended outside of a Christian framework,
*Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.*
^[[8]](#note-7)^

## Recognition

A question confronting many churches is their duty to recognize the
excommunication of another church. Christian literature has
traditionally held that refusing to recognize the discipline of
another church is to refuse to recognize that church's legitimacy.
An excommunication can only be lifted by those who impose it or by
a recognized higher authority. Aquinas for example addresses
specifically the case of a person who is excommunicated for
something they objectively did not do and still holds that everyone
is bound to recognize the excommunication until it is licitly
lifted (including the person excommunicated). ^[[9]](#note-8)^

In practice excommunication seems to be subdenominational in
effect. In the broader community Churches that recognize one
another's discipline are referred to as **Sister Churches**

*However, there is a growing and prevailing tendency toward disrespect among the Lord’s churches for the disciplinary authority of sister churches. The autonomy and independence of the local church should never be infringed upon by any external power, and we need to remember that church independence does not include the right for a church to ignore the disciplinary authority of churches of like faith and order....It is possible for a church to err in its practice of excessive discipline, but it is not likely. Moreover, no sister church is better qualified to judge in the matter than the church that administered the discipline.*^[[10]](#note-9)^
Reformed church's that recognize one another's authority in this
matter are said to have **Fraternal Relations** (in particular the
[North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council (NAPARC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Presbyterian_and_Reformed_Council "w:North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council")).

However some US Baptist disagree and argue that an excommunication
as no supernatural effect,
*Pertaining only to matters upon earth. The church cannot open and close the doors of heaven at will. Only Christ "openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth" (Rev. 3:7)*
and more directly that
*Pertaining only to matters within a given church; i.e., there can be no inter-church discipline.*
^[[11]](#note-10)^

## Legal Issues

Another very serious question confronting churches is their legal
duty to protect the privacy of its members and to refrain from
interfering with the privacy of non-members. Both state and federal
courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have addressed
the question of church discipline in the context of tort
liability.

One tort often alleged by a disciplined party is defamation.
Defamation involves the intentional "publication" of a false fact
to persons other than the plaintiff. "Publication" is a legal term
that can include dissemination of a fact by any means. Truth is an
absolute defense to allegations or defamation, so a true statement
will never give rise to liability. However, if the statement
asserts a spritual or doctrinal point that is not clearly "true" or
"false", the court is essentially being asked to determine the
truth or falsehood of a religious belief. For this reason, courts
routinely refuse to hear such cases citing the protections and
prohibitions in the First Amendment. However, some courts have
agreed to decide defamation cases involving churches based on
technicalities of tort law.

Another tort often alleged is invasion of privacy. This legal
theory requires the plaintiff to prove that the church disclosed
personal and private facts to others in a manner that a reasonable
person would find highly offensive. This cause of action, where
available, exposes the church to potential liability especially
when church discipline involves matters of sexual behavior such as
fornication, adultery and homosexuality.

The key constitutional principle affecting church discipline was
announced by the U.S. Supreme Court in *Watson v. Jones*: "All who
unite themselves to such a body [a church] do so with an implied
consent to this government, and are bound to submit to it." The
problem facing many churches in America today, then, is in
determining who has consented to the authority of the church's
governing authorities and who is merely checking the church out
before making so consenting. It is absolutely clear that those who
request and receive "membership" within a religious community have
consented to the governing authority of that community. What is not
so clear is the status of those who regularly participate in the
activities of the religious community without becoming "members".
The Oklahoma Supreme Court has further complicated this issue by
holding in a 1989 case
(*Guinn v. Church of Christ of Collinsville*) that a church may not
carry out church discipline procedures regarding a former member
who has withdrawn his/her membership. This case claims to conform
to the U.S. Supreme Court holding in
*Paul v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society* (1987) which supported
the Jehovah's Witnesses in their practice of "shunning" a former
member that had withdrawn from membership in their religious
community. There is disagreement within the legal community
regarding whether or not the Oklahoma *Guinn* case violates the
holding in the U.S. Supreme Court's *Paul* ruling.

The law pertaining to church discipline, therefore, may be summed
up under the headings of the "right of exit" and the "Power of the
Gate." Any participant in a religious community has the "right of
exit", meaning they may leave the religious community at any time
of their choosing. On the other hand, the religious community holds
the "Power of the Gate", meaning that it may refuse to allow a
person from participating in its activities on the basis of its
sincerely held religious beliefs. *See* The Law of Church and State
in America by Rev. Dean M. Kelly, vol. 1, pp. 153-74 (available
online at www.firstamendmentcenter.org).
