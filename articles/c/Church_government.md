**Church government** (or sometimes **church polity**) is that
branch of [ecclesiology](Ecclesiology "Ecclesiology") (study of the
church) that addresses the organizational structure and hierarchy
of the church. There are basically three types of church government
that have developed in the various Christian denominations: the
episcopal, the presbyterian, and the congregational.

## Episcopal

*See main page: [Episcopal (polity)](Episcopal_(polity) "Episcopal (polity)")*
*The polity of the [Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox"), [Coptic](index.php?title=Coptic&action=edit&redlink=1 "Coptic (page does not exist)"), [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic"), [Anglican](Anglican "Anglican"), [Methodist](Methodist "Methodist"), and (some) [Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran") Churches.*

The
[episcopal](index.php?title=Episcopal&action=edit&redlink=1 "Episcopal (page does not exist)")
form of government has been the polity of the Church
[catholic](Catholic "Catholic") as early as
[Ignatius of Antioch](Ignatius_of_Antioch "Ignatius of Antioch"),
all the way down to the time of the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation"). Advocates for an
episcopal form of church government argue that the sheer fact that
it went virtually uncontested until the time of the Reformation
testifies to its claims of
[apostolicity](index.php?title=Apostolicity&action=edit&redlink=1 "Apostolicity (page does not exist)"),
although not all contemporary episcopalian apologists argue from
history rather than Scripture. A notable example is Ray Sutton, the
Suffragan Bishop in the Diocese of Mid-America of the Reformed
Episcopal Church, who has produced work arguing that the episcopal
system is biblical.

## Presbyterian

Common in [Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") and
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") churches, this form of church
government is commonly described as "Elder-run" or
"Presbyter-run".

Typically, original authority--that is the authority that the
church believes Christ gave to it--is said to reside at the local
elder level in this model of polity. Thus the "highest" authority
in a presbyterian or reformed church (after Christ) is said to be
the Elders of the church. Those elders are typically elected by the
congregation on a periodic basis (usually a term lasts about 3
years). Sometimes elders are elected by the drawing of lots.

Those who are elected to office serve their terms as the
spiritual/theological/moral/visionary leaders of the congregation.
They also then participate in the governance of the regional body
of churches (sometimes called a "classis") by sending delegates to
a classis meeting on a regular basis. The "classical" level of
church governance, in the presbyterian model, is not a higher
authority, but rather is seen as a "delegated" authority--one that
only derives it's power from the acquiescence of the Elders at the
local level.

In a similar manner, Classis will send a select number of delegates
to a still broader body of authority, sometimes called a Synod. The
Synod will meet regularly (yearly, for example) to discuss major
issues of theology and practice facing the whole denomination.
Synod too, however, does not have a "higher" authority, except
insofar as its "delegated" authority is accepted by classes and
local Elders.

In this structure it is important to note as well that the
"Reverend" or "Minister of the Word and Sacrament"--the Pastor--is
recognized essentially as one of the Elders with a specialized
role. The Pastor in this model of governance does not have special
authority beyond that of the Elders, except insofar as, due to
their role and training, they are recognized to be "expert" in the
spiritual and theological life of the local congregation.

Congregational polity draws its name from the independence of local
congregations from the authority and control of other religious
bodies. Paige Patterson has summarized congregational polity as
follows:

"The *Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church* defines
"congregationalism" as "that form of Church polity which rests on
the indepdendence and autonomy of each local church." According to
this source, the principles of democracy in church government rest
on the belief that Christ is the sole head of his church, the
members are all priests unto God, and these units are regarded each
as an outcrop and representative of the church universal."
(*Who Runs the Church?: 4 Views on Church Government*, Steven B.
Cowan, gen. ed., p. 135, Zondervan 2004)

Churches organized with a congregational polity may be involved in
conventions, districts or associations which allow them to share
common beliefs, cooperate in joint ministry efforts and regulate
clergy with other congregations. Churches organized with a
congregational polity generally disapprove of acknowledging
authority in councils or other proceedings involving delegates or
representatives from outside the local congregation. However,
congregational polity does not prevent a local congregation's
leadership from adopting the decision or position of another
congregation or a council or other gathering.

### Single elder/pastor led

In a congregational church led by a single elder/pastor, primary
leadership in all decisions and doctrinal determinations is vested
in a single leader. (*Who Runs the Church?*, p. 150-52) Typically,
this leader also performs the duties of a senior pastor/minister
and provides the preaching and teaching ministries for the church
in addition to administrative leadership. Often, a congregational
church led by a single elder/pastor was founded by that singular
leader or by a previous singular leader who appointed the present
leader.

Paige Patterson argues that, despite biblical evidence undeniably
exists in support of a plurality of elders, several factors support
the ascendancy of a principal elder as the singular leader of the
congregation. Those factors include: 1) the general pattern in the
Old and New Testaments (e.g. Moses, the judges, Peter, James the
brother of Jesus); 2) the pattern of the early church (e.g. John
Chrysostom in Antioch and at Saint Sophia's in Constantinople,
Augustine in Hippo, Jonathan Edwards in Northampton); 3) influence
of the synagogue on the church, including adoption by the church of
the "president of the synagogue" in the form of the
"pastor/elder/overseer"; and 4) the psychology of human leadership.
(*Who Runs the Church*, pp. 150-52)

Responding to Patterson, L. Roy Taylor raises concerns regarding
the accountability of this polity. Taylor, writing as a proponent
of Presbyterian polity, comments, "[I]n my estimation, it is easier
for a few knowledgeable and determined people to manipulate a
convention (congregationalism) than it is to manipulate a
deliberative body." (*Who Runs the Church?*, p. 164) Writing as a
proponent of plural elder congregationalism, Samuel E. Waldron
points out that a single-elder congregational polity is precisely
the model that led to episcopacy in the early church.
(*Who Runs the Church*, p. 177-78)

Patterson's position addresses common practices by Baptist churches
in America. It does not address single-elder congregational polity
structures common in Pentecostal, Charismatic and congregations
from other traditions. Though experience has brought about
modification of the more extreme manifestations, single-elder
congregationalism in some of these traditions consolidated
authority to the point of autocracy.

Concerns related to the more extreme forms of single-elder
congregationalism has resulted in more accountability within
Pentecostal congregations such as those affiliated with the
Assemblies of God. Also, common experience with the consequences of
unaccountable authority ranging from inappropriate use of church
finances all the way to the tragedy in Jonestown are often relied
upon by opponents of this structure in favor of increased
accountability.

Common in some [Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") and
[Congregational](Congregational "Congregational") churches.

### Democratic congregational

In a congregational church led by a democratically elected
leadership board or council, final authority for all decisions and
doctrinal determinations are vested in a plurality of
representative leaders selected by the congregation. The titles of
the individual leaders and the structure of the leadership board or
council varies.

One common use of this structure involves the election of "elders"
to an "elder board". The "elders" make business and spiritual
decisions for the congregation by committee and serve individually
as examples and mentors to the rest of the congregation. Often
"deacons" are also elected to provide leadership within specific
committees, ministries or administrative functions. Typically,
"deadons" are subordinate to the authority of the "elders". In some
congregational churches, "deacons" serve on a unified "board" with
the elders with equal voting authority.

Another comon use of this structure acknowledges the "pastor" as
the single "elder" for the congregation who participates in
decision-making with a "deacon board" comprised of the "pastor" and
"deacons" selected by the congregation. The "pastor" also typically
serves as chief executive officer for the congregation in
implementing the decisions of the leadership board on a day-to-day
basis.

Terminology and titles vary from church to church.

Common in [Baptist](Baptist "Baptist"),
[Congregational](Congregational "Congregational"), and
[Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran") churches.

### Plural elder-led

In a congregational church led by a plurality of elders, final
authority for all decisions and doctrinal determinations are vested
in a plurality of elders acting in committee. This structure is
very similar to the "elder board" approach to the democratic
congregational structure, often differing only in the method used
to select the elders and/or in the term of service of each elder.
In some congregations, elders are appointed by someone or some
entity respected by the congregation and allows this authority. In
some congregations, elders serve until they resign, die or are
removed by the congregation or their peers for doctrinal or moral
failures. This structure can, but does not always, include the use
of "deacons" or other leaders subordinate to the authority of the
elders.

Common in [Evangelical Free](Evangelical_Free "Evangelical Free")
churches and some [Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") churches.

## The biblical pattern

The three prominent forms of church government all appeal to the
Scriptures as well as church tradition for support of their
respective positions. Since the Bible is not silent on the subject,
key elements in the biblical examples are germane. Greg Bahnsen has
noted the following:[[3]](http://opc.org/OS/html/V4/1d.html)

-   There is no distinction between "elders" and "bishops" (Titus
    1:5-7; Acts 20:17, 28); these represent the same office and order.

-   Each [congregation](Congregation "Congregation") and center of
    leadership is to have a plurality of elders (Acts 14:23; 20:17;
    Phil. 1:1), not one-man rule.

-   These elders have oversight of the church (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet.
    5:2-3) and are thus responsible to rule the congregation (1 Tim.
    3:5; 5:17; 1 Thes. 5:12; Heb. 13:7, 17, 24). They judge among the
    brothers (cf. 1 Cor. 6:5) and, in contrast to all the members, they
    do the rebuking (1 Tim. 5:20). Christ calls them to use the “keys
    of the kingdom” to bind and loose (Matt.16: 19; 18: 18; John 20:
    23)—these keys being the preaching of the gospel (I John I :3),
    administering of the sacraments (Matt. 28:19-20; I Cor. 11: 23ff.),
    and the exercise of discipline (Matt. 18:17; I Cor. 5:1-5).

-   The elders are assisted in their ministry by "deacons" who give
    attention to the ministry of mercy (Phil. 1:1; Acts 6:1-6; cf. 1
    Tim. 3:8-13).

-   The office-bearers in the church are nominated and elected by
    the members of the congregation (e.g. Acts 6:5-6), but must also be
    examined, confirmed and ordained by the present board of elders
    (Acts 6:6; 13: 1-3; 1 Tim. 4: 14).

-   Members of the church have the right to appeal disputed matters
    in the congregation to their elders for resolution, and if the
    dispute is with those local elders, to appeal to the regional
    governing body (the presbytery) or, beyond that, to the whole
    general assembly (Acts 15). The decisions of the wider governing
    bodies are authoritative in all the local congregations (Acts
    15:22-23, 28, 30; 16:1-5).
