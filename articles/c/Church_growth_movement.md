The **church growth movement** is a philosophy that if a local
congregation is not growing numerically, it signifies that they are
diseased or dying. Rick Holland, pastor of Youth Ministries, Grace
Community Church, defined it as "an organized effort and strategy
to affect growth in the church which integrates biblical and
extra-biblical means."

It was advanced primarily by
[Donald McGavran](index.php?title=Donald_McGavran&action=edit&redlink=1 "Donald McGavran (page does not exist)")
in *The Bridges of God* (1955) and *Understanding Church Growth*
(1970).
[Robert Schuller](index.php?title=Robert_Schuller&action=edit&redlink=1 "Robert Schuller (page does not exist)")
has also trained key leaders in the movement such as
[Rick Warren](Rick_Warren "Rick Warren"),
[Bill Hybels](index.php?title=Bill_Hybels&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bill Hybels (page does not exist)"),
and
[John Maxwell](index.php?title=John_Maxwell&action=edit&redlink=1 "John Maxwell (page does not exist)")
at his Institute for Successful Church
Leadership.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
One premise that underscores the movement is that a congregation's
goals and strategies for growth should be determined by the
perceived needs of the community they serve.
