**Church history**, or the history of the
[Christian](Christianity "Christianity") Faith, began about 30 A.D.
in Palestine with a small number of Jews and Jewish Proselytes,
about 120 according to Acts 1:15, following the resurrection of
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"). By the third century
A.D., Christianity had grown to become the dominant religion of the
northern Mediterranean world. It also gained important extensions
to the east and south of the Mediterranean.

An overview of church history in chronological sections is given
below, beneath the multimedia section.

## Apostolic Age (30–100 AD)

The apostolic period extends from the Day of Pentecost to the death
of the Apostle John, and covers about seventy years, from A.D. 30
to about 100. The field of action is Palestine, and gradually
extends over Syria, Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy. The most
prominent centres are Jerusalem, Antioch, and Rome, which represent
respectively the mother churches of Jewish, Gentile, and United
Catholic Christianity. Next to them are Ephesus and Corinth.
Ephesus acquired a special importance by the residence and labors
of John, which made themselves felt during the second century
through Polycarp and Irenaeus. Samaria, Damascus, Joppa, Caesarea,
Tyre, Cyprus, the provinces of Asia Minor, Troas, Philippi,
Thessalonica, Beraea, Athens, Crete, Patmos, Malta, Puteoli, come
also into view as points where the Christian faith was planted.
Through the eunuch converted by Philip, it reached Candace, the
queen of the Ethiopians. As early as A.D. 58 Paul could say: "From
Jerusalem and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully
preached the gospel of Christ." He afterwards carried it to Rome,
where it had already been known before, and possibly as far as
Spain, the western boundary of the empire.^[[1]](#note-SchaffH3)^

## From the Apostles to the Council of Nicaea (100–325)

"The second period, from the death of the apostle John to the end
of the persecutions, or to the accession of Constantine, the first
Christian emperor, is the classic age of the *ecclesia pressa*, of
heathen persecution, and of Christian martyrdom and heroism, of
cheerful sacrifice of possessions and life itself for the
inheritance of heaven. It furnishes a continuous commentary on the
Saviour's words: "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of
wolves; I came not to send peace on earth, but a sword…"

> The church of this period appears poor in earthly possessions and
> honors, but rich in heavenly grace, in world-conquering faith,
> love, and hope; unpopular, even outlawed, hated, and persecuted,
> yet far more vigorous and expansive than the philosophies of Greece
> or the empire of Rome; composed chiefly of persons of the lower
> social ranks, yet attracting the noblest and deepest minds of the
> age, and bearing, in her bosom the hope of the world; "as unknown,
> yet well-known, as dying, and behold it lives;" conquering by
> apparent defeat, and growing on the blood of her martyrs; great in
> deeds, greater in sufferings, greatest in death for the honor of
> Christ and the benefit of generations to
> come.^[[2]](#note-Schaff22p)^

### The Apologists

In the second century conventionally educated converts began to
produce two kinds of writings that help us understand the
developing shapes of Christianity — works aimed at a broad audience
of educated non-Christians and works aimed at those who considered
themselves inside the Church. The writing for non-Christians is
usually called *apologetic* in the same sense that the speech given
by Socrates in his defense before the Athenian assembly is called
his Apology — the word in Greek meant "speech for the defense"
rather than the modern more limited denotation of "statement
expressing regret". The [Apologists](Apologetics "Apologetics"), as
these authors are sometimes known, made a presentation for the
educated classes of the beliefs of Christians, often coupled with
an attack on the beliefs and practices of the pagans. Other
writings had the purpose of instructing and admonishing fellow
Christians.

## From the Council of Nicaea to the Fall of the Roman Empire (325–590)

Momentous changes occurred both in the church and in the political
structure of the West during the fourth, fifth, and sixth
centuries. The Western Roman Empire disappeared under the repeated
assaults of the German barbarian tribes on its northern frontier.
Christianity, a persecuted minority faith at
[Constantine](Constantine "Constantine")'s conversion in AD 312,
had become the religion of the Empire by the end of the century.
The bishop of Rome, whose leadership in the church had been largely
a primacy of honour, now claimed supreme and universal authority in
Christian lands, and began to make good this claim in the West, at
least over the church. By the time of Pope Gregory I (590–604) the
collapse of the Western Empire left the Roman bishop the real ruler
of much of central Italy.^[[3]](#note-ToddHC139)^

## The Medieval Church and Scholasticism (590–1517)

The Middle Age may be divided into three
periods:^[[4]](#note-SchaffH4c1)^

-   The missionary period from Gregory I. to Hildebrand or Gregory
    VII., a.d. 590–1073. The conversion of the northern barbarians. The
    dawn of a new civilization. The origin and progress of
    [Islam](Islam "Islam"). The separation of the West from the East.
    Some subdivide this period by Charlemagne (800), the founder of the
    German-Roman Empire.

-   The palmy period of the papal theocracy from Gregory VII. to
    Boniface VIII., a.d. 1073–1294. The height of the papacy,
    monasticism and scholasticism. The Crusades. The conflict between
    the Pope and the Emperor. If we go back to the rise of Hildebrand,
    this period begins in 1049.

-   The decline of medieval Catholicism and preparation for modern
    Christianity, from Boniface VIII. to the Reformation, a.d.
    1294–1517. The papal exile and schism; the reformatory councils;
    the decay of scholasticism; the growth of mysticism; the revival of
    letters, and the art of printing; the discovery of America;
    forerunners of Protestantism; the dawn of the Reformation.

-   [Scholasticism](Scholasticism "Scholasticism")

## The Reformation (1517–1648)

The Reformation of the sixteenth century is, next to the
introduction of Christianity, the greatest event in history. It
marks the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of modern times.
Starting from religion, it gave, directly or indirectly, a mighty
impulse to every forward movement, and made Protestantism the chief
propelling force in the history of modern
civilization.^[[5]](#note-SchaffH7c1)^

    (1545–1563)

## The Enlightenment Church (1648–1789)

The Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason, was a time when
man began to use his reason to discover the world, casting off the
superstition and fear of the medieval world. The effort to discover
the natural laws which governed the universe led to scientific,
political and social advances. Enlightenment thinkers examined the
rational basis of all beliefs and in the process rejected the
authority of church and state. Immanuel Kant expressed the motto of
the Enlightenment well — "Aude Sapere" (Dare to
Think!).^[[6]](#note-Enlghtnmnt)^
