Membership requires both discipleship and love (cf. John 13:8).
**Church membership** affiliates an individual believer with a
specific local congregation. It is often a formalized public
declaration of commitment to the church (*e.g.* baptism, profession
of faith, personal testimony, church rolls), in a manner that
varies depending on the customs of the congregation. Many modern,
independent churches reject the idea of membership, believing it to
be an unnecessary and human addition to belonging to Christ and to
the "invisible church".

Church membership viewed biblically is an obligation of
discipleship and love that derives from being united with
[Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") by [grace](Grace "Grace")
through [faith](Faith "Faith"), and from the discipline that the
Lord Jesus Christ has committed to the church, to preserve its
orderliness, purity and peace.

Membership, in this sense, is assumed throughout the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), and taught
explicitly. For example, [Paul](Paul "Paul") teaches that
Christians are members of one another as well of Christ, and that
this unity is visible and practical in the church. He likens the
visible church to a physical body of which Christ is the head, to
which believers are joined and held together by love.

*... we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. - (Romans 12:5)'*
*... speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love. - (Ephesians 4:15, 16)*
For the purpose of caring for and strengthening this body, and for
the cooperative action of all of its members, the grace of Christ
provides leaders:

*... he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ. - (Ephesians 4:11)*
This discipline is not optional to the Christian life, but is
enjoined by the command of the word of God:
*Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls.*
(Hebrews 13:17)

The apostle likens those outside of this government to
*children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.*
(Ephesians 4:14)

These duties and privileges of love in the visible church, which
constitute the orderliness and ministry of the church that is
incumbent upon every member of Christ, might be represented in
modern churches by customary conventions such as membership rolls,
public profession, baptismal records, membership vows,
congregational meetings, the privilege of voting, church courts,
judicial procedures, and the like. It is easy to be misled by such
human, mundane institutional and courtroom language, about the
divine character and spiritual nature of church membership.

## History

The history of church membership in
[Evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical") churches begins with the
[Catholic Church](Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"), which
implements its discipline over all the baptized, through a
traditional [sacramental system](Sacraments "Sacraments"),
governing the progressions of life from cradle to grave.
Essentially, in this way the church presses the insistence upon
every baptized child that he is "in" unless he insisted on being
"out", and the sacramental system was designed to strengthen his
piety through which he might hope for
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation").

For a beginning contrast, the
[Reformers](Reformation "Reformation") only acknowledged two
sacraments: [Baptism](Baptism "Baptism") and the
[Lord's table](Communion "Communion"), and placed a much stronger
emphasis on faith as the only instrument by which the grace of God
is effectual for salvation. Furthermore, the
[Radical Reformation](Radical_Reformation "Radical Reformation"),
and the [Baptist movement](Baptist "Baptist") later, asserted that
baptism is only valid if voluntary
("[believer's baptism](Believer's_baptism "Believer's baptism")").
These two departures from Catholic practice immediately produced a
variety of approaches to membership in Protestant churches.
National churches adopted some version of a
[parish](index.php?title=Parish&action=edit&redlink=1 "Parish (page does not exist)")
system. In these cases geography was significant of jurisdiction,
as in the Roman Catholic Church, so that it was not exceptional for
members of the parish, though baptized, never to
[profess Christian faith](index.php?title=Profession_of_faith&action=edit&redlink=1 "Profession of faith (page does not exist)").
Furthermore, it is under these assumptions of geographical
jurisdiction that dissenting groups were subject to church censures
and civil persecution. But the core principles of the Reformation
naturally gave weight to [conversion](Conversion "Conversion"), to
conscience, and thus to voluntarism which is most radically
expressed by the [Anabaptists](Anabaptist "Anabaptist") and the
Baptists (in which the discipline of membership can only be entered
into pursuant to the expressed will of those who profess faith, and
can be dissolved in the same way).

Between these two opposite directions, the Independents of England
(the
[Congregationalists](index.php?title=Congregational_churches&action=edit&redlink=1 "Congregational churches (page does not exist)"))
were a middle ground. They adopted a view similar to the
Anabaptists, that the covenantal relation between the church and
its members is literally a contract between two consenting parties.
However, unlike the Anabaptists, Congregationalists practice infant
baptism, which is not voluntary. The basic dilemma which faces
Congregationalism's contractual view of the church is, how to
regard the status of those who have been baptized but have not made
a credible profession of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. And what
was to be done with those who, like
[Roger Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Williams_(theologian) "w:Roger Williams (theologian)"),
thought the church was in error and demanded separation?

Especially in America, this became a delicate issue, because the
Independent Puritans had tied civil privileges to church
membership, much as did the national churches that resulted from
the Reformation. And, because the history of the
[Presbyterian church](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") is identical to
that of the Congregationalists in the early history of the colonies
in America, these churches inherited some of the political
reasoning, as well as some of the problems, of the
Congregationalists' contractual conception of the church. Some of
these issues are encountered by all Evangelical churches in a Free
church tradition or situation (not a national church), as in the
United States.

The
[Puritan dilemma](index.php?title=Puritan_dilemma&action=edit&redlink=1 "Puritan dilemma (page does not exist)")
can be illustrated by the early history of the
Congregationalists/Presbyterians in America. The
[Half-Way Covenant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Stoddard#The_Halfway_Covenant "w:Solomon Stoddard"),
adopted by the synods of 1657 and 1662, had made baptism alone the
condition to the civil privileges of church membership, but not of
participation in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Solomon
Stoddard, had been even more liberal, holding that the Supper was a
converting ordinance and that baptism was a sufficient title to all
the privileges of the church.^[[1]](#note-0)^
[Jonathan Edwards](Jonathan_Edwards "Jonathan Edwards") had argued
that admittance to the Lord's Supper required an identifiable
personal crisis of conversion.

Added to this problem and its unique history in the Presbyterian
church, there is also the enormous cultural influence of the
Baptists, which strongly emphasizes the individual and the
voluntary aspects of membership in a church. Children in Baptist
churches are members of Christian families, but not members of the
Church until they profess faith and are baptized. The Baptist view
of the church easily adapted to, and instigated the perfection of,
complete separation of church membership from civic privilege and
obligation.

In this environment, a strong current of voluntarism swept through
churches of all traditions, especially in the 19th century (the
"[Second Great Awakening](Great_awakenings "Great awakenings")").
This broad cultural movement even more completely frustrated any
view of church membership and discipline beyond the local
congregation, and in practice the individual's decision to join or
to depart from the church is completely determinative of his
standing in the church - the very idea of "status of membership"
became descriptive only of whether the believer chooses to
associate himself, or not.

This does not necessarily result in a lax view of membership,
however, in the context of the local congregation. Membership in
the local congregation, whether viewed as a mystical bond (as in
[Shepherding churches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherding_Movement "w:Shepherding Movement")),
or as essentially a legal contract between the individual and the
body (the Congregationalist theory) is sometimes taken with extreme
seriousness. However, the actions of one congregation do not bind
another, except at the discretion of the other congregation.
Regardless of the polity of the denomination, this presumption of
the radical prerogatives of the individual prevails in American
churches by sheer force of cultural momentum.

In reaction to the general collapse of the idea of
**church membership**, some churches associated with the Reformed
movement have attempted to implement a very restrictive version of
the contractual conception of the church.
[Gary North](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_North "w:Gary North")
succinctly described this legal view of membership, when he wrote,
"There are only three lawful ways out of a local congregation: by
death, by letter of transfer, and by
[excommunication](index.php?title=Excommunication&action=edit&redlink=1 "Excommunication (page does not exist)")."
This has produced a controversy in some circles, especially where
congregations move from a position in which membership is seen as
essentially voluntary to a belief that church membership is a
contract that cannot be voluntarily dissolved. Particularly, where
infant baptism is practiced, the result has been a re-discovery in
a fresh context of the Puritan dilemma, of centuries ago. This is
especially problematic where the submission of the members is not
balanced by a leadership that is itself subject to discipline. With
the proliferation of
[paedocommunion](Paedocommunion "Paedocommunion") in some quarters,
a new element is added to that dilemma. ^[[2]](#note-1)^ This
debate over the status of membership underscores a more meaningful
debate about the connection between formal Church membership and
conversion.^[[3]](#note-2)^

## Reformed church membership

The typical Free church view of membership is seen in the Reformed
denominations, in the United States. Conversion experiences of
various stages and kinds are expected, but these are not the
pre-requisite of membership. A public profession of faith is
required however, before taking communion or participating in the
government of the church. Membership normally includes voluntary
submission to leadership, usually attested by vows. However, these
vows are not usually interpreted in a strictly legal sense, and
therefore these churches sometimes explicitly provide an expedient
for dealing with cases in which the member is no longer willing to
be subject to the discipline of the church. Some procedures mention
"renunciation of jurisdiction", which means that the member rejects
the authority of this particular church at this point in time. In
any case the grant or revocation of membership is an act of the
church, and is not a strictly voluntary matter.

### [OPC](OPC "OPC")

In the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, membership can only be granted
or terminated by the decision of the session, which will take into
account but not be determined by the individual's desires. In their
view good order assumes the voluntary submission of the member to
the government of the church, through faith in Christ (as indicated
by their vows); but if this is lacking the session has the "option
of discretion", and may dissolve membership if the session believes
that it is in the spiritual interest of the member. This may be
done as an alternative to other forms of discipline over a member
who has indicated a desire to renounce membership in a disorderly
way, in which case the OPC sees erasure as a form of discipline,
"*tantamount to excommunication*" ^[[4]](#note-3)^. This allows the
session to terminate other forms of discipline even in cases where
a judicial form of discipline has already been initiated.
^[[5]](#note-4)^ The right of appeal is provided for every final
judicial action, which includes erasure. ^[[6]](#note-5)^

Typical of Reformed churches, members are received one of 4
ways^[[7]](#note-6)^:

1.  Through transfer
    (*from a church of like faith and practice approved by the session, including OPC churches*)
2.  Through reaffirmation of faith
    (*previously confessed his faith and united with a church other than a church of like faith and practice*)
3.  Confession of faith
    (*not previously been a communicant member of the church*)
4.  By baptism:
    -   Noncommunicant unbaptized children whose parent(s) are members
        of the church shall be received by baptism.
    -   Noncommunicant baptized members may be received with their
        parent(s).


Membership can only be terminated by the session, in cases
of:^[[8]](#note-7)^

1.  Transfer out (II.B.3.a,b)
2.  Erasure:
    1.  Leaving without permission of the session (variety of
        circumstances: II.B.3.d.1,3,5)
    2.  A desire to no longer be in fellowship with the session
        (II.B.3.d.2)
    3.  After being missing for 2 years

3.  By ordination as a teaching elder
4.  Excommunication
5.  Death

### [PCA](PCA "PCA")

In the Presbyterian Church in America, all baptized persons
(including non-communicant members)
*are entitled to the watchful care, instruction and government of the church, even though they are adults and have made no profession of their faith in Christ*.
(6-3) Thus
*All baptized persons, being members of the Church are subject to its discipline and entitled to the benefits thereof*
(27-2)
*Communing members are those who have made a profession of faith in Christ, have been baptized, and have been admitted by the Session to the Lord's Table.*^[[9]](#note-8)^

A member has a positive obligation to transfer his membership upon
moving geographically outside the bounds of the congregation.
(46-1)

1.  A member may transfer out (38-3a)
2.  Affiliating with another church which is
    *failing to maintain the Word and Sacraments in their fundamental integrity*
    then they are erased (38-3b)
3.  Being absent for one year (38-4), (46-2)

### [PC(USA)](PC(USA) "PC(USA)")

The Presbyterian Church (USA) recognizes an obligation on the part
of the congregation to allow persons to join in membership
^[[10]](#note-9)^

Any persons may enter into active church membership in the
following ways: by profession of faith, reaffirmation of faith in
Jesus Christ, or transfer of certificate from some other church.
They divide their membership into 4 classes Baptized (baptized but
no profession of faith), Active (made a profession of faith),
Inactive (member that does not participate), Affiliate (an active
member of another church attending). Members, church officers,
elders and ministers have the right to renounce jurisdiction at any
time.

### [EPC](EPC "EPC")

The Evangelical Presbyterian Church recognizes:^[[11]](#note-10)^

-   **Confirmed Members**: Those who have been baptized and who
    have made a public profession of their faith and been admitted to
    active membership by the Church Session
-   **Baptized Members**: Baptized children of members
-   **Affiliate Members**: Persons separated geographically from
    their home church
-   **Inactive Members**: These are members who have not attended
    within the last year yet have not yet gone another year and been
    erased.

They see membership as a right,
*The Church Session may not deny membership for any reason not related to profession of faith and obedience*.
(BOG9-2A) The EPC also provides a formal process which **requires**
the session to accept any member's renunciation of jurisdiction,
either in writing or verbal. ^[[12]](#note-11)^

### CRCNA

The CRCNA is restrictive in terms of allowing persons to consider
themselves no longer a member ^[[13]](#note-12)^

Rules for Lapsing of Nonattending and Nonsupporting Members Synod
decided that with respect to a baptized or confessing member who,
for a period of at least two years, has not moved but fails to
attend and support the congregation that holds the person’s
membership, the consistory may declare that person’s membership has
lapsed. This may be done when all the following conditions are
present:

a. The person claims to be still committed to the Christian faith.
b. The person claims to be worshiping elsewhere.
c. The consistory is not aware of any public sin requiring
discipline.
They believe that
*this provision has become necessary because of the increasing trend on the part of many churches and fellowships to ignore or reject the significance of membership in the visible church.... This will assist consistories, who at present face the alternative of taking no effective action with such a member or proceeding to erase or excommunicate such a member from the body of Christ, by providing a way of removing the person from the membership rolls without being required to pass judgment on that person’s relationship to the church universal.*

### [NAPARC](index.php?title=NAPARC&action=edit&redlink=1 "NAPARC (page does not exist)")

NAPARC is not a denomination itself but rather a group of churches
which have entered into fraternal relations. In attempting to
reduce friction between member churches ^[[14]](#note-13)^ they
have created a set of 4 rules that in effect create involuntary
church membership.

1.  Members have the right to transfer out of a congregation which
    grants them permission
2.  That churches may not receive members until the church they are
    leaving is satisfied.
3.  That the church a member is attempting to leave from may bring
    against the receiving church of the interchurch relations
    committees
4.  That similar rules are observed for congregations wishing to
    leave denominations

This agreement has been adopted by the 16th PCA
[[6]](http://www.pcahistory.org/pca/2-437.html) and by the OPC
[[7]](http://www.opc.org/relations/transfers.html).

## Catholic Church membership

The Catholic Church has always held that the bible gives for 3
criteria for membership.^[[15]](#note-14)^

1.  Profess the true Faith, and have received the Sacrament of
    Baptism.
2.  Acknowledge the authority of the Church and of her appointed
    rulers.
3.  Not be excommunicated as a result of sin

Most Catholic literature about people who leave the faith assumes
one is joining a heretical or schismatic church and thus the heresy
or schism in itself constitutes an excommunication. However it is
possible to leave the church voluntarily without specifically
joining another (which would be the closest equivalent of erasure
or "renouncement of jurisdiction"). The process here requires an
assertion of understanding: that is they have required that a
person must

1.  Perform an **act** to indicate they wish to separate (mere
    thought is not enough).
2.  The act must be **persistent** that is it must take place over
    a long period of time, in particular it can't be a single event.
3.  The person must be **contumacious** that is they must be firm
    in their conviction and not express hesitation.
4.  They must be **aware** that their acts can lead to
    excommunication. In particular they must be aware of what they are
    requesting.
5.  Finally they must actually **be a member**. The church cannot
    expel non members (the pope is exempted from this).
