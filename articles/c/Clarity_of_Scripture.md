The [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of the **clarity of Scripture**
(often called the "perspicuity of Scripture") teaches that "the
meanings of the text can be clear to the ordinary reader, that God
uses the text of the [Bible](Bible "Bible") to communicate His
person and will." [[1]](http://www.foclnews.org/v0501.htm) "The
witness of the Church throughout the ages is that ordinary people,
who approach it in faith and humility, will be able to understand
what the Bible is getting at, even if they meet with particular
points of difficulty here and there."
[[2]](http://www.episcopalian.org/efac/articles/clarity.htm)

This doctrine is in contrast to other positions like that of the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church"),
which asserts that Scripture is imperspicuous (unclear) apart from
the interpretative framework of the Catholic church and
tradition^[[1]](#note-0)^, and of positions like that of
[Postmodernism](Postmodernism "Postmodernism") and
[Mormonism](Mormonism "Mormonism"), which assert that subjective
experience should be preferred over knowing the originally intended
meaning of scripture, since it is basically unclear.

Christians who promote the clarity of the Bible encourage others to
read it for themselves. Those who deny the perspicuity of the Bible
have not historically encouraged a personal devotional time of
studying the Bible, and have even "denied free access to the
Scriptures lest [others] interpret them improperly and disseminate
false doctrine."
[[3]](http://www.westernseminary.edu/papers/Faculty/perspicuity.doc)

The issue of perspicuity is not entirely unique to the Bible, as it
concerns the basic principles of
[hermeneutics](Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics") which are relevant to
all texts. That the scripture is clear does not ensure, however,
that man will receive it for what it is. Man is
[depraved](Total_depravity "Total depravity") and needs the
[illumination of the Holy Spirit](Illumination_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Illumination of the Holy Spirit")
in order to see the meaning for what it is.

## Biblical arguments for clarity

God in His wisdom anticipated that we would fumble on this idea
about whether or not His Word would be misunderstood,
misinterpreted and misapplied, and addressed this very issue
through the lips (and pen) of His servant Moses to His children -

> "For this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for
> you, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that you should
> say, 'Who will ascend to heaven for us and bring it to us, that we
> may hear it and do it?' Neither is it beyond the sea, that you
> should say, 'Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us,
> that we may hear it and do it?' But the word is very near you. It
> is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you can do it."
> (Deuteronomy 30:11-14)

God's Word was never intended to be esoteric, dark, enigmatic,
cryptic, abstruse, obscure, ambiguous, occluded, enshrouded,
inscrutable, or vague. Rather, it is a perfect, sure, right, pure,
clean and true light, illuminating the character and plan of God -

> "The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony
> of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of the
> LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is
> pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of the LORD is clean,
> enduring forever; the rules of the LORD are true, and righteous
> altogether." (Psalm 19:7-9) "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a
> light to my path." "The unfolding of your words gives light; it
> imparts understanding to the simple." (Psalm 119:105,130)

Paul asserts to the church in Corinth that his letters have been
straight-forward, and there is nothing written between the lines
and nothing we can't understand -

> "For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read
> and acknowledge and I hope you will fully acknowledge--just as you
> did partially acknowledge us, that on the day of our Lord Jesus you
> will boast of us as we will boast of you." (2 Corinthians 1:13-14)

Paul also exhorts and encourages the church in Philippi regarding
the clarity of God's message -

> "All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if
> on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear
> to you. Only let us live up to what we have already attained."
> (Philippians 3:15-16)

Paul also tells Timothy (who had understood Scripture from
childhood) that the Word of God is profitable. How is it to be
profitable if it is not understood? Furthermore, its purpose is
that the man of God may be competent. He does not say that only the
competent man of God will be equipped. No, he indicates that the
Word itself has the power for teaching, reproving, correcting and
training -

> "But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly
> believed, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood
> you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able
> to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All
> Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for
> reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that
> the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work." (2
> Timothy 3:14-17)

The writer of Hebrews reminds us that God's Word is not some
lifeless document that needs some kind of special insight to
comprehend it, but that it is "living and active, sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of
joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of
the heart."

  
Peter echoes these thoughts on the sufficiency and perspicuity of
Scripture -

> "His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life
> and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his
> own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his
> precious and very great promises, so that through them you may
> become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the
> corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire." (2 Peter
> 1:3-4) "For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made
> known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we
> were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For when he received honor and
> glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the
> Majestic Glory, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
> pleased,' we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for
> we were with him on the holy mountain. And we have something more
> sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay
> attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns
> and the morning star rises in your hearts, knowing this first of
> all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own
> interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of
> man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy
> Spirit." (2 Peter 1:16-21)

## Abuses and qualifications

"When this position is taken to an extreme (as it has been by some
Protestants) the individual becomes the supreme authority on the
meaning of Scripture, claiming revelation from the Holy Spirit to
authenticate an interpretation not necessarily validated by the
Church as a whole."
[[4]](http://www.westernseminary.edu/papers/Faculty/perspicuity.doc)

## Common objections

If Scripture is clear, why are there so many Protestant
denominations? Why can't Protestants agree among themselves about
the meaning of Scripture?

The reasons for disagreement do not lie in the Scriptures
themselves but in the baggage many people bring to the Scriptures.
Many denominations have creeds or statements of faith that they use
as a norm to define themselves. In doing so they tend to view
Scripture through the lens of their stated beliefs. In other cases
some have attached themselves strongly to a Biblical principle but
to the neglect of other equally valid principles. In still other
cases some people inherit their faith from their forefathers
without questioning the belief.

It seems the tendency of people not to have any sense of history
earlier than what they have experienced. They tend to believe that
what they have known is the way it has always been. For this
reason, they see little reason to question their own inherited
beliefs and practices.

Division as a practical matter is often more a problem of the heart
than an intellectual dispute. Division, after all, is a work of the
flesh (Gal. 5:19-21). In many cases pride and a sectarian spirit
longed for a doctrinal dispute in order to justify itself. The
attitude sought out a reason for dividing, and some doctrinal
difference, sometimes any doctrinal difference, became a convenient
means for separation.

## Helpful quotes

-   "When the Protestant Reformers spoke about the perspicuity of
    Scripture, they meant that the Bible was clear when it came to its
    central message. Contrary to the dominant Roman Catholic idea which
    said that the Bible was difficult and obscure, Protestants said
    that anyone who is literate could comprehend the gospel and the
    Scriptures. The Reformers were not saying that all of Scripture was
    equally understandable or even that scholarly study wasn't
    necessary, what they were saying was that the essential clarity of
    the Word of God was self-evident. Bottom line, they were saying
    that the Roman idea, that the Magisterium, (or the teaching office)
    of the church was the only one that could interpret Scripture, was
    simply in error. Responsible interpretation of the Bible by those
    in the pews was not only accepted, but also encouraged." -
    [Hank Hanegraaff](Hank_Hanegraaff "Hank Hanegraaff")
    [[5]](http://www.equip.org/free/CP1014.htm)
-   "Belief in the perspicuity of the Bible is ancient, going back
    to Jesus himself, who reproached the scribes and Pharisees, for not
    understanding the plain meaning of the text. As a doctrine, the
    perspicuity of Scripture was expressed by many of the Church
    Fathers, who contrasted it with the mystical writings of the
    Gnostics, which only the initiated could fathom." - Gerald Bray
    [[6]](http://www.episcopalian.org/efac/articles/clarity.htm)
-   "But, if many things still remain abstruse to many, this does
    not arise from obscurity in the Scriptures, but from [our] own
    blindness or want [i.e. lack] of understanding, who do not go the
    way to see the all-perfect clearness of the truth... Let,
    therefore, wretched men cease to impute, with blasphemous
    perverseness, the darkness and obscurity of their own heart to the
    all-clear scriptures of God... If you speak of the internal
    clearness, no man sees one iota in the Scriptures, but he that hath
    the Spirit of God... If you speak of the external clearness,
    nothing whatever is left obscure or ambiguous; but all things that
    are in the Scriptures, are by the Word brought forth into the
    clearest light, and proclaimed to the whole world." -
    [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"),
    *Bondage of the Will*

-   "But Ingham is wrong to suggest that everything, including
    Easter, is a mystery. We have learned from Heisenberg's Certainty
    Principle that the vast majority of the objects we encounter in the
    physical world are firmly in the classical domain, where they can
    be objectively observed and measured. Similarly in Christian
    theology, the core truths of the Christian faith are clearly and
    objectively laid out for us in scripture we are a People of the
    Book rather than a mystery sect. That is not to say that we have
    nothing more to learn about them when we meet God in heaven. Now
    the apostle tells us we see through a glass darkly; but then face
    to face: now we know in part; but then we shall know even as we are
    known (1 Cor 13:12). Yes our mortal vision is limited, but at the
    core of the Gospel is the good news that God, recognizing our
    veiled eyes, has revealed Himself in Jesus in such a way that even
    veiled eyes can understand the essential truths (2 Cor 4:6)." -

## Notes

1.  [↑](#ref-0) e.g. [Augustine](Augustine "Augustine"), in
    *Against the Epistle of Manichaeus*, wrote that he would not even
    believe the gospel "except moved by the authority of the Catholic
    Church," and in *On Christian Doctrine*, says "Let the reader
    consult the rule of faith which he has gathered from the plainer
    passages of scripture, and from the authority of the Church,...";
    Vincent of Lerins (AD 434) concurs, "Therefore, on account of the
    number and variety of errors, there is a need for someone to lay
    down a rule for the interpretation of the prophets and the apostles
    in such a way that it is directed by the rule of the catholic
    church."
