Clark Pinnock
**Clark H. Pinnock** (1937-2010), professor Emeritus of Christian
Interpretation, McMaster Divinity College, Hamilton, Ontario, is an
evangelical theologian and primary proponent of the
[Openness of God](Open_Theism "Open Theism") movement.

Pinnock received his PhD in New Testament at Manchester University
in 1963 under [F.F. Bruce](F.F._Bruce "F.F. Bruce"). Originally a
[Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism"), Pinnock migrated to a generally
[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") theology. From 1969 to 1974
Pinnock taught at
[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School](Trinity_Evangelical_Divinity_School "Trinity Evangelical Divinity School"),
Deerfield, Illinois, and from 1974 to 1977 at Regent College in
Vancouver. He taught at McMaster Divinity College from 1977 until
his retirement in 2002.

He has authored numerous books including,
*A Wideness in God's Mercy* (1992), co-edited *The Openness of God*
(1994), and *Most Moved Mover: A Theology of God's Openness*
(2001). In addition to his controversial
[open theism](Open_theism "Open theism"), Pinnock has argued for
[annihilationism](Annihilationism "Annihilationism") versus an
eternal [Hell](Hell "Hell") and an
[inclusivism](Inclusivism "Inclusivism") wherein Christianity is
uniquely true but people of other faiths can be saved without
explicit belief in Jesus Christ.

## Controversial theology

The two most controversial elements of Pinnock's theology in recent
years has been his affirmation of
[Open Theism](Open_Theism "Open Theism") and his affirmation of an
[annihilationist](Annihilationism "Annihilationism") view of
[hell](Hell "Hell") that says that the unsaved will experience
extinction rather than eternal conscious torment.
[Norman Geisler](Norman_Geisler "Norman Geisler") and
[Roger Nicole](Roger_Nicole "Roger Nicole") questioned whether
Pinnock's views are compatible with the Evangelical Theological
Society's affirmation of
[biblical inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy"). As a result Pinnock,
along with [John Sanders](John_Sanders "John Sanders"), on the
issue of whether they should be removed from the membership of that
organization was brought to a vote in November 2003. Pinnock
maintained that he did affirm the Society's doctrinal statement.
After clarifying his views to the satisfaction of Nicole, the
motion to remove Pinnock failed to reach the required two-thirds
majority by a sizable margin (Sanders was also retained albeit on a
close vote). It is fair to say that Pinnock remains a controversial
figure among evangelical theologians. ^[[1]](#note-0)^
