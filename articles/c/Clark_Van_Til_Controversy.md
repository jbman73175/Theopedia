The **Clark-Van Til Controversy** occurred in the 1940's, revolved
around the relation of knowledge to the incomprehensibility of God,
and involved the professor of philosophy
[Gordon H. Clark](Gordon_Clark "Gordon Clark") and the
[Westminster Seminarian](Westminster_Theological_Seminary "Westminster Theological Seminary")
[Cornelius Van Til](Cornelius_Van_Til "Cornelius Van Til"). Its
initial ripples were felt throughout the conservative Presbyterian
community and remain matters of serious theological, historical,
and philosophical concern.
