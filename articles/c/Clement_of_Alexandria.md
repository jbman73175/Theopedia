Clement of Alexandria
**Titus Flavius Clemens** (c. 150 - c. 215), he is called
**Clement of Alexandria** to distinguish him from
[Clement of Rome](Clement_of_Rome "Clement of Rome"). A Greek
theologian, he was born in Athens, traveled widely and was
converted to Christianity. He studied and taught at the
catechetical school in Alexandria until the persecution of 202.
[Origen](Origen "Origen") was his pupil there. He probably died in
Caesarea, Cappadocia. Clement was one of the first to attempt a
synthesis of Platonic and Christian thought; in this his successors
in the Alexandrian school were more successful. Only a few works
survive. The *Address to the Greeks* sets forth the inferiority of
Greek thought to Christianity. Appended to the *Tutor* are two
hymns, among the earliest Christian poems. His homily,
*Who Is the Rich Man? Who Is Saved?* is a well-written fragment.
The *Miscellanies* is a collection of notes on
[Gnosticism](Gnosticism "Gnosticism"). He attacked Gnosticism, but
he himself has been called a Christian Gnostic. Although Clement
remained entirely orthodox, in his writing he strove to state the
faith in terms of contemporary thought.
