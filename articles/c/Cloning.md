Reproducing animals and humans without the joint help of males and
females is called **Cloning**. Theoretically it is possible to
recreate an entire animal or human from a single cell, and that is
why cloning is often called a process of carbon-copying or
Xeroxing. Just as a carbon-copy is identical with the original, a
clone would also be identical with the original creature.

While theoretically it is possible for scientists to think of
creating an entire creature from a single cell, there are many
practical barriers. Many have been experimenting with these
barriers now for over a century, and finally a breakthrough has
been achieved in sheep and monkeys.

## The existence of natural cloning

Though cloning of mammals succeeded only in 1977, scientists
received their clue to the possibility of cloning much easier from
nature itself. For example, when a farmer breaks off a branch from
a tree and obtains an entirely new one by planting it in the
ground, it is an asexual reproduction. Thus it is a type of
cloning.

There are a variety of asexual multiplication in plants and trees,
and farmers and gardeners use these methods regularly and without
any surprise. That is because this capacity for direct cloning has
been built into these plants by the Creator himself.

In humans also a similar process takes place when twins are formed
in a mother's womb. Once the sperm and the ovum merge with each
other, a single cell is formed. This cell then grows and divides
itself into a bi-cellular stage. Then these grow and change into a
four-cellular stage, eight-celled organism, and so on. All during
these stages of growth, all these cells are intimately united with
each other, and are a single person -- the child to be born.
However, sometimes mistakes do take place during cell division.

In rare cases, the cells not only divide themselves, but also get
separated from each other. Each fragment then starts functioning as
an individual human being, and grows to the full human baby from
that stage. This is why some women give birth to two or more
identical children. They are identical because they came into
existence by the division of a single cell. They are copies of each
other.

When a single cell splits up into two identical cells or more, and
when each one grows independently, this is cloning. Though the
sexual process produces only one life, the splitting up produces
more than one person asexually. We do not marvel at this because
this is a process for which God himself has given the capacity to
human beings. Further, HE himself has made provisions for the safe
growth of the multiple embryos. It is totally different matter,
however, to mimic these in a scientific laboratory.

## Reason why asexual cloning is possible

Cloning, or asexual reproduction, is possible because each cell of
a living organism contains all the information that is necessary
for the development and nurturing of the entire organism. Thus if
somehow man is able to use the genetic information from a single
cell, he can create the entire creature out of it. This information
resides on the genes.

To understand this it would be helpful to look at a cell of a
mammal. A living cell is a very complex factory, having (what we
can call) tens of thousands of machines and hundreds of thousands
of components. Out of this let us consider only two major parts:
the cell and the nucleus. The nucleus contains many components,
with the most important being the Chromosomes. The chromosomes
carry the DNA, the carrier of genetic information. The DNA on a
single human cell contain enough information to fill an entire set
of the Encyclopedia Britannica (30 volumes). These DNA contain all
information about how his organs are going to function, and
numerous such information needed to make him a functioning living
being.

Though all cells contain the same number of Chromosomes, the
reproductive cells contain only half as much. Thus when a sperm and
ovum unite, half of the chromosomes are contributed by each parent.
Thus in each child there is a mixture of ancestral chromosomes, and
this mixing process ensures that most of the harmful genetic
diseases are kept in control.

Since each and every cell contains all the information necessary to
create the entire creature, allowing the cell to multiply and grow
should result in a mature creature from a single cell. This is the
principle behind cloning. This is how a plants grow from stems cut
from them. This is how a single cell, when accidentally separated
into two, gives rise to identical twins. The capacity for a type of
cloning is built into these organisms. But even here there are some
restrictions.

To get a new plant from a stem, it has to have a certain minimum
maturity. A stem lying outside this range would not grow roots and
leaves in most cases. Similarly, twins are formed in humans only
when certain favourable conditions are present, but not otherwise.



## Difficulties in cloning

Cloning is not difficult at all in those plants and animals in
which God has given them a capacity for doing so. We only have to
observe certain restrictions like choosing a mature stem in the
case of plants.

Cloning is more difficult, but still possible, in certain reptiles.
It must be noted, however, that many of these reptiles already have
the capacity for asexual reproduction. Since the capacity of
asexual reproduction is built into them, this results in relative
relative ease in cloning them in the laboratory. The case of
mammals and humans is different.

In mammals and the humans the cells acquire specific
responsibilities after crossing a threshold. This might be after
the I6-cell stage, or a bit before or after that. Before reaching
the threshold, which varies from organism to organism, all the
cells are identical. A mature replica of the original creature can
be reproduced from any of these cells at this stage. But after
crossing the threshold, the cells start to specialize. It is the
same original cell with all the original DNA but now one becomes a
skin cell, and yet another a nerve cell.

Once a cell starts functioning as a specialized cell, it somehow
turns "off" all the genetic information not needed by it. Thus even
though it contains all the original genetic material, all the
non-relevant information becomes dormant. Thus even if it is grown
by some process, it would not be able to grow the original creature
out of it. Skin cells would multiply only into skin cells, and
nerves only into nerve cells -- though they actually contain all
the chromosomes and all the genetic information inside them. This
is the difficulty in cloning mammals from their matured cells.

In mammals and humans only their reproductive cells (sperms and
ova) make all the information available that resides on their
chromosomes. Thus it has been possible for scientists to perform
many kinds of surgical manipulations upon sperms and ova, but the
same could not be done on mature non-reproductive cells due to
their specialization.

Specialization (after a certain growth) is a definite barrier kept
by the Creator in all kinds of organisms. Cloning a new creature
from these specialized cells has been a very difficult task because
of this barrier. But now even this barrier has been overcome in
some mammals, though only time will tell whether it will ultimately
result in good or bad.

## Bible, ethics, and cloning

Though certain kinds of cloning are already available in nature,
this does not automatically justify man's attempt at cloning other
organisms. The very fact that only certain types of cloning are
available in nature indicates some kind of a boundary. Boundaries
are indicated in [Genesis](Genesis "Genesis") when [God](God "God")
says that living creatures should reproduce after their kind.

The need for respecting boundaries are indicated in the
[Scriptures](Scripture "Scripture") where mixing of certain plants
and animals are forbidden. These boundaries are also indicated
through the commands that forbid humans from having sexual
relationships with animals.

It must be noticed that in each of the forbidding commands above,
there are no natural physical barriers. Thus multiple seeds can
easily be sown together. Human-Animal sexual relationship is
physically possible. God has not created any physical barriers to
prevent these. But perhaps all the results would ultimately be
disastrous. We do not known the full implications, but it is very
clear that what has been forbidden in the Scriptures places certain
moral boundaries around our actions.
