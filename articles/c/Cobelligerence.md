**Co-belligerence**, strictly speaking, is waging a war in
cooperation with another against a common enemy without a formal
alliance. The term co-belligerence indicates remoteness and
differences between the co-belligerent parties although jointly
pursuing a common objective. In Christianity, it refers to an
alliance between denominations, which are normally opposed on
doctrinal grounds, for a common social goal.

According to one author, it can be defined as a cultural philosophy
that warrants questionable alliances in order to make social impact
and change against the moral slippage that plagues our nation --
these alliances created and fostered "on the basis of one thing and
one thing only – the cause at hand."^[[1]](#note-0)^ A case in
point would be conservative evangelicals allying with the Roman
Catholic Church in joint efforts to oppose abortion.
