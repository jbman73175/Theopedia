## Brief biography

Colin Gunton grew up in Nottingham, England. He first studied the
"Greats" (or 'Classics') at Hertford College Oxford and graduated
with a BA in 1966, the same year he was married. He then began his
study of theology, and a year later received an MA from Mansfield
College Oxford. After completing his MA, Gunton began his doctoral
work under the direction of
[Robert Jenson](Robert_Jenson "Robert Jenson"). This degree took
six years, understandably due to the fact that he began teaching
only two years into his doctoral program as he became Lecturer in
Philosophy of Religion at King's College London in 1969. His
dissertation was a study of the [doctrine of God](God "God") in the
thought of Charles Harshorne and
[Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth"), which was completed in 1973.
Gunton later became an Associate Minister of the Brentwood United
Reformed Church in 1975, a position which he held until his
passing.

Gunton was appointed Lecturer in Systematic Theology at Kings
College in 1980, and in 1984 became Professor of Christian
Doctrine, later becoming the Dean of Faculty from 1988-1990. He
also served as Head of the Department of Theology & Religious
Studies from 1993-97. Gunton founded and directed the Research
Institute in Systematic Theology which drew distinguished scholars
and many graduate students from around the world. In 1992 he
delivered the Bampton Lectures at the University of
Oxford^[[1]](#note-0)^ and delivered the Warfield Lectures at
Princeton Theological Seminary in 1993. ^[[2]](#note-1)^ He also
co-founded the
[International Journal of Systematic Theology](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=1463-1652)
with [John Webster](John_Webster "John Webster") and Ralph Del
Colle in 1999.

Gunton was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of London
(1993), the University of Aberdeen (1999), and shortly before his
death, the University of Oxford (2003). He was also made a Fellow
of King's College. ^[[3]](#note-2)^

## Writings

It has been said that "it is difficult to over-estimate the
importance of [Gunton's] contribution to English Theology over the
past 25 years. He has published a dozen sole author books and
edited and contributed to a further half dozen." ^[[4]](#note-3)^
Gunton's most influential work was on the
[doctrines](Doctrine "Doctrine") of [Creation](Creation "Creation")
and the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity").

"Gunton's books have been influential internationally. Perhaps his
most important book is *The One, the Three and the Many* (1993).
One article in this book, 'God, Creation and the Culture of
Modernity', is a profound analysis of the paradoxes and
contradictions of [Modernity](Modernism "Modernism"). This book is
a majestical survey of the western intellectual tradition and a
penetrating analysis of the modern condition." ^[[5]](#note-4)^
