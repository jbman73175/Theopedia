## Greeting (1-2)

These verses are a string of incomplete sentences designed to
introduce the writer and the recipients of the book as well as to
establish their common ground in the faith. The section is designed
to be compact and concise. Several different theological points can
be derived from the text:

-   [Ecclesiology](Ecclesiology "Ecclesiology"): the nature of New
    Testament [apostleship](Apostle "Apostle") (Col. 1:1).
-   [Theology Proper](God "God"): the sovereign nature of God (Col.
    1:1).
-   [Soteriology](Soteriology "Soteriology"): the brotherhood of
    believers and their [adoption](Adoption "Adoption") into God’s
    family (Col. 1:1-2).
-   [Soteriology](Soteriology "Soteriology"): the nature of
    sanctification at salvation (Col. 1:2).
-   [Soteriology](Soteriology "Soteriology")/[Christology](Christology "Christology"):
    the believer’s union with Christ (Col. 1:2).
-   [Theology Proper](God "God"): the gifts of God (Col. 1:2).

### Verse 1

*Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,*
(ESV)

#### Summary

This verse identifies the writer and the senders of the letter
being written and puts forth their credentials for doing so.
[Paul](Paul "Paul") is identified as an apostle, suited to instruct
the Colossian believers in writing; Timothy is identified as a
mutual brother, suitable for fellowship in ministry.

#### Context

**Historical:** [Paul](Paul "Paul") served as an “authorized
spokesperson” (Vaughan, 172) of
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") throughout the Roman
Empire. Timothy was his companion and, to a certain extent, his
successor in
ministry^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^.

**Grammatical** The first two verses serve in a similar function as
a label on a gift today. Neither verse one or verse two is designed
to be a complete sentence in the original language, but rather
something like “**From:** Paul…and Timothy” and “**To:** the
saints…at Colossae.”

#### Details

**Grammar**

-   [Apostle](Apostle "Apostle") (Gk. *apostolos*): The term is
    used here substantively to indicate a “sent one” or messenger. The
    term can be used to designate the office of an
    [apostle](Apostle "Apostle") (one who had seen
    [Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") in the flesh and was
    commissioned by Him) or the character of an individual (one who
    goes forth with a message about
    [Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ")).
-   [Will](Will_of_God "Will of God") (Gk. *thelema*): The word
    functions as the object of the preposition “by” (Gk. *dia* -
    indicates cause). The term has a broad range of meaning and can
    describe anything from a simple wish to a determining will. In this
    case the word legitimately shows how the desires of
    [God](God "God") become reality in the life of a believer who walks
    in the [Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit"). Also note that the
    willing to become an [apostle](Apostle "Apostle") finds its source
    not in the apostle himself, but in the [God](God "God") Who made
    him to be an apostle. Furthermore, [Paul](Paul "Paul") lived every
    moment with the realization that God designed him for the
    [Gospel](Gospel "Gospel") ministry (Acts 9:15); in fact, this
    phrase (“through/by the will of God”) is distinctly Pauline (cf.
    Rom. 15:32; I Cor. 1:1; II Cor. 1:1; 8:5; Eph. 1:1; II Tim. 1:1).
-   Brother (Gk. *adelphos*): This word is a simple modifier for
    the word “Timothy” and is used here figuratively to indicate the
    brotherhood and special relationship that all believers experience
    in [Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") (Col. 2:2a). Such a
    position is given to the believer through adoption and brings
    access to an inheritance (Col. 1:12). Probably the best opposing
    concept to this is the term “sons of disobedience” (Col. 3:6 -
    [NASB](NASB "NASB")/[NKJV](NKJV "NKJV")), which indicates a
    closeness of unbelievers around their unifying distinctive, namely,
    disobedience.

#### Structure

The incomplete nature of this sentence has led some
([NLT](New_Living_Translation "New Living Translation"),
[The Message](The_Message "The Message")) to insert either a
parenthetical “This letter is from…”
([NLT](New_Living_Translation "New Living Translation")) before the
verse or some form of a parenthetical verb of being after the name
of [Paul](Paul "Paul") “Paul who is…” These suggestions, though
helpful for modern readers, miss the point that this verse is
written in a simplistic form in order to spend the most amount of
time writing about what mattered to him.

Structurally, the verse opens with the prime subject, “Paul.” The
next term, “apostle,” merely renames the previous term and,
therefore, functions substantively. The phrase, “of Christ,” comes
from a single word in the [Greek](Greek "Greek") and is a
subjective genitive. In other words, the word “Christ” could
function as the subject of a verb form of “apostle” and such a
construction emphasizes Christ as the source of Paul’s
[apostleship](Apostle "Apostle"). The name “Jesus” is another
genitive, but it functions much like the term “apostle” does and
simply modifies or renames “Christ” substantively. The preposition
“by” (Gk. *dia*) indicates that the means by which Paul became an
apostle was through the sovereign direction of [God](God "God").
“Will” is the genitive object of the preposition “by,” and “of God”
is another subjective genitive, which, like the phrase “of Christ,”
modifies the term “will” in such a way as to indicate that
[God](God "God") is the one who is willing and leading so that
[Jesus](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") made an
[apostle](Apostle "Apostle") out of [Paul](Paul "Paul"). The
conjunction “and” functions to connect the two phrases together in
coordination. Such a structure indicates that [Paul](Paul "Paul")
viewed Timothy as a peer even though the term “apostle” showed
that, in [God’s](God "God") eyes, Paul was in a more prominent role
than Timothy. This equal coordination of men on the human plane is
proven by the final phrase of the verse. “Timothy” is renamed
(substantively modified just as “Paul” with “apostle” and “Christ”
with “Jesus”) by the term “brother.” The word “our” before actually
comes from a definite article in the [Greek](Greek "Greek"),
normally translated as “the,” but, in the current verse, the
context would indicate that the article is being used pronominally
and should be translated as “our.”

#### Difficulties

-   Did [Paul](Paul "Paul") really write Colossians (“Paul”)? The
    “minority” (Kent, 4) of scholars who question [Paul’s](Paul "Paul")
    authorship of the book do so on the grounds that **(1)** the heresy
    in Colossians must be [Gnosticism](Gnosticism "Gnosticism") and
    therefore the book could not have been written before the second
    century, and **(2)** the vocabulary and style in the book appear to
    be inconsistent with other Pauline works
    ([Bruce](F._F._Bruce "F. F. Bruce"), 28-29). To the first argument,
    it should be noted that the heresy is not full-blown
    [Gnosticism](Gnosticism "Gnosticism"), but rather an incipient form
    of [Gnosticism](Gnosticism "Gnosticism") which involved a large
    variety of Jewish and pagan beliefs. To the second argument, it is
    important to note that limiting [Paul](Paul "Paul") to a single
    style or set of words is an absurd notion. The cunning of a writer
    is shown in his ability to adapt his writing to occasion and to the
    recipients. In the case of this book, the Colossian believers are
    struggling with a heresy that appears to have used certain
    catchwords as key teachings for their beliefs; [Paul](Paul "Paul")
    uses or modifies these words in order to combat the heresy at hand.
    In other words, due to the false doctrines at hand,
    [Paul](Paul "Paul") uses unique vocabulary to establish the
    superiority of [Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"). On the other
    hand, the grammatical style is very Pauline. Long sentences, like
    the ones here in Colossians (Col. 1:3-8, Col. 1:9-20 -
    [Greek](Greek "Greek") Text), made from strings of independent
    clauses typify many of Paul’s letters (Kent, 4). Furthermore,
    Pauline authorship is implicit within the text. [Paul](Paul "Paul")
    names himself as the author of the letter in Col. 1:1, Col. 1:23,
    and Col. 4:18. No effective argument has been made to show that
    using the name of a popular writer in order to forge a book in his
    name was a practice either practically common or ethically accepted
    in the first century. Ethically, for someone to forge an author’s
    name and signature would be a falsehood, something uncharacteristic
    of admonitions contained within the book such as “do not lie one to
    another” (Col. 3:9 - [ESV](ESV "ESV")). Next, the book has been
    unquestionably ascribed to the [[Paul|Apostle Paul] until questions
    were raised in the nineteenth century. Early church fathers such as
    [Ignatius of Antioch](Ignatius_of_Antioch "Ignatius of Antioch"),
    [Polycarp](Polycarp "Polycarp"), and
    [Justin Martyr](Justin_Martyr "Justin Martyr") appear to make first
    century allusions to the book, and [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus")
    makes the first explicit declaration of Pauline authorship during
    the early second century. Finally, the book’s credibility is
    established through the unquestioned authenticity of the book of
    [Philemon](Epistle_to_Philemon "Epistle to Philemon"). The
    connection of places and names between the two books links them to
    each other, and the credibility of
    [Philemon](Epistle_to_Philemon "Epistle to Philemon") proves that
    Colossians is, in fact, just as genuine.
-   Did Timothy co-author Colossians (“and Timothy”)?
    [F. F. Bruce](F._F._Bruce "F. F. Bruce") states that “Timothy to
    some extent shares the responsibility of authorship with Paul” (41)
    on the grounds of Timothy’s inclusion with [Paul](Paul "Paul") in
    this introductory verse, the “we” passages in the book (Col. 1:3,
    Col. 1:4, Col. 1:9), and a supposed equivalent in I and II
    Thessalonians (Silvanus is suggested to co-author those books with
    Paul due to the use of the some plural pronouns there as well). On
    the other hand, most conservatives hold that [Paul](Paul "Paul")
    was the sole author of the book and that Timothy is mentioned here
    only “as a matter of courtesy” (Vaughan, 172) due to his extensive
    association with the [apostle](Apostle "Apostle"). In defense of
    this argument, it is pointed out that the plural form found in the
    introduction (Col. 1:1-9) is “dropped” (Kent, 19) in favor of the
    ordinary singular form found throughout the rest of the book (Col.
    1:24, Col. 1:25, Col. 1:29; Col. 2:1-5; Col. 4:7-18).

#### Textual

-   Omission/Addition: The phrase “Jesus Christ/Christ Jesus” is
    shortened to “Jesus” in a few older texts among the Alexandrian
    family. All modern critical texts and versions include the longer
    reading because of its strong textual support among the
    overwhelming majority of texts from all periods.
-   Word Reversal: The phrase “Jesus Christ” is found in the large
    majority of extant texts and is supported by the [KJV](KJV "KJV"),
    [NKJV](NKJV "NKJV"), [NASB](NASB "NASB"). The opposite, “Christ
    Jesus” is found in a few old texts in the Alexandrian family and is
    followed by the [ESV](ESV "ESV"), [NIV](NIV "NIV"), AMP, and the
    [Greek](Greek "Greek") NA27.

### Verse 2

*To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.*
([ESV](ESV "ESV"))

#### Summary

This verse identifies the recipients of the letter as the believers
who lived in the city of Colossae. Secondarily, [Paul](Paul "Paul")
extends a greeting to these believers in the form of a prayer to
[God](God "God") for an extra measure of [grace](Grace "Grace") and
peace for the Colossian believers to meet their spiritual needs.

#### Context

**Historical:** Colossae was a city that [Paul](Paul "Paul") had
never visited (Col. 2:1).

**Grammatical:** The first two verses serve in a similar function
as a label on a gift today. Neither verse one or verse two is
designed to be a complete sentence in the original language, but
rather something like “**From:** Paul…and Timothy” and “**To:** the
saints…at Colossae.” The phrase “Grace to you and peace from God
our Father” has no stated verb and functions both as a brief
salutation and a prayer.

#### Details

**Grammar:**

-   [Saints](Saint "Saint") (Gk. *hagioi*): The plural form of the
    adjective “holy” is used substantively in the phrase. The word is
    connected with the phrase "faithful brothers" denoting that the
    saints are the faithful brothers. The word essentially refers to an
    object that is sanctified (i.e. set apart) and pure for the use of
    [God](God "God").
-   Faithful (Gk. *pistois*): This adjective directly modifies the
    word “brothers” and is used to characterize them. In other words,
    the Colossian believers were not just [saints](Saint "Saint") and
    brothers, but they were saints and faithful brothers. Faithfulness,
    therefore, is a necessity of a true [saint](Saint "Saint").
    Faithfulness is a much stronger idea to the [Greek](Greek "Greek")
    speaker than to the English speaker. Often the English speaker is
    able to separate faithfulness from faith, but the
    [Greek](Greek "Greek") speaker did not make such distinctions (e.g.
    Heb. 11:11 – “faith” is tied with “faithful”). In fact, the word
    may hearken back to its intended meaning if the word “trustworthy”
    were used instead (brothers who are worthy of trust = faithful
    brothers). The rest of the introduction intends to explain the
    faithfulness of the Colossian believers to be stewards over their
    trust.
-   [Grace](Grace "Grace") (Gk. *charis*): Acting as a subject of
    an elliptical verb (hence the implied “be” in most translations),
    this word functions in direct connection with the word “peace” to
    denote a granting, giving, or imparting of a gift. Although a
    similar word (Gk. *charein*) was commonly used as a
    [Greek](Greek "Greek") salutation, [the Apostle](Paul "Paul"), no
    doubt, used the word grace in a theological sense as well as a
    substitute for the common word used to greet others. To the first
    century [Christian](Christian "Christian"), certain terms which had
    merely common meanings took on new significance after
    [salvation](Salvation "Salvation"). What was used as a human
    greeting for a sign of goodwill was used by [God’s](God "God")
    messengers in the divine message of grace to the human race. The
    unmerited favor of [God](God "God") rang in the mind of the
    [Greek](Greek "Greek") believer daily. The understanding gained by
    the Greek-speaker has been lost by the English-speaker; certain
    words such as goodbye (a gradually shortened form of “God bless
    ye”) have completely lost any connection to their divine roots and
    have taken on a merely secular meaning.
-   Peace (Gk. *eirene*/Heb. *shalom*): Although the
    [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") was not written in
    [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew"), the [Greek](Greek "Greek") word for
    “peace” was most likely being used in the place of the
    [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew") word for greeting. Once again,
    [Paul](Paul "Paul") amplifies the term from the common usage and
    emphasizes the spiritual reality of the word.

#### Structure

Just as with verse one, some versions
([NLT](New_Living_Translation "New Living Translation"),
[The Message](The_Message "The Message")) attempt to turn the first
section of this verse into a complete sentence. These suggestions,
though helpful for modern readers, miss the point that this verse
is written in a simplistic form in order to spend the most amount
of time writing about what mattered to him. The second section of
the verse is quite possibly a sentence with an elliptical verb of
being (i.e. “[May] grace and peace [be/be given] to you…”). Once
again, it is important to note that the brevity of the verse was
very important to [Paul](Paul "Paul"). Adding too much detail to
the verse may, in fact, avoid serving the purpose of the writer.

Structurally, this verse opens with its joint subjects “saints” and
“brothers.” The words all occur in the dative case, often referred
to as the epistolary dative due to its common use at the opening of
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") epistles. Both terms
are coordinated as equals by the conjunction “and” (Gk. *kai*). The
term “brothers” is modified by the adjective “faithful.” Both
“saints” and “brothers” are modified by two parallel prepositional
phrases. The first prepositional phrase is “in Christ” (Gk.
*en Xristo*) and is used in a locative sense (believers are located
spiritually in Christ). The second prepositional phrase “at
Colossae” (Gk. *en Kolossais*) is also used in a literal locative
sense (the believers being spoken to were living in the city of
Colossae). Although many English translations use two different
propositions for the two phrases, the [Greek](Greek "Greek")
utilizes the same preposition. The connection is of some importance
to the expositor, because the believer is as much a citizen of his
respective country/city as he is a part of
[Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"). Next, [Paul](Paul "Paul")
greets his readers with a prayer. This prayer has two subjects
(“Grace” and “peace”) of an elliptical “be” verb connected to a
dative form of the personal pronoun “you.” The use of the dative
appears to be personal advantage (i.e. “Grace and peace [for your
benefit]). The prayer is closed with a prepositional phrase (“from
God” – Gk. *apo Theou*) which indicates that God is the origin of
both grace and peace. The word “Father” renames the word “God” in
the phrase. In an extended reading of the text (see textual notes
below), a coordinating conjunction (Gk. *kai*) connects “the Lord
Jesus Christ” to “God the Father,” indicating that
[Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") is also the source of
[grace](Grace "Grace") and peace for believers. The words “Jesus”
and “Christ” stand in apposition to the term “Lord” and serve to
rename it.

#### Difficulties

-   Are the “saints” and “faithful brothers” two separate groups?
    No, they are coordinated by the word “and” (Gk. *kai*) and are all
    in the same gender, number, and case in [Greek](Greek "Greek").
-   Can the word “saints” be translated simply as “holy”? The NIV
    uses the term “holy” while all other major versions use the term
    “saints.” The issue at hand is this; does the grammar and the
    context of the word indicate that it should be translated as an
    adjective (“holy”) which modifies the term brothers or as a noun
    (“saints”) which is equivalent to the phrase “faithful brothers.
    The word could be translated either way grammatically, but should
    be translated “saints” due to the context of the verse. The
    literary context demands it because the term must be translated as
    “saints” in other book introductions (II Cor. 1:1; Eph. 1:1; Phil.
    1:1). The book context demands the translation “saints” because the
    occurrence of the same word in Col. 1:4 must be translated as
    “saints.” Vaughan, however, follows the translation “holy” because
    it “is truer to the Greek in retaining the adjectival force” (172).
-   Can the word “faithful” be translated here as “believing”?
    Although the adjective “faithful” could be translated “believing”
    grammatically, but should not be translated as such due to the
    context of the verse. Although the Amplified Bible attempts to
    grasp the entirety of the spectrum of the word’s meaning, it fails
    to take into consideration that such a reading adds nothing to the
    verse ([Bruce](F._F._Bruce "F. F. Bruce"), 39). In favor of the
    broader sense of “faithful,” such a meaning is clearly reflected in
    other occurrences throughout the book (Col. 1:7; 4:7, 9).

#### Textual

-   Spelling: Two [Greek](Greek "Greek") spellings for the same
    word (“at Colossae”) appear in the different text streams. No
    difference appears in the English text and no significance is found
    in the doctrine. In fact, this is one of the instances that create
    an artificially high number of differences between the
    [Greek](Greek "Greek") texts.
    [Those who intend to create skepticism about the strength of the extant manuscripts](King_James_Only_movement "King James Only movement")
    use these figures to help their arguments, while, in reality, many
    of the differences remain completely unknown to the English reader.
-   Omission/Addition: The Alexandrian texts read: “from God our
    Father.” The Byzantine texts continue the phrase to read: “and
    [the] Lord Jesus Christ.” This second phrase is usually written off
    by many current textual critics as spurious because of its
    similarities to Rom 1:7 and other Pauline introductions and because
    some of the older texts do not include the phrase.
    [F. F. Bruce](F._F._Bruce "F. F. Bruce") sees the dissimilarity
    from most of [Paul’s](Paul "Paul") epistles as “difficult” in light
    of the highly [Christological](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") nature
    of the book, but concedes that the “uniqueness of this reading
    speaks in its favor.” Such argumentation led the UBS4
    [Greek](Greek "Greek") text to rank the omission of the phrase with
    a confidence level of A, that of complete certainty; however, the
    TR and the Majority texts follow a broad base of texts (including
    4th century Aleph and 5th century A) in including the phrase. Solid
    textual support exists on both sides of this argument, but English
    Bibles tend to exclude the phrase ([ESV](ESV "ESV"),
    [NIV](NIV "NIV"), [NASB](NASB "NASB"), Amplified Bible). Only the
    [KJV](KJV "KJV") and [NKJV](NKJV "NKJV") include the phrase.

### The firstborn of all creation

*"Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature...*"

Many non-Christians [[1]](http://www.carm.org/jw/col1_15.htm) argue
that verse 15 denies the deity of Christ, on the premise that
firstborn means "first thing created" or "the one created to create
everything else"
[[2]](http://www.comereason.org/bibl_cntr/con072.asp). Many
Christians reply that *prototokos* (firstborn) essentially refers
to Christ's preeminence, not the time of His creation in the
created order.

> "The point, then, is not that Christ is the first creature. This
> would demand a stress on the -tokos and would also bring birth into
> conflict with creation. What is stated is Christ's supremacy over
> creation as its mediator." -Kittle's Theological Dictionary of the
> New Testament (Eerdmans, 1985)

personal presentation of them to you in my own afflictions and
pain, I rejoice." (John Piper)
