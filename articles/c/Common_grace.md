**Common Grace** refers to the [grace](Grace "Grace") of
[God](God "God") that is common to all humankind. It is "common"
because its benefits are experienced by the whole human race
without distinction between one person and another, believers or
unbelievers. It is "grace" because it is undeserved and sovereignly
bestowed by God. In this sense, it is distinguished from the
Calvinistic understanding of "special" or "saving" grace, which
extends only to those whom God has chosen to redeem.

## Aspects of common grace

In the words of [Reformed](Calvinism "Calvinism") scholar
[Louis Berkhof](Louis_Berkhof "Louis Berkhof"), “[Common grace]
curbs the destructive power of sin, maintains in a measure the
moral order of the universe, thus making an orderly life possible,
distributes in varying degrees gifts and talents among men,
promotes the development of science and art, and showers untold
blessings upon the children of men.”^[[1]](#note-0)^ The various
aspects of God's common grace to all mankind may be generally
gathered under three heads:

### Providential care in creation

God’s sustaining care for his creation, called divine providence,
is grace common to all. The Bible says, for instance, that God
through the Son "upholds the universe by the word of his power"
(Heb. 1:2-3; John 1:1-4). God's gracious provision for his
creatures is seen in the giving of the seasons, of seedtime and
harvest. It is of this providential common grace that Jesus reminds
his hearers when he said God "makes his sun rise on the evil and on
the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust" (Matt.
5:45). We also see evidence of God’s common grace in the
establishment of various structures within human society. At a
foundational level, God has ordained the family unit. Even pagan
parents typically know that they should nurture their children
(Matt. 7:9-10) and raise them to become responsible adults.

### Providential restraint of sin

In the Bible, Paul teaches that *civil authorities* have been
"instituted by God" (Rom. 13:1) to maintain order and punish
wrong-doing. Although fallible instruments of his common grace,
civil governments are called "ministers of God" (Rom. 13:6) that
should not be feared by those who do good. God also sovereignly
works through circumstances to limit a persons sinful behavior
(Gen. 20:6, 1 Sam. 25:26).

### In man's conscience

The apostle Paul says that when unbelieving Gentiles "who do not
have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to
themselves, . . . They show that the work of the law is written on
their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their
conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them" (Rom. 2:14-15,
ESV). By God's common grace fallen mankind retains a conscience
indicating the differences between right and wrong. This may be
based on the fact that human beings, though fallen in sin, retain a
semblance of the "image of God" with which they were originally
created (Gen. 9:6: 1 Cor. 11:7).

In summary, common grace is seen in God's continuing care for his
creation, his restraining human society from becoming altogether
intolerable and ungovernable, his making it possible for mankind to
live together in a generally orderly and cooperative manner, and
maintaining man's conscious sense of basic right and wrong
behavior.

## Contrasted with special grace

Special grace, in
[Reformed theology](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology"), is the
grace by which God redeems, sanctifies, and glorifies his people.
Unlike common grace, which is universally given, special grace is
bestowed only on those whom God elects to eternal life through
faith in Jesus Christ. This special grace is often linked with the
[Five points of Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") as
[Irresistible grace](Irresistible_grace "Irresistible grace") or
Efficacious grace.

## Theological Issues

### Within Calvinism

The specifics of the Reformed doctrine of common grace have been
somewhat controversial and at times bitterly contested by some
Calvinists. Especially in the Dutch tradition, it has been the
cause of divisions. For example, in a 1924 Synod of the
[Christian Reformed Church](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Reformed_Church "wikipedia:Christian Reformed Church")
(CRC), the CRC adopted what became known as the "Three Points of
Common Grace."^[[2]](#note-1)^ Certain ministers within the CRC
refused to subscribe to those "Three Points," and they (with the
majority of their consistories) were either suspended or deposed
from office. Thus began the
[Protestant Reformed Churches](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformed_Church "wikipedia:Protestant Reformed Church")
in America. These ministers, and others after them, wrote responses
to the decision that was taken and ever since, the Protestant
Reformed Churches have maintained that these "Three Points" were
contrary to Scripture and the Reformed
Confessions.^[[3]](#note-2)^

### Between Calvinism and Arminianism

Both Calvinists and Arminians generally accept the concept of
common grace in the sense of undeserved blessings which God may
extend to all mankind. However, the Arminian sees this common grace
including what has been termed "common sufficient grace" or the
Wesleyan
"[universal prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace")"
whereby the effects of [the fall](Original_sin "Original sin") are
offset such that all persons now have free will and the moral
ability to understand spiritual things and turn to God in Christ
for salvation. The Calvinist maintains that God's common grace does
not improve man's [depraved](Total_depravity "Total depravity")
unregenerate nature, is exclusive of changing a person's heart, and
separate from his salvific purposes.

## Quotes

-   "The Bible therefore teaches that the Holy Spirit as the Spirit
    of truth, of holiness, and of life in all its forms, is present
    with every human mind, enforcing truth, restraining from evil,
    exciting to good, and imparting wisdom or strength, when, where,
    and in what measure seemeth to Him good." -
    [Charles Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge"),
    *Systematic Theology*
-   "The word 'common' in the title of the topic is not used in the
    sense that each particular favour is given to all without
    discrimination or distinction but rather in the sense that favours
    of varying kinds and degrees are bestowed upon this sin-cursed
    world, favours real in their character as expressions of the divine
    goodness but which are not in themselves and of themselves saving
    in their nature and effect. So the term 'common grace' should
    rather be defined as every favour of whatever kind or degree,
    falling short of salvation, which this undeserving and sin-cursed
    world enjoys at the hand of God." -
    [John Murray](John_Murray "John Murray"), *Common Grace*
-   "There are in the souls of wicked men those hellish principles
    reigning, that would presently kindle and flame out into hell-fire,
    if it were not for God's restraints. There is laid in the very
    nature of carnal men, a foundation for the torments of hell: there
    are those corrupt principles, in reigning power in them, and in
    full possession of them, that are the beginnings of hell-fire.
    These principles are active and powerful, exceeding violent in
    their nature, and if it were not for the restraining hand of God
    upon them, they would soon break out, they would flame out after
    the same manner as the same corruptions, the same enmity does in
    the hearts of damned souls, and would beget the same torments in
    them as they do in them. The souls of the wicked are in Scripture
    compared to the troubled sea, Isaiah 57:20. For the present God
    restrains their wickedness by his mighty power, as he does the
    raging waves of the troubled sea, saying, ‘Hitherto shalt thou
    come, and no further;’ but if God should withdraw that restraining
    power, it would soon carry all before it. Sin is the ruin and
    misery of the soul; it is destructive in its nature; and if God
    should leave it without restraint, there would need nothing else to
    make the soul perfectly miserable. The corruption of the heart of
    man is a thing that is immoderate and boundless in its fury; and
    while wicked men live here, it is like fire pent up by God's
    restraints, whereas if it were let loose, it would set on fire the
    course of nature; and as the heart is now a sink of sin, so, if sin
    was not restrained, it would immediately turn the soul into a fiery
    oven, or a furnace of fire and brimstone." -
    [Jonathan Edwards](Jonathan_Edwards "Jonathan Edwards"), "Sinners
    in the Hands of an Angry God"
