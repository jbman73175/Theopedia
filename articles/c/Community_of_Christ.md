**Community of Christ**, previously known as the
**Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints** or RLDS
church is a branch of Mormon Restorationism, and is the second
largest denomination of the Latter Day Saint movement. Based in
Independence, Missouri, the faith shares its origins with
[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints")
(the LDS or Mormon Church), but does not use the term Mormon in
self-reference.

## Overview

The history of the two largest Latter Day Saint denominations began
to diverge with the martyrdom of the movement's founder, Joseph
Smith Jr. on June 27, 1844 in Carthage, Illinois. Historians
sometimes refer to the Midwestern branch of the movement as the
Prairie Saints and the Western (or Utah) branch as the Rocky
Mountain Saints.

Community of Christ today has approximately 250,000 members in 50
countries. The church owns two temples, the original Latter Day
Saint temple in Kirtland, Ohio (operated in part as a historic site
as part of its educational ministry), and the relatively new temple
which serves as the church's headquarters in Independence. The
church operates Graceland University with campuses in Lamoni, Iowa
and Independence. The church also owns and operates Latter Day
Saint historic sites in Far West Mo., Lamoni, Plano, and Nauvoo,
Illinois.

Community of Christ is led by a First Presidency, consisting of a
Prophet-President and two counselors. The church's ministry is
overseen by a Council of Twelve Apostles and the temporal needs of
the church are overseen by the Presiding Bishopric. Meeting
together, these quorums are known as the Joint Council. Every two
years, delegates from around the world meet together to vote on
church business in World Conference.

Within the past several decades, the church has seemed by many to
be moving in the direction of greater tolerance, emphasizing its
role as a "Peace and Justice Church." Some changes have occurred
including the ordination of women to the priesthood, and the
changing of the church's name. Some of these changes are percieved
as a departure from the teachings of the scriptures, causing some
members to question weather these changes are in accordance with
God's will. This has resulted in the formation of offshoot
organizations or independent branches similar in many ways to the
early history of Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints. (See RLDS Restoration Branches ).

## Major doctrines

Those of the Community of Christ have been called "moderate
Mormons" and Joseph Smith III's biographer referred to the first
president of the Reorganization as a "pragmatic prophet." In this
way, the Latter Day Saintism of the Prairie Saints has sometimes
been seen as a bridge between the beliefs of their Rocky Mountain
Saint cousins and those of mainstream Christianity.

In contrast to the [Mormons](Mormonism "Mormonism") in the LDS
tradition whose cosmology includes a Godhead of three "distinct
gods" progressing according to a "Plan of Salvation," Latter Day
Saints of the Reorganization accept the doctrine of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity").

Temple practices between the two largest Latter Day Saint
denominations also differ. The Independence and Kirtland Temples
are places of education and worship for all people. In keeping with
the Community of Christ's role as a "peace and justice church," the
Independence temple was explicitly dedicated to the concept of
"peace." Each day of the year at 12:30 pm local Central Standard
Time/Central Daylight Savings Time a prayer for peace is held in
the sanctuary of the Independence Temple.

### Scripture

The Community of Christ considers the Bible, the Book of Mormon and
the Book of Doctrine and Covenants to be scripture.

**Bible**

In his lifetime, Joseph Smith, Jr. began a project to
"re-translate" or revise the
[King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version") of
the [Bible](Bible "Bible"). Upon his death, the working manuscript
was retained in Smith's family and came into the possession of the
Community of Christ. The work was edited and is published by the
church as the "Inspired Version" of the Bible. (see Joseph Smith
Translation of the Bible.) Members of the Community of Christ also
accept and make use of other more recent translations of the Bible.
**Book of Mormon**

Community of Christ publishes two versions of the
[Book of Mormon](Book_of_Mormon "Book of Mormon"). The Authorized
Edition is based on the original printer's manuscript and the 1837
Second Edition (or Kirtland Edition) of the Book of Mormon. Its
content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the versification is
different. Community of Christ also publishes a Revised Authorized
Edition which attempts to modernize some of the book's language.
**Book of Doctrine and Covenants**

This continually growing and evolving work of scripture contains
select revelation and other documents primarily given through the
prophet-presidents of Community of Christ. This edition varies
significantly from the current LDS edition and both are much
expanded from the original 1835 edition. In contrast to the general
post-1844 practice of the LDS church, Community of Christ continues
to add revelations given by its prophet-presidents. Former
President W. Grant McMurray presented the most recent revelation to
the church, which was accepted as Section 162, on 31 March 2004.
