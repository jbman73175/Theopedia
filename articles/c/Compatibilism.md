**Compatibilism**, sometimes called **soft determinism**, is a
theological term that deals with the topics of
[free will](Free_will "Free will") and
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination"). It seeks to show
that God's exhaustive
[sovereignty](Sovereignty_of_God "Sovereignty of God") is
compatible with human freedom, or in other words, it claims that
[determinism](index.php?title=Determinism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Determinism (page does not exist)")
and [free will](Free_will "Free will") are compatible. Rather than
limit the exercise of God's sovereignty in order to preserve man's
freedom, compatibilists say that there must be a different way to
define what freedom really means.

## Basic beliefs

Compatibilism, in contrast to
[Libertarian free will](Libertarian_free_will "Libertarian free will"),
teaches that people *are* free, but defines freedom differently.
Compatibilism claims that every person chooses according to his or
her greatest desire. In other words, people will always choose what
they want-- and what they want is determined by (and consistent
with) their moral [nature](Nature "Nature"). Man freely makes
choices, but those choices are determined by the condition of his
heart and mind (i.e. his moral nature). Libertarian free will
maintains that for any choice made, one could always equally have
chosen otherwise, or not chosen at all.

## God's involvement

God is said to influence our desires, and thus is able to have
exhaustive control of all that goes on.

## Moral responsibility

In general, people agree that the one with uncaused action is held
responsible for an action. Not the ball that was caused to roll,
but the person who was not caused to push is held responsible for
the rolling of the ball. However, according to this worldview, the
same does not apply to humans. Although a man is considered unable
to choose against his desires, which are caused by his sin nature
or God's intervention, the moral responsibility of sin lies with
him. He chose to do it, therefore he is held responsible. Not what
caused him to choose, but he that chooses is held responsible.

This understanding of moral responsibility absolves God of
authorship of sin; man, as caused by fall, is naturally "inclined
to all evil" (Heidelberg Catechism, Q.7). Whether God decrees the
fall of man or not, God is not thought to force this evil
inclination upon man; but rather, He "gave [man] over to a depraved
mind, to do those things which are not proper" (Rom. 1:28; NASB).
God "gave over" men who "suppress the truth in unrighteousness . .
. For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God"
(Rom. 1:18, 21). The evil nature of man was not created or caused
by God, but is a corruption of God's good creation (cf. Gen. 1:31).
The Biblical doctrine of reprobation teaches that the sinful man is
condemned apart from God's saving grace. Scripture uses the phrase
"gave over" to describe God's allowance of reprobation (rf. Rom.
1:24, 26; NASB). God allows, but is not the primary cause of, sin.
The Westminster Confession of Faith teaches that God's will is
necessarily efficacious, but is effected by means of "secondary
causes" subject to His sovereign control.^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Scriptural support

-   Matthew 7:15-20

In this passage, [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") states that *healthy* trees
cannot produce *diseased* fruit. They will choose and produce
according to what they are (their [nature](Nature "Nature")). Thus,
if we are still in our sins we will choose and produce bad fruit
accordingly. The same is with those who produce good fruit.

-   John 8:34
-   Romans 8:7
-   1 Corinthians 2:14

## Argument(s) against libertarian freedom

Compatibilists argue that if all of our choices are uncaused, they
would then be completely arbitrary, unpredictable, and not really
moral actions at all.
