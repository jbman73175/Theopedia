***Note:***
*It is recommended that before reading this article to be somewhat familiar with the following views / articles: [Molinism](Molinism "Molinism"), [compatibilism](Compatibilism "Compatibilism"), and [libertarian freedom](Libertarian_freedom "Libertarian freedom")*


* * * * *

**Compatibilist middle knowledge** is a theological view that
combines the understandings of
[middle knowledge](Middle_knowledge "Middle knowledge") and a
[compatibilist](Compatibilism "Compatibilism") understanding of
[divine providence](Providence_of_God "Providence of God") to form
a coherent view of
[God's sovereignty](Sovereignty_of_God "Sovereignty of God") and
[human freedom](Free_will "Free will"). This view is argued for by
[Bruce Ware](Bruce_Ware "Bruce Ware") in his book,
*God's Greater Glory*.

## Middle knowledge without libertarian freedom

According to middle knowledge, God can envision a person in any set
of circumstances and know what they would choose in any and each
instance. The problem with traditional
[Molinism](Molinism "Molinism") (the name sometimes used to
describe the middle knowledge view) is the connection of
[libertarian freedom](Libertarian_freedom "Libertarian freedom")
with
[God's foreknowledge](Foreknowledge_of_God "Foreknowledge of God").
The result is that God could not exhaustively know a person's free
actions by simply knowing their circumstances. In other words, if
they *do* in fact possess libertarian freedom, he cannot know for
certain what a free agent will actually choose, for according to
libertarian freedom, they *could have chosen otherwise*.

It should be noted, however, that the great majority of proponents
of Libertarian Freedom, and the great majority of proponents of
Middle Knowledge, do not agree with Ware's contention that God
cannot know counterfactuals of creaturely freedom if Libertarian
Freedom is true.

## How compatibilism helps

A compatibilist view combined with the tenets of middle knowledge
are said to strengthen Molinism's claims. This is possible because
if humanity does possess compatibilist freedom this allows God to
exhaustively know what they would do in each circumstance, because
according to compatibilist freedom, the person will choose their
greatest desire.

When a person is placed in specific circumstances, these
circumstances tend to affect and influence what a person will
choose. Therefore, if God, through his middle knowledge, can know
the circumstances each person will encounter, he can also know the
choices that each person would make in each circumstance.

## Biblical support

-   Exodus 13:17
-   1 Sam. 23:8-14
-   Jeremiah 23:21-22
-   Matt. 11:21-24
-   1 Cor. 2:8

[Bruce Ware](Bruce_Ware "Bruce Ware") particularly notes the
relationship of 1 Corinthians 2:8 and Acts 4:27-28 regarding God's
predestined plans. He argues that the past fulfillment of what
"God's plan had predestined to take place" involved God's middle
knowledge of what the "rulers of this age" should know or not know.
God knew what the rulers would do with knowledge of God's wisdom in
Christ, and he knew what they would do without it. He thus chose to
form the circumstances where they would *not* know and would
therefore choose to crucify Jesus (Ware, p. 119).

## Compatibilist middle knowledge and evil

To be coherent (and biblical), compatibilist middle knowledge must
show that God is not the direct cause of evil. Ware begins his
argument by affirming biblically that God controls both good and
evil (Isaiah 45:7) and that God is good and not evil (Psalms 5:4).
Yet, by using his middle knowledge, God can control specific
situations and ultimately the outcome of each persons choices. For
if one person will choose to do "option A" according to his
greatest desire, if God changes the circumstances even slightly,
God can know (and be assured) that he would then choose "option B"
instead of "option A". And so, "God, through his middle knowledge,
can know whether he should permit an agent to choose according to
his greatest desire or whether to alter the circumstances" (Ware,
p. 121). Man is still responsible for his actions because he chose
them, and God is not responsible because he does not force people
to make these choices and instead *permits* them to make certain
choices.

### Objections

The objection to this view is that God is still responsible because
he is in control of the factors which influence a person's choice.
Ware first points out that it is correct that God cannot directly
do evil, and that he cannot force (tempt) anyone to do evil (James
1:13). Second, however, he shows that it is a mistake to assume
that it is the factors (or circumstances) that control one's
choice. He states that it is not the factors that ultimately cause
the agent to choose, nor is it God.

Rather, in light of the *nature of that person*, when certain
factors are present, his nature will respond to those factors and
seek to do what he, by nature, wants most to do (Ware, p. 122).
Thus, it is by nature that humanity chooses what they desire the
most. Although circumstances can influence a choice, they are
ultimately grounded in man's nature. God simply permits these
choices, knowing through his middle knowledge what each person will
do in any circumstance. Therefore, God can both permit evil, and be
in control of it.
