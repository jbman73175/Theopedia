**Complementarianism** is the theological view that although men
and women are created equal in their being and personhood, they are
created to complement each other via different roles and
responsibilities as manifested in marriage, family life, religious
leadership, and elsewhere. It is rooted in more literal
interpretations of the Creation account and the roles of men and
women presented in Scripture. It is also known as the
Traditionalist or Hierarchical view. Though the notion is found in
other religions, this article focuses on how certain Christian
groups understand their theology to require a complementarian view
of gender.

Among evangelicals, particularly in the last few decades, two
rather different paradigms concerning roles of men and women
presented in Scripture have emerged.

-   One is evangelical
    *[egalitarianism](Egalitarianism "Egalitarianism")* which asserts
    that there should be no gender-based role distinctions or
    limitations placed on women in the home, church, or society.
    According to this view, women can serve as pastors in light of
    passages like Galatians 3:28.
-   The other view is *Complementarianism* which is presented in
    this article.

## Etymology

The term *Complementarian* is derived from [L. *complementun*: cf.
F. *complement*, two parts that complete each other]. It is the
hermeneutical hypothesis, based on interpretations of scripture,
that men and women are designed by their Creator to *complement* or
complete each other on the basis of their gender. While certain
roles and responsibilities uniquely fall to the male, no
limitations of what functions he can fulfill in the home, the
church, and the society.

## The Complementarian position

Complementarianism holds that "God has created men and women equal
in their essential dignity and human personhood, but different and
complementary in function with male headship in the home and in the
Church. "^[[1]](#note-0)^

It is usually characterized by:

-   A generally patriarchal view of the family (the father is
    responsible to lead, provide for, teach his children to know and
    love God) as found in Scripture.
-   Belief that a Christian husband should love his wife as Christ
    loved the church
-   Belief that a Christian wife should submit to her husband as
    the church submits to Christ
-   Belief that God designed marriage to reflect the relationship
    of Jesus Christ and the Church
-   Belief that only men should be appointed into authoritative
    positions of leadership in the church

The Complementarian view of marriage maintains that gender-based
roles and a husband-headship structure in marriage is biblically
required.^[[2]](#note-BFM2000)^ A husband is considered to have the
God-given responsibility to provide for, protect, and lead "his"
family, while a wife is to collaborate with her husband, respect
him, and serve as his helper in managing the household and
nurturing the next generation. Complementarians assert that the
Bible instructs husbands to lovingly lead their families and to
love their wives as [Christ](Christ "Christ") loves the Church, and
instructs wives to respect their husbands’ leadership out of
reverence for
[Christ](Christ "Christ").^[[3]](#note-1)^^[[4]](#note-2)^

The Complementarian position has been articulated and defended by
several evangelical and reformed leaders in what is called the
Danvers Statement. It is so called because it was prepared by
several evangelical leaders at a Council on Biblical Manhood and
Womanhood (CBMW) meeting in Danvers, Massachusetts, in December
1987.^[[5]](#note-Danvers)^ Their understanding of the necessity
for gender-based roles and authority structure in marriage and in
ministry is based on their interpretation of scriptures such as Eph
5:21-33, Col 3:18-19, Tit 2:3-5, 1 Pet 3:1-7.

### Roles in marriage

The Complementarian view of marriage maintains gender-based roles
and a husband-headship structure in marriage.^[[2]](#note-BFM2000)^
A husband is understood to have a God-given responsibility to
provide for, protect, and lead his family. A wife is to collaborate
with her husband, respect him, and serve as his helper in managing
the household and nurturing the next generation. Complementarians
assert that the Bible instructs husbands to lovingly lead their
families and to love their wives as [Christ](Christ "Christ") loves
the Church, and instructs wives to respect their husbands’
leadership out of reverence for
[Christ](Christ "Christ").^[[6]](#note-3)^^[[7]](#note-4)^

A more detailed statement of the Complementarian view of marriage
appears in Southern Baptist Convention's
*Baptist Faith and Message (2000).* While it is
denominational-specific, it is consistent with most present-day
Complementarian views in conservative Christianity:

> The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are
> created in God's image. The marriage relationship models the way
> God relates to his people. A husband is to love his wife as Christ
> loved the church. He has the God-given responsibility to provide
> for, to protect, and to lead his family. A wife is to submit
> herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband even as
> the church willingly submits to the headship of Christ. She, being
> in the image of God as is her husband and thus equal to him, has
> the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as
> his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next
> generation. {{\#if:Article XVIII. The Family.

> – Article XVIII. The Family.
> *Baptist Faith and Message 2000*^[[8]](#note-5)^{{\#if:|,
> *{{{3}}}*}}{{\#if:|, {{{4}}}}}
>

The Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood teaches that "Christ
is the supreme authority and guide for men and women, so that no
earthly submission—domestic, religious, or civil—ever implies a
mandate to follow a human authority into sin."^[[9]](#note-6)^

### Roles in the Church

Complementarians view women's roles in ministry, particularly in
church settings, as limited on the basis of interpretations of
certain scriptures. The Complementarian view holds that women may
not appropriately hold church leadership roles that involve
teaching or authority over men.^[[10]](#note-19_objections)^ This
therefore includes pastors, deacons, ruling elders, and teachers
where men are in the class.

Concerning women in ministry, a former president of the Southern
Baptist Convention has written that "...while both men and women
are gifted for service in the church, the office of Pastor is
limited to men as qualified by
Scripture."^[[2]](#note-BFM2000)^^[[11]](#note-7)^ The Council on
Biblical Manhood and Womanhood holds that “[i]n the church,
redemption in Christ gives men and women an equal share in the
blessings of salvation; nevertheless, some governing and teaching
roles within the church are restricted to men (Gal. 3:28; 1 Cor.
11:2-16; 1 Tim. 2:11-15).”^[[12]](#note-8)^ Some believe that women
should be ordained neither as a pastor nor as an evangelist, while
others believe that it is acceptable for women to be evangelists
but not pastors.^[[13]](#note-9)^

## Complementarian advocates

Complementarianism is promoted by the Council on Biblical Manhood
and Womanhood. Groups of churches that broadly support this
position include some members of the
[Southern Baptist Convention](Southern_Baptist_Convention "Southern Baptist Convention"),^[[2]](#note-BFM2000)^
the Presbyterian Church of America, the Anglican Diocese of Sydney,
Conservative Mennonites, Newfrontiers, the Dutch Reformed Church,
and Sovereign Grace Ministries, among others. A moderate form of
complementarianism is espoused by the Calvary Chapel movement.

Noted theologians and Christian thinkers who support (or supported)
the Complementarian position include men such as
[Wayne Grudem](Wayne_Grudem "Wayne Grudem"), R. Albert Mohler, Jr.,
[Mark Dever](Mark_Dever "Mark Dever"),
[Mark Driscoll](Mark_Driscoll "Mark Driscoll"), C. J. Mahaney,
Adrian Rogers, Richard Land,
[Ligon Duncan](J._Ligon_Duncan_III "J. Ligon Duncan III"),
[Terry Virgo](Terry_Virgo "Terry Virgo"),
[John F. MacArthur](John_MacArthur "John MacArthur"),
[C.S. Lewis](C._S._Lewis "C. S. Lewis"), and John Piper. Also in
support are women like Elisabeth Elliot, missionary and wife of the
missionary Jim Elliot.

## Hermeneutics

The term is derived from the hermeneutical hypothesis that men and
women are designed to *complement* or complete each other on the
basis of their gender. Contrasting viewpoints maintain either that
women and men should share identical authority and responsibilities
in marriage, religion and elsewhere, or that men and women are of
intrinsically different worth, and their roles reflect that.
