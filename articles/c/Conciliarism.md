**Conciliarism** was a movement in
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") theology that the
[church councils](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils") were
of higher authority in the church than the [pope](Pope "Pope"). It
began in the 15th century with the Council of Constance (1414-18)
and the Council of Basel (1431-38). In the end, the Papacy was
victorious through the condemnation of conciliarism at the Fifth
Lateran Council (1512-17).
