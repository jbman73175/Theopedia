sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9)

## Notes

1.  [↑](#ref-0) Except in the case of a priest where he must also
    confess sins for others: Leviticus 16:21. The exception to this is
    Jesus Christ: Hebrews 7:26-27.
2.  [↑](#ref-1) All sin should be confessed to God. However,
    confession of private sin to fellow believers is a debated topic.
    Public sin should definitely be confessed to fellow believers.
