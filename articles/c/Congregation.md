A **congregation** is the group of members who make up a local
church. It also refers to those who are present at a service, as
opposed to the building itself.

In the polity of [Presbyterianism](Presbyterian "Presbyterian"),
several congregations make up a local Presbytery. In the polity of
[Baptists](Baptists "Baptists") and Bible churches, the local
congregation is autonomous.
