**Congregationalism** is a form of
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") Christianity that arose in
England in the late 16th and 17th centuries. It emphasizes the
right and responsibility of each properly organized congregation to
determine its own affairs, without having to submit these decisions
to the judgment of any higher human authority, and as such it
eliminated [bishops](Bishop "Bishop") and
[presbyteries](index.php?title=Presbytery&action=edit&redlink=1 "Presbytery (page does not exist)").
Each individual church is regarded as independent and autonomous.
[Baptists](Baptists "Baptists") also practice this form of church
government, but they are not referred to under the term
Congregationalists. Congregationalists are those who practice this
form of polity *while also maintaining* the practice of
[infant baptism](Infant_baptism "Infant baptism") like
[Presbyterians](Presbyterian "Presbyterian").
