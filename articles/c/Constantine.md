**Constantine** (February 27, 272–May 22, 337), commonly known as
**Constantine I** or **Constantine the Great**, was proclaimed
Augustus by his troops on July 25, 306 and ruled an ever-growing
portion of the Roman Empire until his death. Constantine is famed
for his refounding of Byzantium (modern Istanbul) as "Nova Roma"
(New Rome), which was popularly known in his time as "Constantine's
City"— (Constantinopolis, Constantinople). Constantine is best
remembered in modern times for the Edict of Milan in 313 and the
[First Council of Nicaea](First_Council_of_Nicaea "First Council of Nicaea")
in 325, which fully legalized and then legitimized Christianity in
the Empire for the first time. These actions are considered major
factors in that religion's spread, and his reputation as the "first
Christian Emperor" has been promulgated by historians from
Lactantius and
[Eusebius of Caesarea](Eusebius_of_Caesarea "Eusebius of Caesarea")
to the present day.
