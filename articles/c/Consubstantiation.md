**Consubstantiation** is a philosophical theory that, like the
competing theory of
[transubstantiation](Transubstantiation "Transubstantiation"),
attempts to describe the nature of the
[Christian](Christianity "Christianity")
[Eucharist](Eucharist "Eucharist") in concrete metaphysical terms.
It holds that during the [sacrament](Sacrament "Sacrament") the
fundamental *substance* of the body and blood of Christ are present
*alongside* the substance of the bread and wine, which remain
present. Transubstantiation differs from consubstantiation in that
it postulates that, through consecration by the priest, one set of
substances (bread and wine) is *exchanged* for another (the Body
and Blood of Christ) or that, according to some, the reality of the
bread and wine *become* the reality of the body and blood of
Christ. The *substance* of the bread and wine do not remain, but
their
*[accidents](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_(philosophy) "wikipedia:Accident (philosophy)")*
(superficial properties like appearance and taste) remain.

Consubstantiation is commonly—though erroneously—associated with
the teachings of [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") and
[Philipp Melanchthon](Philipp_Melanchthon "Philipp Melanchthon").
Lutheran teachings reject any attempt to explain philosophically
the means by which Christ is present in the Eucharist. Luther did
teach that the body and blood of Christ are present "in, with, and
under the forms" of bread and wine, and present-day Lutherans hold
to this statement while disagreeing about its exact meaning. Some
Lutherans do use the term "consubstantiation" to refer to this
belief, but the theology intended is not the same as the
philosophical theory described above. Luther illustrated his belief
about the Eucharist "by the analogy of the iron put into the fire
whereby both fire and iron are united in the red-hot iron and yet
each continues unchanged," ^[1](#Footnotes)^ a concept which he
called
*[sacramental union](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramental_Union "wikipedia:Sacramental Union").*
Consubstantiation is affirmed by a minority of Christians,
including some Eastern Orthodox churches.
