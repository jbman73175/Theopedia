**Contextualization**, within
[evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical")
[Christianity](Christianity "Christianity"), is communicating the
[gospel](Gospel "Gospel") using methods and terms appropriate to a
given audience. It represents the understanding that although the
gospel message is abiding and universal, the cultural contexts in
which [God](God "God") revealed it and in which it is delivered are
distinct and different.
