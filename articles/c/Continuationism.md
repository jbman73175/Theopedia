**Continuationism** is the belief that the supernatural gifts of
the Holy Spirit taught in the bible -- such as prophecy, tongues,
interpretation of tongues, healings, miracles, etc. -- have not
ceased and are available for the believer today (1 Cor. 1:7).
Continuationism is the opposite of
[Cessationism](Cessationism "Cessationism") which teaches that
supernatural gifts have ceased either when the canon of Scripture
was completed or at the death of the last apostle. Those who hold
to continuationism are called continuationists or
non-cessationists.
