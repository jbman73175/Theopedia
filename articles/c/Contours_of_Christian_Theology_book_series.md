The **Contours of Christian Theology** is a book series published
with [InterVarsity Press](http://www.ivpress.com/) and is edited by
[Gerald Bray](Gerald_Bray "Gerald Bray"). The series is designed to
treat to main themes of Christian doctrine in a way that
"compliments the traditional textbooks but does not copy them."
Each volume focuses on contemporary issues, and the goal is "to
rework the orthodox evangelical position in a fresh and compelling
way." ^[[1]](#note-0)^ Technical vocabulary has been defined for
the non-specialist reader, and the presentation "has avoided the
extremes of academic style."
