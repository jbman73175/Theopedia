## Methods of contraception

**Abstinence Based** - These methods work by abstaining totally or
within the time that a woman would be most likely to conveive
during her cycle. The two most notable methods would be Natural
Family Planning (NFP) and Fertility Awareness Method (FAM).
Advocates of these methods would generally refer to them only as
Family Planning and deny that they are practicing Birth Control or
Contraception.

**Barrier** - These methods work by blocking sperm from reaching
the egg. Condoms, Cervical Cap, and Diaphram.

**Hormonal** - Hormones that a woman takes through various forms to
prevent ovulation and to prevent implantation of fertilized eggs.
All methods are abortifaciant. Includes the pill, the patch,
Norplant, Depo Provera, Morning After or Emergency Contraception (a
high dose form of the pill used after "unprotected sex"), etc...
Ovulation is never stopped 100%.

**I.U.D.'s** - Intraunterine Devices - Device implanted in the
uterus to prevent the implantion of fertilized egg - a newly
conceived child. This method is an abortifacient. Does not stop
ovulation.

**Spermacidel** - Chemical used to kill sperm before it reaches the
egg.

**Surgical** - Vasectomy for males or Tubal Ligation for women.
Used to prevent sperm or egg from reaching each other. Considered a
permanent method but may be reversed.

## Abortifacients

Abortifacients are methods of contraception which work to prevent
the implantation of a fertilized egg (a newly conceived baby) into
the uterus, including hormonal methods and I.U.D.'s. Both these
types of methods sometimes work to irritate or change the lining of
the uterus in such as fashion as to stop implantation after
conception occurs, although some hormonal methods and IUD's work
primarily by preventing fertilization.^[[1]](#note-0)^
