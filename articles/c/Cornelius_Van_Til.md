## Biographical sketch

Born on May 3, 1895, in Grootegast, The Netherlands he was the
sixth son of Ite and Klazina Van Til, who emigrated to the United
States when "Kees," as he was known to friends, was 10. He grew up
helping on the family farm in Highland, Indiana.

Van Til graduated from Calvin College in 1922, receiving a ThM from
Princeton Theological Seminary in 1925 and his PhD from Princeton
University in 1927. He began teaching at Princeton, but shortly
went with the conservative group who founded Westminster
Theological Seminary, where he taught for forty-three years of his
life as a professor of [apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics").

He was also a minister in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church from the
1930s until his death in 1987, and in that denomination, he was
embroiled in a bitter dispute with Gordon Clark over God's
incomprehensibility known as the Clark-Van Til Controversy in
which, according to [John Frame](John_Frame "John Frame"), neither
man was at his best and neither quite understood the other's
position.

## Van Til's thought

Van Til is perhaps best known for the development of a fresh
approach to the task of defending the Christian faith. Although
trained in traditional methods he drew on the insights of fellow
Calvinistic philosophers Vollenhoven and
[Herman Dooyeweerd](Herman_Dooyeweerd "Herman Dooyeweerd") to
formulate what he viewed as a more consistently Christian
methodology. His apologetic focused on the role of presuppositions,
the point of contact between believers and unbelievers, and the
antithesis between Christian and non-Christian worldviews.

He didn't particularly care for the label describing his approach
as "presuppositional," which more accurately represents the
apologetical method of [Gordon Clark](Gordon_Clark "Gordon Clark"),
but he (and his students) accepted it as a matter of convention
because it is at least useful in grouping methods into those which
deny neutrality and those which do not.

In *Van Til: The Theologian*, Frame, a sympathetic critic of Van
Til, describes Van Til's contributions to Christian thought as
comparable in magnitude to those of
[Immanuel Kant](Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") in non-Christian
philosophy. He indicates that Van Til identified the disciplines of
[systematic theology](Systematic_theology "Systematic theology")
and apologetics, seeing the former as a positive statement of the
Christian faith and the latter as a defense of that statement -- "a
difference in emphasis rather than of subject matter." Frame
summarizes Van Til's legacy as one of new applications of
traditional doctrines:

Unoriginal as his doctrinal formulations may be, his use of those
formulations -- his application of them -- is often quite
remarkable. The
[sovereignty of God](Sovereignty_of_God "Sovereignty of God")
becomes an [epistemological](Epistemology "Epistemology"), as well
as a religious and [metaphysical](Metaphysics "Metaphysics")
principle. The [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") becomes the answer to
the philosophical problem of the one and the many.
[Common grace](Common_grace "Common grace") becomes the key to a
Christian philosophy of history. These new applications of familiar
doctrines inevitably increase [Christians'] understanding of the
doctrines themselves, for [they] come thereby to a new appreciation
of what these doctrines demand of [them]. Sometimes these new
understandings are of quite a radical sort -- radical enough to
require new formulations, or at least supplementary formulations,
of the doctrines themselves. Van Til...rarely provides such revised
formulations, though he does at some significant points.... But
there is much in Van Til that will require future orthodox Reformed
dogmaticians to rethink much of the traditional language and thus
to go beyond Van Til himself. Not that the traditional language is
wrong (generally speaking); it is just that through reading Van Til
we often become painfully aware of how much more needs to be said.
Similarly, Van Til's innovative application of the doctrines of
[total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity") and the
ultimate authority of God led to his reforming of the discipline of
apologetics. Specifically, he denied neutrality on the basis of the
total depravity of man and the invasive effects of sin on man's
reasoning ability (as per the usual Calvinistic understanding of
the first chapter of the
[Epistle to the Romans](Epistle_to_the_Romans "Epistle to the Romans")),
and he insisted that the Bible, which he viewed as a divinely
inspired book, be trusted preeminently because he believed the
Christian's ultimate commitment must rest on the ultimate authority
of God. As Frame says elsewhere, "the foundation of Van Til's
system and its most persuasive principle" is a rejection of
autonomy since "Christian thinking, like all of the Christian life,
is subject to God's lordship"
(*Van Til and the Ligonier Apologetic*, p. 282).

Many recent theologians have been influenced by Van Til's thought,
including [John Frame](John_Frame "John Frame"),
[Greg Bahnsen](Greg_Bahnsen "Greg Bahnsen"),
[R. J. Rushdoony](Rousas_John_Rushdoony "Rousas John Rushdoony"),
and current Westminster Theological Seminary faculty members Vern
Poythress, William Edgar, and K. Scott Oliphint.
