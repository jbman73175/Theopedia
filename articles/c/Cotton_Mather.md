Cotton Mather
**Cotton Mather** (1663 â€“ 1728) was a socially and politically
influential [Puritan](Puritan "Puritan") minister, prolific author,
and pamphleteer in New England. He received a B.A. at Harvard
College (1678), and a M.A. in 1681. He also received an honorary
doctorate from the University of Glasgow in 1710. Cotton Mather,
likely named after his grandfather, John Cotton, was the son of
influential minister Increase Mather. He is often remembered for
his persecution of witches and association with the Salem witch
trials.

## Background

After completing his post-graduate work, he joined his father as
assistant Pastor of Boston's original North Church (not to be
confused with the Anglican/Episcopal Old North Church). It was not
until his father's death, in 1723 that Mather assumed full
responsibilities as Pastor at the Church.

Author of more than 450 books and pamphlets, Cotton Mather's
ubiquitous literary works made him one of the most influential
religious leaders in America. Mather set the nation's "moral tone,"
and sounded the call for second and third generation Puritans,
whose parents had left England for the New England colonies of
North America to return to the theological roots of Puritanism.

A friend of a number of the judges charged with hearing the Salem
witch trials, Mather on numerous occasions warned against "spectral
evidence" (testimony about dreams and visions, accepted as evidence
in court). Writing of the trials later, Mather stated:

"If in the midst of the many Dissatisfactions among us, the
publication of these Trials may promote such a pious Thankfulness
unto God, for Justice being so far executed among us, I shall
Re-joyce that God is Glorified. . ." (Wonders of the Invisible
World).
