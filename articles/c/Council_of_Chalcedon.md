The **Council of Chalcedon** was an ecumenical council that took
place from October 8-November 1, 451 A.D at Chalcedon, a city of
Bithynia in Asia Minor. It is the fourth of the first seven
[Ecumenical Councils](Ecumenical_Councils "Ecumenical Councils") in
Christianity. It repudiated the Eutychian doctrine of
[monophysitism](Monophysitism "Monophysitism"), and set forth the
[Chalcedonian Creed](Chalcedonian_Creed "Chalcedonian Creed"),
which describes the
[full humanity](Humanity_of_Jesus "Humanity of Jesus") and
[full divinity of Jesus Christ](Deity_of_Jesus "Deity of Jesus"),
the second person of the Holy [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity").
