The **Council of Ephesus** was held in Ephesus, Asia Minor in 431
under Emperor Theodosius II, grandson of Theodosius the Great.
Approximately two-hundred Bishops were present. The proceedings
were conducted in a heated atmosphere of confrontation and
recriminations. It was the third of the so-called
[Ecumenical Councils](Ecumenical_Councils "Ecumenical Councils")
and was chiefly concerned with the [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") of
[Nestorianism](Nestorianism "Nestorianism").

According to the Council, Nestorianism overemphasized the human
nature of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") at the expense of the divine. The
Council denounced Patriarch Nestorius' teaching as erroneous.
Nestorius taught that the Virgin Mary gave birth to a man, Jesus
Christ, not God, the "Logos" ("The Word", Son of God). The Logos
only dwelled in Christ, as in a Temple (Christ, therefore, was only
Theophoros: The "Bearer of God".) Consequently, Virgin Mary should
be called "Christotokos," Mother of Christ and not "Theotokos,
"Mother of God." Hence, the name, "Christological controversies".

The Council decreed that Jesus was one person, not two separate
"people": complete God and complete man, with a rational soul and
body. The Virgin Mary is "Theotokos" because she gave birth not to
man but to God as a man. The union of the two natures of Christ
took place in such a fashion that one did not disturb the other.

The Council also declared the text of the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") decreed at the First
and Second Ecumenical Councils to be complete and forbade any
additional change (addition or deletion) to it. In addition, it
condemned [Pelagianism](Pelagianism "Pelagianism").
