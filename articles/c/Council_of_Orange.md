The local **Council of Orange** (France), not considered one of the
[ecumenical councils](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils"),
was called by Pope Felix IV in 529 A.D. The Council approved the
[Augustinian](Augustine "Augustine") doctrine of sin and grace over
against what would be called
[Semi-Pelagianism](Semi-Pelagianism "Semi-Pelagianism"), but
without Augustine's absolute predestination. The
**Canons of the Council of Orange** constitute the judgement of the
Council.

"Humanism, in all its subtle forms, recapitulates the unvarnished
Pelagianism against which Augustine struggled. Though Pelagius was
condemned as a heretic by Rome, and its modified form,
Semi-Pelagianism was likewise condemned by the Council of Orange in
529, the basic assumptions of this view persisted throughout church
history to reappear in Medieval Catholicism, Renaissance Humanism,
Socinianism, Arminianism, and modern Liberalism."
