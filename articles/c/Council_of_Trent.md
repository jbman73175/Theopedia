The **Council of Trent** is reckoned by the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
to be the Nineteenth
[Ecumenical Council](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils")
held from December 13, 1545 to December 4, 1563. It was held in the
Italian city of Trent.

It is considered one of the most important councils in the history
of the Roman Catholic Church, establishing church doctrine in
response to the [Reformation](Reformation "Reformation") and
condemning [Protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism"). It
clearly specified Catholic doctrines on
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation"), the
[sacraments](Sacrament "Sacrament"), the biblical
[canon](Development_of_the_canon "Development of the canon"), and
standardized the [Mass](Mass "Mass") throughout the church, largely
abolishing local variations. This became called the "Tridentine
Mass", from the city's Latin name *Tridentum*.

## Notable canons

### Concerning justification

Canon 1. "If any one saith, that man may be justified before God by
his own works, whether done through the teaching of human nature,
or that of the law, without the grace of God through Jesus Christ;
let him be anathema."

Canon 4. "If any one saith, that man's free will moved and excited
by God, by assenting to God exciting and calling, nowise
co-operates towards disposing and preparing itself for obtaining
the grace of Justification; that it cannot refuse its consent, if
it would, but that, as something inanimate, it does nothing
whatever and is merely passive; let him be anathema."

Canon 9. "If any one saith, that by faith alone the impious is
justified; in such wise as to mean, that nothing else is required
to co-operate in order to the obtaining the grace of Justification,
and that it is not in any way necessary, that he be prepared and
disposed by the movement of his own will; let him be anathema."

Canon 11. "If any one saith, that men are justified, either by the
sole imputation of the justice of Christ, or by the sole remission
of sins, to the exclusion of the grace and the charity which is
poured forth in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is inherent in
them; or even that the grace, whereby we are justified, is only the
favour of God; let him be anathema."

Canon 12. "If any one saith, that justifying faith is nothing else
but confidence in the divine mercy which remits sins for Christ's
sake; or, that this confidence alone is that whereby we are
justified; let him be anathema."

Canon 24. "If any one saith, that the justice received is not
preserved and also increased before God through good works; but
that the said works are merely the fruits and signs of
Justification obtained, but not a cause of the increase thereof;
let him be anathema."

Canon 30. "If any one saith, that, after the grace of Justification
has been received, to every penitent sinner the guilt is remitted,
and the debt of eternal punishment is blotted out in such wise,
that there remains not any debt of temporal punishment to be
discharged either in this world, or in the next in Purgatory,
before the entrance to the kingdom of heaven can be opened (to
him); let him be anathema."

Canon 32. "If any one saith, that the good works of one that is
justified are in such manner the gifts of God, as that they are not
also the good merits of him that is justified; or, that the said
justified, by the good works which he performs through the grace of
God and the merit of Jesus Christ, whose living member he is, does
not truly merit increase of grace, eternal life, and the attainment
of that eternal life, ...and also an increase of glory; let him be
anathema."
