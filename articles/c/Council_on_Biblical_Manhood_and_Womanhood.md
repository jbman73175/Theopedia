The **Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood** (CBMW) is the
leading evangelical Christian organization that promotes a
Complementarian (as opposed to an Egalitarian) view of gender
issues as they affect Christians. It was founded in 1987 by a group
of pastors and scholars concerned about the influence of secular
feminism in society and in evangelical
churches.^[[1]](#note-AboutUs)^ They articulated what is now known
as the Complementarian position which affirms that men and women
are equal in the image of God, but maintain complementary
differences in role and function.

> In the home, men lovingly are to lead their wives and family as
> women intelligently are to submit to the leadership of their

## Some CBMW contributions

CBMW defines the complementarian position and promotes its
acceptance and application. CBMW currently encourages adherence to
the *Danvers Statement.* It influences the adoption of the
*Danvers Statement* by churches, denominations, and parachurch
organizations. It also continues to articulate a unified
complementarian position.

One of CBMW's stated purposes is to serve as "the evangelical voice
for the biblical view of gender to the Christian community and the
world."^[[2]](#note-WhyWeExist)^ CBMW publishes a biannual journal
on gender issues, called the
*Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood*.^[[3]](#note-0)^ CBMW
also maintains a web site which offers a blog and an online store;
they indicate that 500,000 people from 34 nations visit their web
site each year.^[[2]](#note-WhyWeExist)^ CBMW also sponsors various
conferences, debates, articles, and books.

CBMW assists organizations and denominations such as FamilyLife (a
division of Campus Crusade), the Southern Baptist Convention, and
the Presbyterian Church in America, which have all taken
complementarian stands.

CBMW has drawn media attention by expressing concerns about
gender-neutral translations of the Bible,^[[4]](#note-1)^ and even
developed a web site^[[5]](#note-2)^ dealing exclusively with that
issue. CBMW's Statement of Concern about the TNIV Bible was
endorsed by evangelical leaders across the United States, including
James Dobson and Chuck Colson.^[[6]](#note-3)^

## CBMW's Mission and Vision

CBMW's mission is "to set forth the teachings of the Bible about
the complementary differences between men and women, created
equally in the image of God, because these teachings are essential
for obedience to Scripture and for the health of the family and the
church."^[[7]](#note-Mission)^

CBMW's vision is "to see the vast majority of evangelical homes,
churches, academic institutions, and other ministries adopt the
principles of the *Danvers Statement* as a part of their personal
convictions and doctrinal confessions and apply them in consistent,
heart-felt practice."^[[7]](#note-Mission)^

## *Danvers Statement*

The *Danvers Statement* is an official statement of the
complementarian Christian view of gender roles. It is not the
product of any particular Christian denomination, but has been
endorsed or cited by many Christian groups. It was first published
by the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW) in Wheaton,
Illinois, in November 1988. Work on the statement began with
"several evangelical leaders" at a CBMW meeting in Danvers,
Massachusetts, in December of 1987. In 1989, a paid advertisement
center-spread appeared in the January 13 issue of
*Christianity Today* accompanied with the Danvers Statement.

### Text of the Statement

> **The *Danvers Statement* on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood**
> #### Rationale
> 
> We have been moved in our purpose by the following contemporary
> developments which we observe with deep concern:
> 
> 1.  The widespread uncertainty and confusion in our culture
>     regarding the complementary differences between masculinity and
>     femininity;
> 2.  The tragic effects of this confusion in unraveling the fabric
>     of marriage woven by God out of the beautiful and diverse strands
>     of manhood and womanhood;
> 3.  The increasing promotion given to feminist egalitarianism with
>     accompanying distortions or neglect of the glad harmony portrayed
>     in Scripture between the loving, humble leadership of redeemed
>     husbands and the intelligent, willing support of that leadership by
>     redeemed wives;
> 4.  The widespread ambivalence regarding the values of motherhood,
>     vocational homemaking, and the many ministries historically
>     performed by women;
> 5.  The growing claims of legitimacy for sexual relationships which
>     have biblically and historically been considered illicit or
>     perverse, and the increase in pornographic portrayal of human
>     sexuality;
> 6.  The upsurge of physical and emotional abuse in the family;
> 7.  The emergence of roles for men and women in church leadership
>     that do not conform to biblical teaching but backfire in the
>     crippling of biblically faithful witness;
> 
> The increasing prevalence and acceptance of hermeneutical oddities
> devised to reinterpret apparently plain meanings of biblical
> texts;
> 
> 1.  The consequent threat to Biblical authority as the clarity of
>     Scripture is jeopardized and the accessibility of its meaning to
>     ordinary people is withdrawn into the restricted realm of technical
>     ingenuity;
> 2.  And behind all this the apparent accommodation of some within
>     the church to the spirit of the age at the expense of winsome,
>     radical Biblical authenticity which in the power of the Holy Spirit
>     may reform rather than reflect our ailing culture.
> 
> #### Affirmations
> 
> Based on our understanding of Biblical teachings, we affirm the
> following:
> 
> 1.  Both Adam and Eve were created in God's image, equal before God
>     as persons and distinct in their manhood and womanhood (Gen
>     1:26–27, 2:18).
> 2.  Distinctions in masculine and feminine roles are ordained by
>     God as part of the created order, and should find an echo in every
>     human heart (Gen 2:18, 21–24; 1 Cor 11:7–9; 1 Tim 2:12–14).
> 3.  Adam's headship in marriage was established by God before the
>     Fall, and was not a result of sin (Gen 2:16–18, 21–24, 3:1–13; 1
>     Cor 11:7–9).
> 4.  The Fall introduced distortions into the relationships between
>     men and women (Gen 3:1–7, 12, 16).
> 5.  \*In the home, the husband's loving, humble headship tends to
>     be replaced by domination or passivity; the wife's intelligent,
>     willing submission tends to be replaced by usurpation or servility.
> 6.  \*In the church, sin inclines men toward a worldly love of
>     power or an abdication of spiritual responsibility, and inclines
>     women to resist limitations on their roles or to neglect the use of
>     their gifts in appropriate ministries.
> 7.  The Old Testament, as well as the New Testament, manifests the
>     equally high value and dignity which God attached to the roles of
>     both men and women (Gen 1:26–27, 2:18; Gal 3:28). Both Old and New
>     Testaments also affirm the principle of male headship in the family
>     and in the covenant community (Gen 2:18; Eph 5:21–33; Col 3:18–19;
>     1 Tim 2:11–15).
> 8.  Redemption in Christ aims at removing the distortions
>     introduced by the curse.
> 9.  \*In the family, husbands should forsake harsh or selfish
>     leadership and grow in love and care for their wives; wives should
>     forsake resistance to their husbands' authority and grow in
>     willing, joyful submission to their husbands' leadership (Eph
>     5:21-33; Col 3:18–19; Tit 2:3–5; 1 Pet 3:1–7).
> 10. \*In the church, redemption in Christ gives men and women an
>     equal share in the blessings of salvation; nevertheless, some
>     governing and teaching roles within the church are restricted to
>     men (Gal 3:28; 1 Cor 11:2-16; 1 Tim 2:11–15).
> 11. In all of life Christ is the supreme authority and guide for
>     men and women, so that no earthly submission—domestic, religious,
>     or civil—ever implies a mandate to follow a human authority into
>     sin (Dan 3:10–18; Acts 4:19–20, 5:27–29; 1 Pet 3:1–2).
> 12. In both men and women a heartfelt sense of call to ministry
>     should never be used to set aside Biblical criteria for particular
>     ministries (1 Tim 2:11–15, 3:1–13; Tit 1:5–9). Rather, Biblical
>     teaching should remain the authority for testing our subjective
>     discernment of God's will.
> 13. With half the world's population outside the reach of
>     indigenous evangelism; with countless other lost people in those
>     societies that have heard the gospel; with the stresses and
>     miseries of sickness, malnutrition, homelessness, illiteracy,
>     ignorance, aging, addiction, crime, incarceration, neuroses, and
>     loneliness, no man or woman who feels a passion from God to make
>     His grace known in word and deed need ever live without a
>     fulfilling ministry for the glory of Christ and the good of this
>     fallen world (1 Cor 12:7–21).
> 14. We are convinced that a denial or neglect of these principles
>     will lead to increasingly destructive consequences in our families,
>     our churches, and the culture at large.
