In the general sense, a **covenant** is simply a binding agreement
or compact between two or more parties; in legal terms, it is a
formal sealed agreement or contract.

Classically, covenants are between nations or other powerful groups
(for example, 1 Samuel 11:1; Joshua 9:6,15). At the international
level they usually involve an alliance between two unequal parties
- the stronger one pledging protection and help to the weaker in
return for some form of vassal status (as in vassal treaties).

This is similar to the biblical picture of [God's](God "God")
relationship with his people, except that the inequality between
the parties (Creator and creatures) is absolute. It is always made
clear that the initiative is God's - that He makes covenants with
his people and not vice versa. God initiates, confirms and even
fulfills (ultimately in Christ, both sides of) the covenant.

In the [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") the word
*covenant* is translated from the [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew")
*berîyth*
^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#1285](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=1285&version=nas)]*^.
This Hebrew word derives from a root which means "to cut" and hence
a covenant is a "cutting" with reference to the ancient custom of
cutting or dividing animals into two parts with the contracting
parties passing between them, in making a covenant, see for example
Jeremiah 34:18-19. Some suggest the parties of the covenant are
thereby saying in essence, "May I be torn apart like these animals
if I fail to uphold my part of this covenant." This is illustrated
in Genesis 15, as God alone passes between the slaughtered animals
while [Abraham](Abraham "Abraham") sleeps, again emphasizing the
unilateral nature of this covenant, as well as the ultimate level
of commitment involved - God putting his very life on line, as it
were, as guarantee.

In the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), the
[Greek](Greek "Greek") word *diathēkē*
^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#1242](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=1242&version=nas)]*^
similarly means covenant, testament, or will. In fact, the Old and
New "Testaments" are really the Old and New "Covenants" - the new
covenant being of course that which was established by Christ
through His shed blood for the remission of sins (Matthew 26:28).

The amazing thing about such examples of divine covenant is that
they are the gracious means of relationship with God for a people
who deserve to be removed from His presence forever, by a God who
has no need whatsoever, in and of Himself, for such relationship.
Indeed, the heart of covenant, as so often and wonderfully
recapitulated by God Himself, is that expression of intimate
relationship: "you will be my people, and I will be your God" (e.g.
Jeremiah 30:22).

Three crucial aspects of divine covenent have been outlined above:
unilateral establishment, relational bond, and ultimate commitment.
Each of these aspects is brought out in O. Palmer Robertson's
definition of covenant as "a bond in blood sovereignly
administered."

## The nature of God's covenants

"God's covenants contain two especially important components: terms
and duration. Although humans may reach covenants or other
agreements through their own devices, God's covenants with people
are usually unilateral. He alone determines the terms and
conditions; humans choose whether to accept them.

"For example, after God clearly defined aspects of the covenant He
was making with the nation of Israel, including the blessings for
honoring it and the consequences for ignoring it (Leviticus 26;
Deuteronomy 28-30), both parties - God and the people of Israel -
accepted it. Through this process God and Israel entered into a
covenant relationship, a binding commitment to honor and fulfill
their respective roles.

"A second important concept for us to understand about God's
covenant with Israel is its continuing relevance to our day. In
reaffirming the covenant with the generation of Israelites who were
poised to enter the Promised Land, Moses explained that they were
doing this "that (God) may establish you today as a people for
Himself, and that He may be God to you, just as He has spoken to
you, and just as He has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob. I make this covenant and this oath, not with you alone,
but with him who stands here with us today before the LORD our God,
as well as with him who is not here with us today" (Deuteronomy
29:13-15). The covenant clearly applied to Israel's descendants as
well."

Given, on the one hand, the unilateral nature of divine covenant
and its gracious and promissory nature, while on the other, the
presence of stipulations the question of the conditionality or
otherwise of individual covenants is a difficult one, and there is
diversity of opinion. John Murray understands the answer to be in
the relational aspect of the covenant which when present "implies
mutuality" so that the conditions "are simply the reciprocal
responses of faith, love and obedience, apart from which the
enjoyment of the covenant blessing and of the covenant relation are
inconceivable. In a word, keeping the covenant presupposes the
covenant relation as established rather than the condition upon
which its establishment is contingent" (Murray, 19).

## Biblical Covenants

-   The [Noahic Covenant](Noahic_Covenant "Noahic Covenant"), found
    in [Genesis](Genesis "Genesis") 8:20-9:17.
-   The
    [Abrahamic Covenant](Abrahamic_Covenant "Abrahamic Covenant"),
    found in [Genesis](Genesis "Genesis")
    [chapter 15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15).
-   The [Mosaic Covenant](Mosaic_Covenant "Mosaic Covenant"), found
    in [Exodus](Book_of_Exodus "Book of Exodus")
    [chapters 19 through 24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+19-24).
-   The
    [Palestinian Covenant](index.php?title=Palestinian_Covenant&action=edit&redlink=1 "Palestinian Covenant (page does not exist)")
    -- an unconditional covenant enlarging upon the Abrahamic Covenant
    promising the seed of Abraham eternal possession in the land
    ([Deuteronomy](Deuteronomy "Deuteronomy")
    [30:1-10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut+30:1-10)),
    and
-   The [Davidic Covenant](Davidic_Covenant "Davidic Covenant"),
    found in [2 Samuel](Books_of_Samuel "Books of Samuel")
    [chapter 7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Samuel+7)
    establishing David and his lineage as the rightful kin]s of Israel
    and Judah and extending the covenant of Abraham to David's lineage.
-   The [New Covenant](New_Covenant "New Covenant"), predicted by
    the [prophet](Prophet "Prophet")
    [Jeremiah](index.php?title=Jeremiah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jeremiah (page does not exist)")
    in the eponymous book,
    [chapter 31](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+31),
    and connected with Jesus at the
    [Last Supper](Communion "Communion") where he says that the cup is
    "the New Covenant in [his] blood" and further in the
    [Epistle to the Hebrews](Epistle_to_the_Hebrews "Epistle to the Hebrews")
    ([chapters 8-10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+8-10)).
    The term "[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament")," most
    often used for the collection of books in the Bible, can also refer
    to the New Covenant as a theological concept.

## Theological Covenants

The following are called "theological covenants" because they are
not explicitly presented as "covenants" in the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"), although according to
[Covenant theologians](Covenant_Theology "Covenant Theology"), they
are theologically implicit:

-   [Covenant of Redemption](Covenant_of_Redemption "Covenant of Redemption")
-   [Covenant of Works](Covenant_of_Works "Covenant of Works")
-   [Covenant of Grace](Covenant_of_Grace "Covenant of Grace")
