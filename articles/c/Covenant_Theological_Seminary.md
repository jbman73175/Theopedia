## History

The seminary was originally established by
[Christians](Christian "Christian") in the Evangelical Presbyterian
Church, who believed that their denomination, born out of
resistance to rising liberal influences, needed a strong
[theological](Theology "Theology") school of its own. In 1956,
Covenant Seminary began with eleven students on a plot of land a
few miles west of St. Louis, Missouri. The seminary continued to
grow in both size and reputation in the years that followed. In
[1982](index.php?title=1982&action=edit&redlink=1 "1982 (page does not exist)"),
following a denominational merger (known as the "joining and
receiving") between what had become the Reformed Presbyterian
Church-Evangelical Synod (itself the result of a merger in 1965 of
the Evangelical Presbyterian Church and the Reformed Presbyterian
Church of North America-General Synod) and the PCA, Covenant
Seminary became the national seminary of the PCA, which elects and
oversees the work of the seminary's Board of Trustees.
