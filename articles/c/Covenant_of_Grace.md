The **Covenant of Grace** is one of the three theological covenants
of [Covenant theology](Covenant_theology "Covenant theology"): the
Covenant of Redemption, the
[Covenant of Works](Covenant_of_Works "Covenant of Works"), and the
Covenant of Grace. This third covenant, the Covenant of Grace,
promised eternal blessing for belief in Christ and obedience to
God's word. It is seen as the basis for all biblical covenants that
God made individually with Noah, Abraham, and David, nationally
with O.T. Israel as a people, and universally with man in the New
Covenant.

## Westminster Confession of Faith

-   VII.3. Man by his fall having made himself incapable of life by
    that covenant (the
    [Covenant of Works](Covenant_of_Works "Covenant of Works")), the
    Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the
    **covenant of grace**: wherein he freely offered unto sinners life
    and salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in him, that
    they may be saved, and promising to give unto all those that are
    ordained unto life, his Holy Spirit, to make them willing and able
    to believe.
-   VII.4. This covenant of grace is frequently set forth in the
    Scripture by the name of a testament, in reference to the death of
    Jesus Christ, the testator, and to the everlasting inheritance,
    with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed.
-   VII.5. This covenant was differently administered in the time
    of the law, and in the time of the gospel: under the law it was
    administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the
    paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the
    people of the Jews, all fore-signifying Christ to come, which were
    for that time sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of
    the Spirit, to instruct and build up the elect in faith in the
    promised Messiah, by whom they had full remission of sins, and
    eternal salvation, and is called the Old Testament.
-   VII.6. Under the gospel, when Christ the substance was
    exhibited, the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed, are
    the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments
    of Baptism and the Lord's Supper; which, though fewer in number,
    and administered with more simplicity and less outward glory, yet
    in them it is held forth in more fulness, evidence, and spiritual
    efficacy, to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles; and is called the
    New Testament. There are not, therefore, two covenants of grace
    differing in substance, but one and the same under various
    dispensations.
