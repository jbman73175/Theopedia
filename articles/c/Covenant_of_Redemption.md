The **Covenant of Redemption** is one of the three theological
covenants of
[Covenant theology](Covenant_theology "Covenant theology"): the
Covenant of Redemption, the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of
Grace. This Covenant of Redemption refers to the
[covenant](Covenant "Covenant") within the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") which established the plan of
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation"), i.e. the agreement within the
Godhead that the Father would appoint the Son to give up his life
for mankind and that Jesus would do so (cf. Titus 1:1-3).

## Phraseology

Although it is commonly called the "Covenant of Redemption," some
have suggested that this wording is inappropriate as applied to the
Godhead.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
There are a few reasons this has been suggested.

1 - Usually, the two sides of a [covenant](Covenant "Covenant") are
not equal. Rather, the [covenant](Covenant "Covenant") is
established by a sovereign person/nation with a lesser
person/nation. Historically (as in the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament")) a King would
covenant with a nation he defeated. On page 4 of Dr. O. Palmer
Robertson's book, "The Christ of the Covenants", he summarized this
by defining a covenant as "a bond in blood sovereignly
administered." Since the persons of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") are equal, there is no particular
sovereign in this "Agreement of Redemption."

2 - A [covenant](Covenant "Covenant") was instituted by blood
because it was a sign of what would happen to the person breaking
the covenant conditions. In this respect a
[covenant](Covenant "Covenant") and
[testament](index.php?title=Testament&action=edit&redlink=1 "Testament (page does not exist)")
are different. A
[testament](index.php?title=Testament&action=edit&redlink=1 "Testament (page does not exist)")
is enacted when the person dies, in a
[covenant](Covenant "Covenant") the person dies if he fails to
uphold his conditions. Although the Agreement of
[Redemption](Redemption "Redemption") was for
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") the Son to die, it was not because He
violated requirements placed on Him.

3 - One of the reasons for making a [covenant](Covenant "Covenant")
is the possibility of one of the parties breaking that
[covenant](Covenant "Covenant"). The Agreement of
[Redemption](Redemption "Redemption") never had the possibility of
failing in any respect.

It is therefore sometimes referred to as the "Intra-trinitarian
Covenant."
