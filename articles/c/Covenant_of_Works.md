In [Covenant theology](Covenant_theology "Covenant theology"), the
**Covenant of Works** is the second of three theological covenants.
It is that pre-[Fall](The_Fall "The Fall") agreement between God
and Adam in which Adam was promised blessing and life upon
obedience to the terms of the covenant and cursing and death should
he disobey the terms of the covenant. Covenant theologians maintain
that the requirements of the covenant relationship are clearly
defined in the commands that God gave to Adam and Eve (Genesis
1:28-30; cf 2:15) and in the direct command to Adam, 'You may
freely eat of every tree of the garden; but of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that
you eat of it you shall die' (Gen. 2:16â€“17).

The Bible teaches that in Adam, all broke the covenant (Hos. 6:7)
and so, in Adam all die (1 Cor. 15:22). Within covenant theology,
the [Covenant of Grace](Covenant_of_Grace "Covenant of Grace") is
God's covenant designed to bring humanity into a restored covenant
relationship with him, through the death of Christ.

## Westminster Confession of faith

-   VII.1. The distance between God and the creature is so great,
    that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as
    their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him, as
    their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescencion
    on God's part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of
    covenant.
-   VII.2. The first covenant made with man was a
    **covenant of works**, wherein life was promised to Adam, and in
    him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal
    obedience.
