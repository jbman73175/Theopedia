**Covenant Theology** (or **Federal theology**) is a prominent
feature in [Protestant](Protestantism "Protestantism")
[theology](Theology "Theology"), especially in the
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") and
[Reformed churches](Reformed_churches "Reformed churches"), and a
similar form is found in [Methodism](Methodism "Methodism") and
[Reformed Baptist](Reformed_Baptist "Reformed Baptist") churches.
This article primarily concerns Covenant Theology as held by the
Presbyterian and Reformed churches, which use the
[covenant](Covenant "Covenant") concept as an organizing principle
for Christian [theology](Theology "Theology") and view the history
of [redemption](Salvation "Salvation") under the framework of three
overarching theological covenants: the Covenant of Redemption, the
Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace. These three are
called "theological covenants" because although not explicitly
presented as covenants, they are, according to covenant
theologians, implicit in the [Bible](Bible "Bible").

In brief, Covenant Theology teaches that [God](God "God") has
established two great covenants with mankind and a covenant within
the [Godhead](Trinity "Trinity") to deal with how the other two
relate. The first covenant in logical order, usually called the
[Covenant of Redemption](Covenant_of_Redemption "Covenant of Redemption"),
is the agreement within the Godhead that the Father would appoint
his son [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") to give up his life for mankind and
that Jesus would do so (cf. Titus 1:1-3).

The second, called the
[Covenant of Works](Covenant_of_Works "Covenant of Works"), was
made in the [Garden of Eden](Garden_of_Eden "Garden of Eden")
between God and [Adam](Adam "Adam") and promised life for obedience
and death for disobedience. Adam disobeyed God and broke the
covenant, and so the third covenant was made between God and all of
mankind, who also fell with Adam according to Romans 5:12-21.

This third covenant, the
[Covenant of Grace](Covenant_of_Grace "Covenant of Grace"),
promised eternal blessing for belief in Christ and obedience to
God's word. It is thus seen as the basis for all biblical covenants
that God made individually with [Noah](Noah "Noah"),
[Abraham](Abraham "Abraham"), and [David](David "David"),
nationally with O.T. Israel as a people, and universally with man
in the New Covenant. These individual covenants are called the
"biblical covenants" because they are explicitly described as such
in the Bible.

Covenant theology as a refinement of
[Reformed theology](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology") is
evident among early Scottish theologians. For example, see
*The Theology and Theologians of Scotland, Chiefly of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries*
(1872) passage: "The old theology of Scotland might be emphatically
described as a *covenant theology*."^[[1]](#note-0)^

## History of Covenant Theology

Covenant theology has roots in the writings of
[Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") and
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin")
(*Institutes of the Christian Religion* 2:9-11).
[Johannes Cocceius](Johannes_Cocceius "Johannes Cocceius") (c.
1603-1669) developed the classical statement on covenant theology
in his *The Doctrine of the Covenant and Testament of God*
(*Summa doctrinae de foedere et testamento dei*, 1648). Covenant
theology was clearly expressed in the British
[Westminster Confession of Faith](Westminster_Confession_of_Faith "Westminster Confession of Faith")
(chap. 7) and further developed by
[Herman Witsius](Herman_Witsius "Herman Witsius") (1636-1708) in
the *Economy of the Covenants Between God and Man*. It may also be
seen in the writings of
[Jonathan Edwards](Jonathan_Edwards "Jonathan Edwards")
(*Collected Writings of Jonathan Edwards*, Vol 2, Banner of Truth
edition, p.950).

In the United States, the Princeton theologians
([Charles Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge"),
[A. A. Hodge](A._A._Hodge "A. A. Hodge"),
[B. B. Warfield](B._B._Warfield "B. B. Warfield"),
[Geerhardus Vos](Geerhardus_Vos "Geerhardus Vos"), and
[J. Gresham Machen](J._Gresham_Machen "J. Gresham Machen")) and, in
the Netherlands, [Herman Bavinck](Herman_Bavinck "Herman Bavinck")
followed the main lines of the classic view, teaching the Covenant
of Redemption, the Covenant of Works (Law), and the Covenant of
Grace ([Gospel](Gospel "Gospel")).

Current well-known Covenant theologians include
[R. C. Sproul](R._C._Sproul "R. C. Sproul"),
[J. I. Packer](J._I._Packer "J. I. Packer"),
[John Frame](John_Frame "John Frame"),
[Sinclair Ferguson](Sinclair_Ferguson "Sinclair Ferguson"),
[James Boice](index.php?title=James_Boice&action=edit&redlink=1 "James Boice (page does not exist)")
and [Michael S. Horton](Michael_S._Horton "Michael S. Horton").
This system is taught at schools such as Covenant Theological
Seminary, Reformed Theological Seminary, and Westminster
Theological Seminary.

As late as 1912 [B. B. Warfield](B._B._Warfield "B. B. Warfield")
agrees with an author whose work is being reviewed that the history
of Covenant theology has not been fully worked out.

## Covenant Theology and the Biblical Covenants

Covenant theology first sees a Covenant of Works administered with
[Adam](Adam "Adam") in the
[Garden of Eden](Garden_of_Eden "Garden of Eden"). Though it is not
explicitly called a covenant in the Bible, Hosea 6:7 has been
interpreted to support the idea. The specific covenants after the
fall of Adam are seen as administered under the overarching
theological Covenant of Grace and include:

-   The [Noahic Covenant](Noahic_Covenant "Noahic Covenant"), the
    covenant made with [Noah](Noah "Noah") and sealed with a rainbow.
    (Genesis 8:1-9:17)
-   The
    [Abrahamic covenant](Abrahamic_covenant "Abrahamic covenant"),
    found in [Genesis](Genesis "Genesis")
    [chapter 15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+15).
-   The [Mosaic Covenant](Mosaic_Covenant "Mosaic Covenant"), found
    in [Exodus](Book_of_Exodus "Book of Exodus")
    [chapters 19 through 24](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+19-24).
-   The
    [Palestinian Covenant](index.php?title=Palestinian_Covenant&action=edit&redlink=1 "Palestinian Covenant (page does not exist)")
    -- an unconditional covenant enlarging upon the Abrahamic Covenant
    promising the seed of Abraham eternal possession in the land
    (Deuteronomy 30:1-10), and
-   The [Davidic Covenant](Davidic_Covenant "Davidic Covenant"),
    found in [2 Samuel](Books_of_Samuel "Books of Samuel")
    [chapter 7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Samuel+7)
    establishing David and his lineage as the rightful kings of Israel
    and Judah and extending the covenant of Abraham to David's lineage.
-   The [New Covenant](New_Covenant "New Covenant"), predicted by
    the [prophet](Prophet "Prophet")
    [Jeremiah](index.php?title=Jeremiah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jeremiah (page does not exist)")
    in the eponymous book,
    [chapter 31](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+31),
    and connected with Jesus at the
    [Last Supper](Lord's_Supper "Lord's Supper") where he says that the
    cup is "the New Covenant in [his] blood" and further in the
    [Epistle to the Hebrews](Epistle_to_the_Hebrews "Epistle to the Hebrews")
    ([chapters 8-10](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+8-10)).
    The term "[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament")," most
    often used for the collection of books in the Bible, can also refer
    to the New Covenant as a theological concept.

## Diversity of Views

While all covenant theologians agree that there was a Covenant of
Works with Adam in the garden, and a single covenantal means of
salvation throughout history called the Covenant of Grace, there
remains a very wide diversity of views over the particulars of that
construction.

### Who is in the Covenant of Grace?

Henri Blocher refers to this as the thorn in the flesh of covenant
theologians ^[[3]](#note-2)^. The Westminster Larger Catechism,
Answer 31 states: "The covenant of grace was made with Christ as
the second Adam, and in him with all the elect as his seed."
However, Louis Berkhof notes "Reformed theologians are not
unanimous in answering this question. Some simply say that God made
the covenant with the sinner... Others assert that He established
it with... believers and their seed. The great majority of them,
however, maintain that He entered into covenant relationship with
the elect or the elect sinner in Christ. ^[[4]](#note-3)^

Speaking of this identification of the Covenant of Grace with the
Covenant of Redemption (rejecting a distinction between the two),
Berkhof asks "What induced these theologians to speak of the
covenant as made with the elect in spite of all the practical
difficulties involved?"^[[5]](#note-4)^ Meredith Kline argues that
these practical difficulties (i.e. infant baptism and a confusion
of the covenantal works/grace principle) requires a distinction
between the Covenant of Grace and the Covenant of Redemption. "In
the series of administrations of the Covenant of grace the covenant
is made by the Lord with those who confess the faith and their
children; the covenant membership includes others than the elect -
they are not all (elect) Israel who are of (covenant)
Israel."^[[6]](#note-5)^

### Conditionality of the Covenant of Grace

Directly related to the question of who is in the covenant is the
question of the conditionality of the covenant. Some confusion
arises over this question due to its wording. No covenant
theologian denies that faith is a condition of justification.
Therefore the question is not if there are any conditions that
someone must meet in order to be saved. Samuel Petto notes: "That
this might not be a strife of words, I could wish men would state
the question thus, Whether some evangelical duties be required of,
and graces wrought by Jesus Christ in, all the persons that are
actually interested in the new covenant"^[[7]](#note-6)^ In other
words: Is faith a condition or blessing of the Covenant of Grace?
Or: Can the Covenant of Grace be broken? Samuel Petto and John Owen
(both signers of the Savoy Declaration of Faith), among others,
argue that faith is a blessing of the Covenant of Grace that is
given to all its members. Therefore, only the elect are in the
Covenant of Grace.

Others reject this view, arguing that the Covenant of Grace is
conditional and that one can apostatize from the Covenant of Grace.
This view can be found, for example, in the PCA Book of Church
Order, which says "By virtue of being children of believing parents
they are, because of God’s covenant ordinance, made members of the
Church, but this is not sufficient to make them continue members of
the Church. When they have reached the age of discretion, they
become subject to obligations of the covenant: faith, repentance
and obedience. They then make public confession of their faith in
Christ, or become covenant breakers, and subject to the discipline
of the Church." ^[[8]](#note-7)^

### Substance of the Biblical Covenants

There is also disagreement over the substance of the Biblical
covenants. Substance refers to the essence of something and
covenant theology commonly divides a biblical covenant into its
substance and its "accidents" or non-essentials. Cornelius Venema
explains:

"In the subsequent history of Reformed covenant theology, Calvin’s
insistence upon the unity of the covenant of grace through all its
various administrations becomes a commonplace. Upon the basis of
this far-reaching formulation, Calvin consistently maintains that
all of the essential components that make the covenant of grace
what it is belong to each of its administrations. Consequently,
whatever may distinguish the Mosaic administration as a distinct
administration of the covenant of grace belong to the category of
what Calvin terms “accidental” forms that are incidental to the
covenant’s nature [such as the ceremonies]."^[[9]](#note-8)^

The
[Westminster Confession of Faith](Westminster_Confession_of_Faith "Westminster Confession of Faith")
(7.6) sees all of the historical, biblical covenants as
"administrations" of the covenant of grace. In other words, they
are all the same covenant. They are all united by the same
substance/essence.

However, this formulation, though the most common, is not held by
all. John Owen, in his commentary on Hebrews 8 said: "[W]e may
consider that the Scripture does plainly and expressly make mention
of two testaments, or covenants, and distinguish between them in
such a way as can hardly be accommodated by a twofold
administration of the same covenant…Wherefore we must grant two
distinct covenants, rather than merely a twofold administration of
the same covenant, to be intended."^[[10]](#note-9)^ Though Owen
agreed that there was only one Covenant of Grace throughout
history, he rejected the idea that all biblical covenants are
administrations of the Covenant of Grace. Instead, he argued that
only the New Covenant is the Covenant of Grace. "Having shown in
what sense the covenant of grace is called “the new covenant,” in
this distinction and opposition to the old covenant, so I shall
propose several things which relate to the nature of the first
covenant, which manifest it to have been a distinct covenant, and
not a mere administration of the covenant of
grace."^[[11]](#note-10)^

This view led Owen to revise the wording of the
[Westminster Confession of Faith](Westminster_Confession_of_Faith "Westminster Confession of Faith")
in chapter 7 for the
[Savoy Declaration](Savoy_Declaration "Savoy Declaration").
Nehemiah Coxe, the editor of the
[2nd London Baptist Confession](index.php?title=2nd_London_Baptist_Confession&action=edit&redlink=1 "2nd London Baptist Confession (page does not exist)")
stated his agreement with Owen's view and thus made his own
formulation of chapter 7 as well.^[[12]](#note-11)^

More recently, Meredith Kline has similarly challenged the
consensus view of God's covenants, specifically the Mosaic
Covenant. Kline argued that the Mosaic Covenant was superadded to
the Covenant of Grace but was distinct from it, concerned only with
temporal things, not the eternal things of the Covenant of Grace.
^[[13]](#note-12)^

## Covenant Theology and the sacraments

Since Covenant Theology today is mainly Protestant and Reformed in
its outlook, proponents view [Baptism](Baptism "Baptism") and the
[Lord's Supper](Lord's_Supper "Lord's Supper") as the only two
[sacraments](Sacraments "Sacraments").

### The Lord's Supper

The Lord's supper instituted by Jesus was a replacement for the
Jewish Passover festival. As such, it should be celebrated in much
the same way - as a symbolic participation in God's act of
salvation. In the [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament")
the Jews celebrated God's rescue from slavery in Egypt, with lamb's
blood painted on their doors to protect them from God's wrath. In
the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), this directly
refers to a celebration of God's rescue of the church from their
lives of [sin](Sin "Sin"), with the blood of Jesus as the means by
which God's New Covenant people are delivered from God's wrath.

Within the ranks of Covenant theology as a minority position, is
also the belief that as Israel's children celebrated the Passover
Meal, so too ought baptized children of believing parents today
celebrate the Lord's Supper as fellow sharers in the covenant with
God and thus, also, in the promises and blessings of the
covenant.^[[14]](#note-13)^ Cited proof texts include Matthew 19:14
and Mark 10:14.

### Baptism

Covenant Theology sees the administration of the biblical covenants
as including a principle of familial, corporate inclusion or
"generational succession." The biblical covenants between God and
man include signs and seals that visibly represent the realities
behind the covenants. These visible signs and symbols of God's
covenant redemption are administered in a corporate manner (for
instance, to households), not in an exclusively individualistic
manner.

[Baptism](Baptism "Baptism") is considered by Covenant Theologians
as the visible sign of entrance into the New Covenant and therefore
may be administered individually to new believers making a public
profession of [faith](Faith "Faith"), corporately to the households
of believers which typically would include children, or
individually to children or infants of believing parents (see
[Infant baptism](Infant_baptism "Infant baptism")). Baptism is thus
seen as the functional replacement and sacramental equivalent of
the Abrahamic rite of circumcision and symbolizes the internal
cleansing from sin, among other things.

## Criticism of Covenant Theology

Several primary weaknesses that are often attributed to Covenant
Theology as a system are that, first, it requires an allegorical
interpretation of many Scripture passages, including prophecy that
relates to God's future plans for Israel. Second, critics claim it
does not draw a sufficient distinction between the *conditional*
Mosaic covenant of the Law, the other *unconditional* covenants
established by God for Israel, and the "better covenant"
established by Jesus (cf. Hebrews 7:22; 8:6-13). Third, it equates
the nation of Israel with the New Testament Church. Fourth, the two
(and possibly three) primary covenants of Covenant Theology are no
where named in Scripture as such.
