Blomberg completed his PhD in
[Doctoral category::New Testament](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Doctoral_category::New_Testament&action=edit&redlink=1 "Doctoral category::New Testament (page does not exist)"),
specializing in the parables and the writings of Luke-Acts, at
[Aberdeen University](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Attended_university::w:Aberdeen_University&action=edit&redlink=1 "Attended university::w:Aberdeen University (page does not exist)")
in Scotland. He received the MA from
[Attended seminary::Trinity Evangelical Divinity School](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Attended_seminary::Trinity_Evangelical_Divinity_School&action=edit&redlink=1 "Attended seminary::Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (page does not exist)"),
and a BA from
[Augustana College](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Attended_college::w:Augustana_College&action=edit&redlink=1 "Attended college::w:Augustana College (page does not exist)").
Before joining the faculty of Denver Seminary, he taught at
[Taught at::Palm Beach Atlantic College](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Taught_at::Palm_Beach_Atlantic_College&action=edit&redlink=1 "Taught at::Palm Beach Atlantic College (page does not exist)")
and was a research fellow in Cambridge, England with Tyndale
House.

Craig L. Blomberg has been a New Testament scholar at Denver
Seminary in Colorado since 1986. He is currently the Distinguished
Professor of the New Testament.

He was an assistant professor of Religion at Palm Beach Atlantic
College from 1982-85 and took a leave of absence to accept a
one-year research fellowship in Cambridge, England with the British
wing of the InterVarsity Christian Fellowship from 1985-86. During
this time, he co-edited Gospel Perspectives, vol. 6: The Miracle of
Jesus and wrote The Historical Reliability of the Gospels.

Blomberg stands in the conservative evangelical tradition, but has
been known for his wide interaction with mainstream scholarship and
his willingness to challenge the evangelical status quo. For
example, he chided some evangelicals for their blanket condemnation
of Liberation Theology, and he controversially fostered a dialogue
with Mormon professor Stephen E. Robinson of BYU, which resulted in
the book
*How Wide the Divide? An Evangelical and a Mormon in Conversation*.
He was also one of several scholars interviewed for
*The Case for Christ*, a popular book by Lee Strobel.

Blomberg has written on a diverse range of issues including wealth
and poverty, parables, eschatology, hermeneutics, and women in
ministry. However, his academic work has tended to focus on the
Historical Jesus and Gospels research.

He regularly speaks and teaches at home and overseas at a variety
of churches and educational institutions. In Denver, he is involved
with Scum of the Earth Church, where his wife Fran Blomberg also
volunteers her time.
