The [Christian](Christian "Christian")
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of **creation** asserts that
[God](God "God") is the creator of all things, for "[i]n the
beginning God created the heavens and the Earth" (Gen 1:1). God
created by his word (Gen 1:3; Heb 11:3), and "[a]ll things were
made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was
made (John 1:3). While many passages show that Jesus was the agent
of creation (Col 1:16; cf 1 Cor 8:6), creation is ultimately the
work of the [triune God](Trinity "Trinity").

## Creation in Scripture

### Interpretations of the creation account

*See main page: [Interpretations of the creation account](Interpretations_of_the_creation_account "Interpretations of the creation account")*
In modern times, many different interpretations of the creation
account (recorded in Genesis 1 and 2) have been proposed. However,
this is not purely a modern concern: indeed, since the early
church, the opening chapter of Genesis has ignited controversy.

## Creation ex nihilo

Creation *ex nihilo* is the belief that [God](God "God") created
this world and the things in it out of nothing, *ex nihilo* being
Latin for "from nothing." Implicit in this
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") is the understanding that God
created man and all creatures as they are, which is in opposition
to Darwinian [evolution theory](Evolution "Evolution").
