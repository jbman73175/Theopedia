**Creation out of nothing**, or **creation ex nihilo**, is the
belief that [God](God "God") created this world out of nothing,
*ex nihilo* being Latin for "from nothing." The
[Bible](Bible "Bible") is clear that God is the creator of this
world (Gen 1:1; Job 38:1-42:6 among many others), but the issue of
*how* he created this world is what is in question. Typically there
are two main answers: (1) either God created this world from
nothing, or (2) he created this world from pre-existing matter. In
the second view God would be the *organizer* or the one who
"ordered the chaos" of this world.

## Creation as ordering

The Bible does portray God as ordering his creation. This idea is
especially clear in the image of a potter working his clay into an
ordered structure (e.g. Isaiah 29:16; Jer 18:1-6). Although not
directly associated with creating the world, this does reflect the
character of God as bringing order to his creation.

[Early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers")
such as
[Theophilus](index.php?title=Theophilus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Theophilus (page does not exist)"),
[Justin Martyr](Justin_Martyr "Justin Martyr"), and
[Origen](Origen "Origen") actually believed that matter was
pre-existent with God. Borrowed from
[platonic thought](index.php?title=Platonism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Platonism (page does not exist)"),
these church fathers believed that God "ordered" this chaotic
matter and gave it its shape and form, thus resulting in the
creation of the world. As
[McGrath](Alister_McGrath "Alister McGrath") notes, "[m]atter was
already present within the universe, and did not require to be
created; it needed to be given a definite shape and structure"
(McGrath, *Theology*, p. 38). There are many problems associated
with this view (see below), and this is why by the fourth century
most Christian theologians rejected this view.

## The battle for creation out of nothing

The [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of creation ex nihilo was
mostly developed due to the rising pressure of
[Gnosticism](Gnosticism "Gnosticism"). This view drew a distinction
between the God of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament"), the one they
believed had created this world, and the God of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), the one they
believed had redeemed this world. The God of the OT was also
regarded as a lesser deity than the God of the NT.

[Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") (130-200) responded, arguing not
only against the Gnostic teaching of two Gods, but even more
against Greek philosophy which taught that matter had pre-existed
and that God became the divine architect as he ordered this
pre-existent matter. Irenaeus argued that "[t]here was no
preexistent matter; everything required to be created out of
nothing" (McGrath, p. 38).

[Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian") (160-225) later argued that
the world depended on God for its existence. This was in contrast
to the Aristotelian view that the world depended on nothing. Both
the Aristotelian and the Platonic view were at war with the early
Christians, but by the fourth century, "most Christian theologians
rejected the Platonist approach, even in the form associated with
Origen, and argued for God being the creator of both the spiritual
and material worlds" (McGrath, 39).

[Colin Gunton](Colin_Gunton "Colin Gunton"), one of the greatest
British systematic theologians of the 20th century, writes that
"...God is not to be likened, let us say, to a potter who makes a
pot from the clay which is to hand; he is, rather, like one who
makes both the clay and the pot. This teaching, which baffles
understanding and is often rejected because there is no analogy to
it in human experience, must be understood as an interpretation and
summary of scripture’s witness to God as a whole,"
(*The Christian Faith*, p. 17).

## Biblical understanding

The Bible does not explicitly state the term "out of nothing"
regarding creation. However, biblical scholars do believe that the
totality of Scripture does in fact teach this. Looking at such
passages as Genesis 1:1ff, Psalms 33:6, Psalms 148:5, John 1:3,
Colossians 1:16, and Hebrews 11:3 gives a more complete picture of
how God created the world. Viewing the entire biblical account has
allowed theologians to conclude with this interpretation.
