## Creeds in the Bible

There are numerous passages of Scripture which are considered by
many to essentially qualify as creeds or declarations of faith. The
following are examples:

-   ["The Lord our God, the Lord is one"](Monotheism "Monotheism")
    (Deut 6:4, 1 Cor 8:4)
-   [Jesus is Lord](Jesus_is_Lord "Jesus is Lord") (Romans 10:9 ,
    Phil 2:11)
-   Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was
    manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels,
    proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in
    glory, (1 Tim. 3:16, ESV).
-   "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life,
    and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy
    One of God," (John 6:68-69, ESV).
-   For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also
    received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the
    Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day
    in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas,
    then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred
    brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some
    have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the
    apostles, (1 Cor. 15:3-7, ESV).
-   By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses
    that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, (1 John 4:2,
    ESV).
