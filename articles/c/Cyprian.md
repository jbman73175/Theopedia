**Cyprian** (ca. 200 - 258), also known as **Cyprian of Carthage**,
was bishop of Carthage and one of the major theologians of the
early North African Church. He was born in North Africa, perhaps at
Carthage, where he received an excellent secular education. Having
converted to Christianity, he became a bishop (c. 248) and
eventually died a martyr at Carthage. A
[biography](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf05.iv.iii.html) has
survived that was written by Pontius the Deacon.

"Cyprian was forced to flee Carthage during the persecutions of
Emperor Decius from 249 to 251. Upon his return he addressed the
problem of Christians who had failed to stand firm during the
persecution. Cyprian favored the readmission of such Christians to
the church but under stringent conditions. Opposing the schism of
Novatian, who believed that lapsed Christians should be permanently
excluded, he argued that baptisms performed by the schismatics were
invalid. On this issue he was opposed by Pope Stephen I. In the
renewed persecution of Valerian's reign, Cyprian was beheaded not
far from Carthage.

"Cyprian's writing reflects the influence of
[Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian"), whom he held in high esteem.
His best-known work is *De ecclesiae unitate*
([[1]](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf05.iv.v.i.html)On the
Unity of the Church), in which he stressed the role of the bishop
in deciding local church matters, although he gave the Roman church
a position of preeminence."
