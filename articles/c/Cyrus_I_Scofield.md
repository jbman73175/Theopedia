was an American theologian, minister and author of the Scofield
Reference Bible.

## Biographical Sketch

Scofield was born in Lenawee County, Michigan, on August 19, 1843.
He studied law in St. Louis, Missouri and moved to Topeka, Kansas,
where he was admitted to the bar in 1869. He was a member of the
[Member of::Kansas legislature](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Member_of::Kansas_legislature&action=edit&redlink=1 "Member of::Kansas legislature (page does not exist)")
in 1870-71 and was appointed United States district attorney for
Kansas in 1873 under the administration of President Ulysses S.
Grant. However, in his legal career, Scofield began drinking
heavily and ran up substantial debts. He was replaced as U.S.
attorney and served a brief jail sentence for forgery in 1879.

While in jail, Scofield underwent a religious conversion and became
a Christian. As a neophyte Christian, Scofield was profoundly
influenced and indeed schooled by
[Influenced by::James H. Brookes](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Influenced_by::James_H._Brookes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Influenced by::James H. Brookes (page does not exist)"),
the minister of Walnut Street Presbyterian Church, St. Louis also
known as "The Father of American
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism")."
Brookes helped Scofield in his study of the Bible and introduced
him to
[dispensational teaching](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Proponent_of::Dispensationalism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Proponent of::Dispensationalism (page does not exist)").

In 1883 Scofield was ordained as a Congregationalist minister and
at the encouragement of Brookes accepted a pastorship of the
[Pastor of::First Congregational Church](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Pastor_of::First_Congregational_Church&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pastor of::First Congregational Church (page does not exist)")
in Dallas Texas. Scofield was called as an associate pastor of
[Associate pastor of::Moody Church](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Associate_pastor_of::Moody_Church&action=edit&redlink=1 "Associate pastor of::Moody Church (page does not exist)"),
Northfield, Massachusetts from 1895-1902, returning to his Dallas
church from 1902-1907. He spent his later years lecturing on
biblical subjects on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1914, Scofield,
with William Pettingill and the assistance of
[Lewis Sperry Chafer](Lewis_Sperry_Chafer "Lewis Sperry Chafer"),
established the
[President of::Philadelphia School of the Bible](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=President_of::Philadelphia_School_of_the_Bible&action=edit&redlink=1 "President of::Philadelphia School of the Bible (page does not exist)")
and served as its first president.

## Biblical studies

Scofield developed a correspondence Bible study course that became
the basis of the work for which he is chiefly remembered, the
*Scofield Reference Bible*, a widely circulated and popular
annotated study Bible that was first published in 1909 by Oxford
University Press. This Bible teaches the theology of
dispensationalism devised in the nineteenth century by
[John Nelson Darby](John_Nelson_Darby "John Nelson Darby"), and it
was largely through the influence of Scofield's notes on the Bible
that dispensationalism became influential among fundamentalist
Christians in the U.S.A.

This belief system sees a distinction between the Church described
in the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") and the
promises made by [God](God "God") in the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") to ancient Israel â€”
i.e. there are two peoples of God with two different destinies,
ethnic Israel (OT) contrasted to the spiritual church (NT). Some
see it as one of the intellectual foundations of Christian Zionism,
a belief that Christians are obliged to support the Jewish state of
modern Israel (as the people of God) not only as a matter of
morality but as an item of [faith](Faith "Faith").

Scofield's work was based upon the
[King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version"), but
in recent years his notes have been updated and applied to the
[New International Version](New_International_Version "New International Version")
and others. His study Bible has now greatly influenced several
generations of [evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism")
pastors. Although his ideas have gained widespread acceptance in
evangelical circles their acceptance is far from universal.

#### Quotation:

"Optimists" patter of peace when there is no peace, and will not
see that the evils from which the philosophers would save us are as
old as the human race itself. Every method whereby the race has
sought to realize the deathless vision has been tried to the dregs,
and has failed. The futility of the ideal commonwealth of Plato and
the others is precisely the futility of all superficial optimism
--- the notion that for the common good, men are going to give up
ambition, greed, and pride. But that which has sought expression in
the Utopias, stands boldly forth in Scripture as a revealed purpose
of God. *What do the Prophets Say*, (1918).
