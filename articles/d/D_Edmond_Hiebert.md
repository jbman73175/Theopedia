**D. Edmond Hiebert** (1928-1995) was professor emeritus of New
Testament at Mennonite Brethren Biblical Seminary in Fresno,
California. Hiebert received his Th.M. from Southern Baptist
Theological Seminary in 1939 and his Th.D. from there in 1942.

"Upon completion of his doctoral studies, Hiebert returned to
Hillsboro, Kansas, where had been appointed Professor of New
Testament at Tabor College. Soon thereafter the Hieberts rejoined
the Mennonite Brethren Church. Hiebert contracted undulant fever in
1944, from which he nearly died. Several months after his apparent
recovery, it became evident that he was losing his hearing, and by
1946 Hiebert was completely deaf. Following a recurrence of his
illness, Hiebert resumed teaching at Tabor in fall of 1947. In 1955
Hiebert joined the faculty of the newly-established Mennonite
Brethren Biblical Seminary in Fresno, California. He served as a
professor of New Testament there from 1955 to 1975. In 1975 he was
named Professor Emeritus at MBBS, and continued to teach on a
part-time basis there until 1985. Despite his deafness, Hiebert was
a successful and respected lecturer in New Testament studies during
his long career at Tabor and
MBBS."[[1]](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf8m3nb2q1)
