## Criticism

Willard is a philosopher, not a theologian. An example of his
sloppy theology may be seen in the quote below which implies (1)
one can earn salvation, and (2) one may be saved without knowing
Christ:

-   "What Paul is clearly saying is that if anyone is worthy of
    being saved, they will be saved. At that point many Christians get
    very anxious, saying that absolutely no one is worthy of being
    saved. The implication of that is that a person can be almost
    totally good, but miss the message about Jesus, and be sent to
    hell. What kind of a God would do that? I am not going to stand in
    the way of anyone whom God wants to save. I am not going to say "he
    can't save them." I am happy for God to save anyone he wants in any
    way he can. It is possible for someone who does not know Jesus to
    be saved. But anyone who is going to be saved is going to be saved
    by Jesus: There is no other name given under heaven by which men
    can be saved." -
