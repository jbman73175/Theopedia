Young captive taken to [Babylon](Babylon "Babylon") by
[Nebuchadnezzar](index.php?title=Nebuchadnezzar&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nebuchadnezzar (page does not exist)").
He eventually became a powerful political figure.

In Hebrew his name is דניאל (pronounced: dah-nee-ayl). This is a
compound word meaning, "God is my judge." It comes from the words
דני (my judge) and אל (God).

Daniel lived under circumstances and his devotion to principle and
prayer appears at several points in the story of his life.

In Daniel 1:17-19, we see Daniel desiring "mercies of the God of
heaven" that he might know Nebuchadnezzar's dream and the
interpretation of it.

In Daniel 6:6-10, we see Daniel maintaining his devotion to prayer
at the risk of his life and indeed he was subsequently delivered
over to the lion's den.

In Daniel 9, we see Daniel's extensive prayer for his nation of
Israel.

The excellent spirit of light and wisdom and understanding in
Daniel as well as the mighty providential workings of Almighty God
in his life are evidences of the extent of his prayers and devotion
to God.
