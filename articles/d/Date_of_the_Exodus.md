The **Exodus of Israel** was the event described in the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") when the Hebrews left Egyptian slavery for
the Promised Land under the leadership of [Moses](Moses "Moses").
The actual date with which this event took place has been the
subject of serious study, speculation, and controversy. Currently,
debate has centered on two dates: an early date of 1441 B.C.; and a
late date of 1290 B.C.

## Conditions prior to the Hebrew slavery

The
[Hyksos](index.php?title=Hyksos&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hyksos (page does not exist)"),
a word from the Egyptian language meaning "rulers of foreign lands"
were a Semitic/Asiatic people who invaded the Delta region of
northern Egypt about 1720 B.C., making their capitol at Avaris.
They ruled Egypt as the 15th Dynasty, and were listed as legitimate
kings on the Turin Papyrus, but their rule did not interfere with
Egyptian control or politics of the south. They introduced the
chariot and the bow, improved battle axes, and better techniques of
fortification. Their rule may have been somewhat harsh, as they may
have been hated by the Egyptian population as a whole. The Egyptian
revolt began under Khamose, and Avaris fell under Ahmose about 1550
B.C., using against them many of the same military weapons and
tactics introduced by the Hyksos. The powerful 18th Dynasty was
founded by Amenhotep I (1546-1525 B.C.), who came to power after
the Hyksos campaign. (Unger, pg. 508)

## Evidence for pre-Exodus slavery

Remaining Semites who stayed behind after the Hyksos were driven
out were treated brutally by the next several kings (Thutmose I and
Thutmose II), culminating in Thutmose III, who
*"...made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field..."*
(*Exodus* 1:14). Thutmose III was known as "the Napoleon of Egypt",
and who set about conquering large swaths of territory once
occupied by the Hyksos and their allies. He was also a great
builder who used many slaves in his building projects; the
population of slaves included large numbers of Semites, who were
hated by Thutmose as a result of the Hyksos period. Archaeologist
and historian W.F. Albright confirmed that the Hyksos invasion of
Egypt was led by a Semetic people, not Hurrians or Indo-Aryans as
some scholars contend; the fact that the remaining population was
Semetic help fuel the hatred that many Egyptians felt for the
Hebrew slaves remaining in Goshen. (Albright, pg. 44)

Rekhmire, the
[vizier](index.php?title=Vizier&action=edit&redlink=1 "Vizier (page does not exist)")
to Thutmose III, left behind splended wall paintings in his tomb in
which scenes of the making of bricks and other tasks are being
carried out, similar to the scene in *Exodus* 5:6-19. Found among
the figures in the paintings are Semitic foreigners engaged in
brick-making, with the hyroglyphic text having them say
*"He supplies us with bread, beer, and every good thing,"* while
they get a stern warning from the task-masters:
*"The rod is in my hand; be not idle!* (Unger, pg. 333)

## Early date of 1441 B.C.

The early date of 1441 B.C. places the Exodus under the reign of
Pharaoh Amenhotep II of the 18th Dynasty, and many scholars contend
that this is the correct Biblical date. This has been denied by
some scholars citing *Exodus* 1:11 and other evidence; however, a
careful survey of the Biblical narrative for the Exodus up until
the time of Solomon, in addition to extra-Biblical evidence, places
the Exodus event during the the mid-1400s B.C., rather then more
than a century later.

*1st Kings* 6:1 states that Solomon began to build the Temple
*"in the 480th year after the children of Israel were come up out of the land of Egypt,"*
which was during the fourth year of his reign, or about 961 B.C.
This agrees with modern archaeologists who established a rough
timeframe for Solomon's kingship (Albright, 958 B.C.; Thiele, 967
B.C., etc), making the date of the Exodus to have been about 1441
B.C. This date fits the timeframe as established by the Biblical
narrative, and chronologists attempting to establish the later date
of 1290 B.C. must thoroughly reject the *1st Kings* verse, and by
extention reject the chronology of the narrative in *Judges* and
the early kingships in Israel as not being able to fit within
contemporary history of that time. (Unger, pg. 332)

Contemporary history of Egyptian events also supports the 1441 B.C.
date. The pharaoh who refused to allow the Hebrews to leave most
certainly would have been Amenhotep II, who reigned c. 1450-1425
B.C. He was the son of the empire builder and conqueror Thutmose
III, and Amenhotep lived off his father's largesse. It is also
clear from Egyptian inscriptions that the son who succeeded him to
the throne, Thutmose IV, was not his first born; this was indicated
by the inscription on a slab known as the
[Dream Stele](index.php?title=Dream_Stele&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dream Stele (page does not exist)")
at the foot of the Great Sphinx which states that the god Amun
would give him the throne if he cleared away the sand from the feet
of the Sphinx and restore it:

-   *"One of those days it came to pass that the king's son, Thutmose, came, coursing at the time of midday, and he rested in the shadow of this great god. A vision of sleep seized him at the hour (when) the sun was in the zenith, and he found the majesty of this revered god speaking with his own mouth, as a father speaks with his son, saying: "Behold thou me! See thou me! My son Thutmose. I am thy father, Harmakhis-Khepri-Re-Atum, who will give to thee my kingdom on earth at the head of the living. Thou shalt wear the white crown and the red crown upon the throne of Keb, the hereditary prince. The land shall be thine in its length and breadth, that which the eye of the All-Lord shines upon. The food of the Two Lands shall be thine, the great tribute of all countries, the duration of a long period of years."*

### The Amarna Letters

The
[Amarna Letters](index.php?title=Amarna_Letters&action=edit&redlink=1 "Amarna Letters (page does not exist)"),
named for Pharaoh
[Akenaton](index.php?title=Akenaton&action=edit&redlink=1 "Akenaton (page does not exist)")'s
city where they were discovered in 1886, provide a glimpse into the
details of an invasion of the land of Canaan by a people called the
"Haibiru" or "Hapiru"; although some are divided on the matter,
many agree that the "Haibiru" are actually the Hebrews just
entering the Promised Land and putting fear into the vassals of
Egypt in the area.
[[2]](http://www.terraflex.co.il/ad/egypt/a-abdu-heba1.htm) The
letters date from c. 1400-1366, corresponding to the entry of
[Joshua](Joshua "Joshua") according to the Biblical timeframe.

### David Rohl

Egyptologist and historian David Rohl created a stir when he
published a
[New Chronology](index.php?title=New_Chronology&action=edit&redlink=1 "New Chronology (page does not exist)")
in 1995, essentially re-writing Egyptian history because he
believes it was off by approximately 125 years as a result of
mistakes made by archaeologists during the late 19th century. While
not far off with his date of the Exodus (1447 B.C.), he stated in
his book that the pharaoh of the Oppression was Khenefere
Sobekhotep IV, and the pharaoh of the Exodus was Dudimose; this
based on the writings of a Jewish historian named Artapanus, who
wrote *Peri Ioudaion* (*Concerning the Jews*), and was cited by the
early church historian Eusebius, as well as consulting
[Josephus](Josephus "Josephus") in his *Antiquities of the Jews*
(Rohl, pg. 252-280).

## Late date of 1290 B.C.

The late date of 1290 B.C. places the Exodus under the reign of
Rameses II of the 19th Dynasty. This is reasoned by scholars based
on the following objections:

-   *It is improbable that Israel would have entered Egypt before the Hyksos period*.
    Countering this argument, it is stated that Abraham entered Egypt
    and moved about the land rather freely, including personal
    encounters with the pharoah during the Middle Kingdom (Gen.
    13:10-12); Joseph also was in Egypt prior to the Hyksos, as
    indicated by the Genesis narrative containing a strong Egyptian,
    and not Hyksos, style in the writing. There is also the fact that
    the Hebrews, when they settled in Goshen, were segragated from the
    Egyptians due to the fact that
    *"every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians"* (Gen. 46:34),
    something which under a Hyksos king would not have happened.
    (Unger, pg. 333)
-   *The Biblical statement of Exodus 1:11 is supposed to place the event at 1290 B.C.*
    This verse reads
    *"...and they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses"*,
    possibly indicating the reign of Rameses II during this time. The
    fact that the site of the city of Raamses was only called that from
    1300 to 100 B.C. is not a settled argument in favor of the earlier
    date, as the site previously was known as "Zoan-Avaris" where the
    Israelites had served as slaves years before. Zoan-Avaris also
    flourished before the Hyksos were driven out at approximately 1570
    B.C., leaving plenty of time for the Hebrew slaves to have built
    the earlier city after they arrived in c. 1870 B.C. during the time
    of Joseph (Unger, pg. 333).
-   *The earlier date of the Exodus is disputed by evidence from Transjordan, Debir, and Lachish.*
    The explorations of archaeologist Nelson Gleck demonstrated a gap
    in the population of this region between 1900-1300 B.C., which
    according to Gleck indicated that had the Israelites came up from
    Egypt during the Exodus, they would not have met the Amorites,
    Moabites, and Edomites which resisted their journey. However, there
    is nothing in the *Exodus* story demanding more than a simple,
    farming economy which left behind little to no evidence for the
    archaeologist, nor is there any evidence found at Lachish and Debir
    sufficient enough to set aside the *Exodus* narrative. (Unger, pp.
    333-334)
