"The antidote to disfunctional relationships is not to encourage
singles to just ‘get out there and dig in’, but to encourage them
to dive into service within their local church, to take advantage
of this season of life to follow hard after God and to think and
pray through those characteristics that they value in a mate. Let’s
be honest - dating is about marriage… even unbelievers recognize
that at some distorted level." -Matthew Hall
