## "What Love is This?"

Hunt is also the author of the controversial book entitled,
*What Love Is This? Calvinism's Misrepresentation of God*, which
carries the following description:

"Multitudes of sincere, Bible-believing Christians seem to have
accepted Calvinism by default, thinking that their only choice is
between a doctrine of
[eternal security](Eternal_security "Eternal security") and a
doctrine of falling away. How aware are they of what
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") and his early followers of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries actually believed and
practiced? Bestselling author and scholar Dave Hunt warns readers
about the distorted beliefs of Calvinism, giving them a clearer
view of the God whose sovereignty does not diminish His mercy and
love."
This book has brought criticism from both Arminian and Calvinist
camps, each claiming Hunt has seriously misrepresented their
respective theological positions.

## Quotations from "What Love is This?"

-   "According to Calvin, salvation had nothing to do with whether
    or not a person believed the gospel." (p. 42)
-   "Calvin drew from a badly polluted stream when he embraced the
    teachings of Augustine! How could one dip into such contaminating
    heresy without becoming confused and infected?" (p. 51)
-   "Calvin exerted authority much like the papacy which he now
    despised." (p. 63)
-   "Today there is growing division on this issue, most Calvinists
    insisting that Christ died only for the elect. On the other hand,
    IFCA International, a group of about 700 independent evangelical
    churches and 1,200 pastors (some of them Calvinists) declares in
    its doctrinal statement, 'We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ
    died on the cross for all mankind...to accomplish the redemption of
    all who trust in him...."
-   Calvin's *Institutes* "could not possibly have come from a deep
    and fully developed evangelical understanding of Scripture."
-   Spurgeon "could not accept the teaching that regeneration came
    before faith in Christ through the gospel."
