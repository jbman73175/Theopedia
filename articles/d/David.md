**King David**, was the second king of the united kingdom of Israel
(c. 1005 BC - 965 BC) and successor to
[King Saul](index.php?title=King_Saul&action=edit&redlink=1 "King Saul (page does not exist)").
His life and rule are recorded in the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") books of
[1 Samuel](Books_of_Samuel "Books of Samuel") (from chapter 16
onwards), [2 Samuel](Books_of_Samuel "Books of Samuel"),
[1 Kings](Books_of_Kings "Books of Kings") and
[2 Kings](Books_of_Kings "Books of Kings") (to verse 4).
[1 Chronicles](Books_of_Chronicles "Books of Chronicles") gives
further stories of David, mingled with lists and genealogies.

He is depicted as the most righteous of all the ancient kings of
Israel - although not without fault - as well as an acclaimed
warrior, musician and poet (he is traditionally credited with the
authorship of many of the [Psalms](Psalms "Psalms")). 2 Samuel
7:12-16 states that [God](God "God") was so pleased with David that
He promised that the Davidic line would endure forever.
[Jews](Judaism "Judaism") therefore believe that the Jewish
[Messiah](Messiah "Messiah") will be a direct descendant of King
David, and [Christians](Christianity "Christianity") trace the
lineage of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") back to him through both
[Mary](Mary "Mary"), the mother of Jesus, and her husband
[Joseph](Joseph "Joseph"). The nature of his reign and even his
existence have been questioned and debated, rejected and defended
by modern biblical scholars, but the account given in the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") remains widely
accepted by the majority of Jews and Christians, and his story has
been of central importance to Western culture.

## Early Years (1 Samuel 16)

David was born in
[Bethlehem](index.php?title=Bethlehem&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bethlehem (page does not exist)")
as the youngest of eight sons to
[Jesse](index.php?title=Jesse&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jesse (page does not exist)"),
a descendant of
[Judah](index.php?title=Judah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Judah (page does not exist)").
He was assigned to look after the family's flock of sheep. He was
anointed as the future king by the prophet
[Samuel](index.php?title=Samuel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Samuel (page does not exist)"),
after God had overlooked his older brothers. David's first act of
service was to play the lyre for King Saul whenever the evil spirit
from God tormented him. He quickly found favor with Saul and was
assigned to be his armor-bearer.

## Friendship with Jonathan (1 Samuel 18)

David's close personal friendship with Jonathan began shortly after
the victory over the Philistines (1 Sam 18:1)

## The Bathsheba Affair (2 Samuel 11)

Late one afternoon, David was walking on the roof of the king's
house, when he saw
[Bathsheba](index.php?title=Bathsheba&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bathsheba (page does not exist)")
bathing. He was attracted to her and had her brought to him. In
order to cover up the affair, David sent Bathsheba's husband
[Uriah](index.php?title=Uriah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Uriah (page does not exist)")
to the front lines where he was killed.
