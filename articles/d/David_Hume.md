**David Hume** (1711-1776) generally regarded as the most important
[philosopher](Philosophy "Philosophy") ever to write in English --
the last of the great triumvirate of "British empiricists" -- was
also noted as an historian and essayist. A master stylist in any
genre, Hume's major philosophical works --
*A Treatise of Human Nature* (1739-1740), the
*Enquiries concerning Human Understanding* (1748) and
*Concerning the Principles of Morals* (1751), as well as the
posthumously published *Dialogues concerning Natural Religion*
(1779) -- remain widely and deeply influential, despite their being
denounced by many of his contemporaries as works of scepticism and
atheism. While Hume's influence is evident in the moral philosophy
and economic writings of his close friend Adam Smith, he also
awakened Immanuel Kant from his "dogmatic slumbers" and "caused the
scales to fall" from Jeremy Bentham's eyes. Charles Darwin counted
Hume as a central influence, as did "Darwin's bulldog," Thomas
Henry Huxley. The diverse directions in which these writers took
what they gleaned from reading Hume reflect not only the richness
of their sources but also the wide range of Hume's empiricism.
Comtemporary philosophers recognize Hume as one of the most
thoroughgoing exponents of philosophical naturalism.

### The design argument

One of the oldest and most popular
[arguments for the existence of God](Existence_of_God "Existence of God")
is
[the design argument](index.php?title=Teleological_argument&action=edit&redlink=1 "Teleological argument (page does not exist)")
â€“ that all the order and 'purpose' in the world bespeaks a divine
origin. A modern manifestation of this belief is
[creationism](Creationism "Creationism"). Hume gave the classic
criticism of the design argument in
*[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion](index.php?title=Dialogues_Concerning_Natural_Religion&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (page does not exist)")*
and
*[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding](index.php?title=An_Enquiry_Concerning_Human_Understanding&action=edit&redlink=1 "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (page does not exist)")*
and though the issue is far from dead in modern debate, many are
convinced that Hume killed the argument for good. Here are some of
his points:

1.  For the design argument to be feasible, it must be true that
    order and purpose are observed only when they result from design.
    But order is observed regularly, resulting from presumably mindless
    processes like snowflake or crystal generation. Design accounts for
    only a tiny part of our experience with order and 'purpose'.
2.  Furthermore, the design argument is based on an incomplete
    analogy: because of our experience with objects, we can recognise
    human-designed ones, comparing for example a pile of stones and a
    brick wall. But in order to point to a designed Universe, we would
    need to have an experience of a range of different universes. As we
    only experience one, the analogy cannot be applied.
3.  Even if the design argument is completely successful, it could
    not (in and of itself) establish a robust theism; one could easily
    reach the conclusion that the universe's configuration is the
    result of some morally ambiguous, possibly unintelligent agent or
    agents whose method bears only a remote similarity to human design.
4.  If a well-ordered natural world requires a special designer,
    then God's mind (being so well-ordered) *also* requires a special
    designer. And then this designer would likewise need a designer,
    and so on *ad infinitum*. We could respond by resting content with
    an inexplicably self-ordered divine mind; but then why not rest
    content with an inexplicably self-ordered natural world?
5.  Often, what appears to be purpose, where it looks like object X
    has feature F in order to secure some outcome O, is better
    explained by a filtering process: that is, object X wouldn't be
    around did it not possess feature F, and outcome O is only
    interesting to us as a human projection of goals onto nature. This
    mechanical explanation of
    [teleology](index.php?title=Teleology&action=edit&redlink=1 "Teleology (page does not exist)")
    anticipated
    [natural selection](index.php?title=Natural_selection&action=edit&redlink=1 "Natural selection (page does not exist)").
