## The Cambridge Declaration

"Both the conference and the eventual declaration came about as a
result of David F. Wells' 1993 book
*No Place for Truth or Whatever Happened to Evangelical Theology?*
([ISBN 080280747X](http://www.theopedia.com/Special:BookSources/080280747X)).
This book was highly critical of the Evangelical church in America
for abandoning its historical and theological roots, and instead
embracing the philosophies and pragmatism of the world."

"While not a best seller, the book was critically acclaimed by a
number of important Evangelical leaders. In 1994 a number of these
leaders formed the
[Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals](Alliance_of_Confessing_Evangelicals "Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals").
Since much of Wells' thesis stemmed from the modern church's
abandonment of historical confessions of faith (such as The
Westminster Confession and the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith),
the Alliance was based upon Evangelicals who not only adhered to
these Reformed confessions of faith, but were able to direct their
ministries accordingly." ^[[2]](#note-1)^
