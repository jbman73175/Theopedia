The **Davidic Covenant**, found in
[2 Samuel](Books_of_Samuel "Books of Samuel") 7, establishing
[David](David "David") and his lineage as the rightful kings of
Israel and Judah and extends the covenant of
[Abraham](Abraham "Abraham") to David's lineage.

The Davidic Covenant is an important element of
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")' claim to be the
[Messiah](Messiah "Messiah"). Jesus, by his death and
[atonement](Atonement "Atonement") created a
[New covenant](New_covenant "New covenant") of faith in which
Gentiles as well as Israelites could participate, and under which
God promised to grant the faithful
[eternal life](Eternal_life "Eternal life").
