The **Dead Sea Scrolls** comprise roughly 850 documents, including
texts from the Hebrew Bible, discovered between 1947 and 1956 in
eleven caves in and around the Wadi Qumran -- near the ruins of the
ancient settlement of Khirbet Qumran, on the northwest shore of the
Dead Sea. The texts are of great significance in a religious
context as they contain biblical documents dating from before AD
100.

## Date and contents

According to carbon dating and textual analysis, the documents were
written at various times between the middle of the 2nd century BC
and the 1st century AD. At least one document has a carbon date
range of 21 BC - AD 61. The Nash Papyrus from Egypt, containing a
copy of the Ten Commandments, is the only other Hebrew document of
comparable antiquity. Similar written materials have been recovered
from nearby sites, including the fortress of Masada. While some of
the scrolls were written on papyrus, a good portion were written on
a brownish animal skin (hide) that appears to be
[gevil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gevil "w:gevil").

The fragments include at least 800 texts that represent many
diverse writings ranging from the beliefs of the
[Essenes](Essenes "Essenes") to those of other sects. About 30% are
fragments from the Hebrew Bible, from all the books except the Book
of [Esther](Book_of_Esther "Book of Esther"). About 25% are
traditional Jewish religious texts that are not in the canonical
Hebrew Bible, such as the Book of Enoch and the Testament of Levi].
Another 30% contain biblical commentaries or other texts related to
the beliefs, regulations, and membership requirements of a small
Jewish sect, which is believed by many researchers to have lived in
the Qumran area. The rest (about 15%) of the fragments are yet
unidentified. Most of them are written in Hebrew, but also some
written in [Aramaic](Aramaic "Aramaic"), and a few in Greek.

Important texts include the
[Isaiah](Book_of_Isaiah "Book of Isaiah") Scroll (discovered in
1947), a Commentary on the
[Habakkuk](Book_of_Habakkuk "Book of Habakkuk") (1947), the
Community Rule (1QS), which gives much information on the structure
and theology of the sect, and the earliest version of the Damascus
Document. The so-called Copper Scroll (1952), which lists hidden
caches of gold, scrolls, and weapons, is probably the most
notorious.
