**Decisionism** in Christianity is the belief that a person is
saved by coming forward, raising the hand, saying a prayer,
believing a doctrine, making a lordship commitment, or some other
external, human act, which is taken as the equivalent to, and proof
of, the miracle of inward conversion. It is believed that a person
is saved through the mere means of external decision and that
performing one of these human actions also gives sufficient
evidence of regeneration. Many who do not use an "invitation" still
hold a form of "decisionism" that Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones called
"Sandemanianism" (Banner of Truth Trust, 1987, "Puritans: Their
Origins and Successors").

In contrast, [Conversion](Conversion "Conversion") is the result of
that work of the Holy Spirit which draws a lost sinner to Jesus
Christ for justification and regeneration, and changes the sinner's
standing before God from lost to saved, imparting divine life to
the depraved soul, thus producing a new direction in the life of
the convert. The objective side of salvation is justification. The
subjective side of salvation is regeneration. The result is
conversion.
