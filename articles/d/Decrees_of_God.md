## The Concept of God's Decree in Scripture

The word "decree" is found in Psalm 2:7, etc. In Ephesians 3:11 we
read of His "eternal purpose." In Acts 2:23 of His "determinate
counsel and foreknowledge." In Ephesians 1:9 of the mystery of His
"will." In Romans 8:29 that He also did predestinate. In Ephesians
1:9 of His "good pleasure." God’s decrees are called His "counsel"
to signify they are consummately wise. They are called God’s "will"
to show He was under no control, but acted according to His own
pleasure. When a man’s will is the rule of his conduct, it is
usually capricious and unreasonable; but wisdom is always
associated with "will" in the Divine proceedings, and accordingly,
God’s decrees are said to be "the counsel of His own will" (Eph.
1:11).

## The Divine Decree is *Singular*

Though we often speak of the decrees of God in the plural, yet in
its own nature the divine decree is but a single act of God. This
is already suggested by the fact that the Bible speaks of it as a
*prothesis*, a purpose or counsel. It follows also from the very
nature of God. His knowledge is all immediate and simultaneous
rather than successive like ours, and His comprehension of it is
always complete. And the decree that is founded on it is also a
single, all-comprehensive, and simultaneous act. As an eternal and
immutable decree it could not be otherwise. There is, therefore, no
series of decrees in God, but simply one comprehensive plan,
embracing all that comes to pass. Our finite comprehension,
however, constrains us to make distinctions, and this accounts for
the fact that we often speak of the decrees of God in the plural.
This manner of speaking is perfectly legitimate, provided we do not
lose sight of the unity of the divine decree, and of the
inseparable connection of the various decrees as we conceive of
them.

The decree of God is His purpose or determination with respect to
future things. We have used the singular number as Scripture does
(Rom 8:28, Eph 3:11), because there was only one act of His
infinite mind about future things. But we speak as if there had
been many, because our minds are only capable of thinking of
successive revolutions, as thoughts and occasions arise, or in
reference to the various objects of His decree, which being many
seem to us to require a distinct purpose for each one. But an
infinite understanding does not proceed by steps, from one stage to
another: "Known unto God are all His works, from the beginning of
the world" (Acts 15:18).

## God's Decrees Concern Everything

The decrees of God relate to all future things without exception:
whatever is done in time, was foreordained before time began. God’s
purpose was concerned with everything, whether great or small,
whether good or evil, although with reference to the latter we must
be careful to state that while God is the Orderer and Controller of
sin, He is not the Author of it in the same way that He is the
Author of good. Sin could not proceed from a holy God by positive
and direct creation, but only by decretive permission and negative
action. God’s decree is as comprehensive as His government,
extending to all creatures and all events. It was concerned about
our life and death; about our state in time, and our state in
eternity. As God works all things after the counsel of His own
will, we learn from His works what His counsel is (was), as we
judge of an architect’s plan by inspecting the building which was
erected under his directions.

## God's Decrees Are Comprehensive

God did not merely decree to make man, place him upon the earth,
and then leave him to his own uncontrolled guidance; instead, He
fixed all the circumstances in the lot of individuals, and all the
particulars which will comprise the history of the human race from
its commencement to its close. He did not merely decree that
general laws should be established for the government of the world,
but He settled the application of those laws to all particular
cases. Our days are numbered, and so are the hairs of our heads. We
may learn what is the extent of the Divine decrees from the
dispensations of providence, in which they are executed. The care
of Providence reaches to the most insignificant creatures, and the
most minute events—the death of a sparrow, and the fall of a hair.

-   The Scriptures assert this of the whole system in general
    embraced in the divine decrees. Dan. 4:34, 35; Acts 17:26; Eph
    1:11.
-   They affirm the same of fortuitous events. Prov. 16:33; Matt.
    10:29, 30.
-   Also of the free actions of men. Eph. 2:10, 11; Phil. 2:13.
-   Even the wicked actions of men. Acts 2:23; 4:27, 28; 13:29; 1
    Pet. 2:8; Jude 4; Rev. 17:17. As to the history of Joseph, compare
    Gen. 37:28, with Gen. 45:7, 8, and Gen. 50:20. See also Ps. 17:13,
    14; Isa. 10:5, 15.

## God's decrees are eternal

Acts 15:18; Eph. 1:4; 3:11; 1 Pet. 1:20; 2 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 1:9;
1 Cor. 2:7.

To suppose any of them to be made in time, is to suppose that some
new occasion has occurred, some unforeseen event or combination of
circumstances has arisen, which has induced the Most High to form a
new resolution. This would argue that the knowledge of the deity is
limited, an that He is growing wiser in the progress of time—which
would be horrible blasphemy. No man who believes that the Divine
understanding is infinite, comprehending the past, the present, and
the future, will ever assent to the erroneous doctrine of temporal
decrees. God is not ignorant of future events which will be
executed by human volitions; He has foretold them in innumerable
instances, and prophecy is but the manifestation of His eternal
prescience. Scripture affirms that believers were chosen in Christ
before the world began (Eph. 1:4), yea, that grace was "given" to
them then (2 Tim. 1:9).

## They are wise

Wisdom is shown in the selection of the best possible ends and of
the fittest means of accomplishing them. That this character
belongs to the decrees of God is evident from what we know of them.
They are disclosed to us by their execution, and every proof of
wisdom in the works of God is a proof of the wisdom of the plan, in
conformity to which they are performed. As the Psalmist declared,
"O Lord, how manifold are Thy works! in wisdom hast Thou made them
all" (Ps. 104:24). It is indeed but a very small part of them which
falls under our observation, yet, we ought to proceed here as we do
in other cases, and judge of the whole by the specimen, of what is
unknown, by what is known. He who perceives the workings of
admirable skill in the parts of a machine which he has an
opportunity to examine, is naturally led to believe that the other
parts are equally admirable. In like manner should we satisfy our
minds as to God’s works when doubts obtrude themselves upon us, and
repel the objections which may be suggested by something which we
cannot reconcile to our notions of what is good and wise. When we
reach the bounds of the finite and gaze toward the mysterious realm
of the infinite, let us exclaim. "O the depth of the riches! both
of the wisdom and knowledge of God" (Rom. 11:33).

## They are Free

"Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being His counselor
hath taught Him? With whom took He counsel, and who instructed Him,
and taught Him in the path of judgment, and taught Him knowledge,
and showed to Him the way of understanding?" (Isa. 40:13,14). God
was alone when He made His decrees, and His determinations were
influenced by no external cause. He was free to decree or not to
decree, and to decree one thing and not another. This liberty we
must ascribe to Him who is supreme, independent, and sovereign in
all His doings.

## They are Sovereign

Isa. 40:13, 14; Dan. 4:35; Matt. 11:25, 26; Rom. 9:11, 15-18; Eph.
1:5, 11.

## They are absolute and unconditional

The execution of them is not suspended upon any condition which
may, or may not be, performed. In every instance where God has
decreed an end, He has also decreed every means to that end. The
One who decreed the salvation of His elect also decreed to work
faith in them (2 Thess. 2:13). "My counsel shall stand, and I will
do all My pleasure" (Isa. 46:10): but that could not be, if His
counsel depended upon a condition which might not be performed. But
God "worketh all things after the counsel of His own will" (Eph.
1:11).

Ps. 33:11; Prov. 19:21; Isa. 14:24, 27 ; 46:10; Rom. 9:11; Isa.
46:9.

## They include the means

Eph. 1:4; 2 Thess. 2:13; 1 Pet. 1:2.

## They preserve human responsibility

Scripture plainly teaches that man is a responsible creature and
answerable for his actions. And if our thoughts are formed from
God’s Word the maintenance of the one will not lead to the denial
of the other. That there is a real difficulty in defining where the
one ends and the other begins, is freely granted. This is ever the
case where there is a conjunction of the Divine and the human. Real
prayer is indited by the Spirit, yet it is also the cry of a human
heart. The Scriptures are the inspired Word of God, yet were they
written by men who were something more than machines in the hand of
the Spirit. Christ is both God and man. He is Omniscient, yet
"increased in wisdom" (Luke 2:52). He was Almighty, yet was
"crucified through weakness" (2 Cor. 13:4). He was the Prince of
life, yet He died. High mysteries are these, yet faith receives
them unquestioningly.

Gen. 50:20; Acts 2:23; 3:18; 4:27, 28.

## They determine the free actions of men

Acts 4:27, 28 ; Eph. 2:10.

## They secure conversion and the conditions for final salvation

Eph. 2:8 ; Phil. 2:13; 2 Tim. 2:25.

## They render events certain

Matt. 16:21; Luke 18:31-33; 24:46; Acts 2:23; 13:29; 1 Cor. 11:19.

## Objections to the Doctrine of the Decrees

### They are really objections to God's Foreknowledge

Whether God has decreed all things that ever come to pass or not,
all that own the being of a God, own that He knows all things
beforehand. Now, it is self-evident that if He knows all things
beforehand, He either doth approve of them or doth not approve of
them; that is, He either is willing they should be, or He is not
willing they should be. But to will that they should be is to
decree them.

Finally, attempt to assume and then contemplate the opposite. To
deny the Divine decrees would be to predicate a world and all its
concerns regulated by undesigned chance or blind fate. Then what
peace, what assurance, what comfort would there be for our poor
hearts and minds? What refuge would there be to fly to in the hour
of need and trial? None at all. There would be nothing better than
the black darkness and abject horror of atheism. O my reader, how
thankful should we be that everything is determined by infinite
wisdom and goodness! What praise and gratitude are due unto God for
His Divine decrees. It is because of them that "we know that for
those who love God all things work together for good, for those who
are called according to his purpose" (Rom. 8:28). Well may we
exclaim, "For from him and through him and to him are all things.
To him be glory forever. Amen" (Rom 11:36).

### "It is inconsistent with the moral freedom of man" - *Louis Berkhof*

Some have raised this as an objection to the doctrine of the
decrees of God. This is what
[Louis Berkhof](Louis_Berkhof "Louis Berkhof") has to say in
response:

width="20" valign="top"
style="color:\#B2B7F2;font-size:{{\#switch:20px

Man is a free agent with the power of rational self-determination.
He can reflect upon, and in an intelligent way choose, certain
ends, and can also determine his action with respect to them. The
decree of God however, carries with it necessity. God has decreed
to effectuate all things or, if He has not decreed that, He has at
least determined that they must come to pass. He has decided the
course of man's life for him. In answer to this objection it may be
said that the Bible certainly does not proceed on the assumption
that the divine decree is inconsistent with the free agency of man.
It clearly reveals that God has decreed the free acts of man, but
also that the actors are none the less free and therefore
responsible for their acts, Gen. 50:19,20; Acts 2:23; 4:27,28. It
was determined that Jews should bring about the crucifixion of
Jesus; yet they were perfectly free in their wicked course of
action, and were held responsible for this crime. There is not a
single indication is Scripture that the inspired writers are
conscious of a contradiction in connection with these matters. They
never make an attempt to harmonize the two. This may well restrain
us from assuming a contradiction here, even if we cannot reconcile
both truths.

### "It takes away all motives for human exertion" - *Louis Berkhof*

Some have raised this as an objection to the doctrine of the
decrees of God. This is what
[Louis Berkhof](Louis_Berkhof "Louis Berkhof") has to say in
response:

width="20" valign="top"

This objection is to the effect that people will naturally say
that, if all things are bound to happen as God has determined them,
they need not concern themselves about the future and need not make
any efforts to attain salvation. But this is hardly correct. In the
case of people who speak after that fashion this is generally the
mere excuse of indolence and disobedience. The divine decrees are
not addressed to men as a rule of action, and cannot be such a
rule, since their contents become known only through, and therefore
after, their realization. There is a rule of action, however,
embodied in the law and in the gospel, and this puts men under
obligation to employ the means which God has ordained.

### "It makes God the author of sin" - *Louis Berkhof*

Some have raised this as an objection to the doctrine of the
decrees of God. This is what
[Louis Berkhof](Louis_Berkhof "Louis Berkhof") has to say in
response:

width="20" valign="top"
style="color:\#B2B7F2;font-size:{{\#switch:20px
10px=20px
30px=60px
40px=80px
50px=100px
60px=120px
“
This, if true, would naturally be an insuperable objection, for God
cannot be the author of sin. This follows equally from Scripture,
Ps. 92:15; Eccl. 7:29; Jas. 1:13; 1 John 1:5, from the law of God
which prohibits all sin, and from the holiness of God. But the
charge is not true; the decree merely makes God the author of free
moral beings, who are themselves the authors of sin. God decrees to
sustain their free agency, to regulate the circumstances of their
life, and to permit that free agency to exert itself in a multitude
of acts, of which some are sinful. For good and holy reasons He
renders these sinful acts certain, but He does not decree to work
evil desires or choices efficiently in man. The decree respecting
sin is not an efficient but a permissive decree, or a decree to
permit, in distinction from a decree to produce, sin by divine
efficiency. No difficulty attaches to such a decree which does not
also attach to a *mere* passive permission of what He could very
well prevent, such as the Arminians, who generally raise this
objection, assume. The problem of God's relation to sin remains a
mystery for us, which we are not able to solve. It may be said,
however, that His decree to permit sin, while it renders the
entrance of sin into the world certain, does not mean He takes
delight in it; but only that He deemed it wise, for the purpose of
His self-revelation, to permit moral evil, however abhorrent it may
be to His nature.
