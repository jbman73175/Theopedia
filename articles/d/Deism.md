**Deism** is the belief that God has created the universe but
remains apart from it and permits his creation to administer itself
through natural laws. Deism thus rejects the supernatural aspects
of religion, such as belief in revelation in the Bible, and
stresses the importance of ethical conduct. In the eighteenth
century, numerous important thinkers held deist
beliefs.^[[1]](#note-0)^

Deism became prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries during the
[Age of Enlightenment](Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment"),
especially in the United Kingdom. Deism spread to France, notably
via the work of Voltaire, to Germany, and to America.

## Deism versus Theism

Prior to the 17th century the terms ["Deism" and "Deist"] were used
interchangeably with the terms "theism" and "theist", respectively.
. . Theologians and philosophers of the seventeenth century began
to give a different signification to the words.... Both [theists
and Deists] asserted belief in one supreme God, the Creator.... and
agreed that God is personal and distinct from the world. But the
theist taught that God remained actively interested in and
operative in the world which he had made, whereas the Deist
maintained that God endowed the world at creation with
self-sustaining and self-acting powers and then abandoned it to the
operation of these powers acting as second causes.^[[2]](#note-1)^

The theory of
[Pandeism](index.php?title=Pandeism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pandeism (page does not exist)")
was later developed in an effort to reconcile the conceits of
[Pantheism](Pantheism "Pantheism") with Deism.^[[3]](#note-2)^
