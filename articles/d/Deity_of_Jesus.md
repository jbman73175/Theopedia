The **deity of Jesus** is considered an
[essential doctrine](Essential_doctrines "Essential doctrines") and
is a central non-negotiable belief within Christianity. Also known
as the "divinity of Christ," this [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine")
asserts that [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") was and is
[God incarnate](Incarnation_of_Christ "Incarnation of Christ"). As
the apostle [Paul](Paul "Paul") stated, "the whole fullness of
deity dwells bodily" (Col. 2:9; ESV).

> Now the Christian meaning of the term "deity of Christ" is fairly
> clear. The Christian believes that there is a personal God, Creator
> and Ruler of the universe, a God who is infinite, eternal and
> unchangeable. So when the Christian says that Jesus Christ is God,
> or when he says that he believes in the "deity of Christ," he means
> that that same person who is known to history as Jesus of Nazareth
> existed, before He became man, from all eternity as infinite,
> eternal and unchangeable God, the second person of the holy
> Trinity.
