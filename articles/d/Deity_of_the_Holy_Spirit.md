"The [Bible](Bible "Bible") clearly represents the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") as possessing divine
attributes and exercising divine authority. Since the fourth
century, nearly all who agree that the Spirit is a person also
agree that He is divine."^[[1]](#note-0)^ When viewed together,
passages from the [Old](Old_Testament "Old Testament") and
[New Testaments](New_Testament "New Testament") depict the Holy
Spirit as a divine person equal to the
[Father](God_the_Father "God the Father") and the
[Son](Jesus "Jesus"). Thus, the Holy Spirit is said to be one of
the three personalities of the triune God, also referred to as the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity").

In Chapter 5 of the [Book of Acts](Book_of_Acts "Book of Acts"),
[Luke](Luke "Luke") shows clearly the divine
[nature](Nature "Nature") of the Holy Spirit when he writes of a
couple who sold their property and gave the proceeds to the church.
Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, voluntarily sold the land and
presented the money to the apostles. Ananias, with Sapphira's
knowledge, kept back a portion of the money he received from the
sale. The text suggests Ananias presented the portion as the whole.
In v. 3 Peter says, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled
your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for
yourself some of the money you received for the land?" In v. 4,
Peter rebukes Ananias saying, "You have not lied to men but to
God." In these two verses, Luke equates lying to the Spirit with
lying to God, demonstrating the divine nature of the Holy Spirit.

In [Matthew](Matthew "Matthew")'s Gospel, the
[apostle](Apostle "Apostle") introduces the trinitarian nature of
the Holy Spirit when he writes of Jesus'
[Great Commission](Great_Commission "Great Commission") in Matt.
28:18-20. Jesus tells His followers to go into all the world to
make [disciples](Disciple "Disciple") by
[baptizing](Baptism "Baptism") them and teaching them to obey all
of His commands. When these disciples are baptized, they are to be
baptized "in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit" (v. 19), Jesus says.

The deity of the Holy Spirit can also be inferred from the act of
[creation](Creation "Creation"). Genesis 1:1 says God created the
heavens and the earth. The very next verse suggests the Holy Spirit
(identified in Gen. 1:2 as the Spirit of God) hovered above a
formless and empty earth and participated in the creation. The
apostle [John](John "John") says in John 1:3 nothing was made
without Jesus. In these verses, the Bible depicts God, Jesus and
the Spirit as having the same powers to
[create something out of nothing](Creation_ex_nihilo "Creation ex nihilo").

Words used to describe the divine attributes of God, like eternal,
omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent, can be applied to the Holy
Spirit, too. The writer of Hebrews spoke of the eternal Spirit
(Heb. 9:14); [Paul](Paul "Paul") wrote the Spirit searches the deep
things of God and no one knows the thoughts of God except the
Spirit (1 Cor. 2:10-11); King [David](David "David") wrote in
Psalms 139:7-10 that no matter where he fled, he could not flee
from God's Spirit and presence; and the Gen. 1:2 verse affirms the
omnipotent nature of the Holy Spirit.
