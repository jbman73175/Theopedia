A **denomination** is an identifiable religious body under a common
name, structure, and/or [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine").
Expressions of [Christianity](Christianity "Christianity"), in
modern times, exist under diverse names. The greatest divisions in
Christianity today however are between
[Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy"),
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism"), and the
various forms of [Protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism")
which came out of the
[Protestant Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation").

The different forms of Protestantism developed historically along
geographical and political lines, as well as by doctrinal
differences, exhibiting various degrees of commonality. Groups such
as [Lutherans](Lutheran "Lutheran"),
[Anglicans](Anglican "Anglican"),
[Presbyterians](Presbyterian "Presbyterian"),
[Methodists](Methodist "Methodist"), etc. find their roots in the
Reformation and are are commonly referred to as Christian
denominations with differences in
[ecclesiology](Ecclesiology "Ecclesiology") and
[theology](Theology "Theology"). In some groups, congregations are
part of a particular church denominational hierarchy, while in
other denominations, notably [Baptists](Baptists "Baptists") and
Congregationalists, each congregation is an independent autonomous
local body. Local-congregation-autonomy within Protestant
Christianity has grown due to the 20th century independent Bible
Church movement, especially in the U.S. Technically, Bible Churches
do not comprise a Protestant denomination, although they have
become a significant identifiable segment.

Denominationalism may also be viewed ideologically, regarding some
or all Christian groups as being, to some extent, versions of the
same thing -- regardless of their distinguishing labels. Not all
denominations would agree with this, however; and there are some
groups which practically all others would view as
[apostate](Apostate "Apostate") or [heretical](Heresy "Heresy") --
that is, not legitimate versions of Christianity.
