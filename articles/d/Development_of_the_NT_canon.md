The **Development of the New Testament canon** is the process by
which the books now composing the New Testament were identified by
the Church to the exclusion of other Christian and pseudo-Christian
writings in use by some in those early times. It is important to
note that the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament")
documents were not accepted as [Scripture](Scripture "Scripture")
because they were in a collection, rather the Church regarded these
separate documents as Scripture, and accordingly gathered them
together into the accepted canon.

## Historical overview

For the first hundred years or so of the Christian faith, documents
like the letters written by Paul, and the four histories of Jesus,
which we call “the Gospels”, had been circulated and copied
throughout the churches for use in teaching. Very quickly, these
documents came to be regarded as holy Scripture, of equal
importance (or more, in the eyes of some) as the Jewish scriptures,
which are referred to today as the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament").

Around 140 A.D. (110 years after Jesus' death), a man called
[Marcion](Marcion "Marcion") began teaching a version of
Christianity which viewed the God of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") as a wrathful God
incompatible with the *loving* God of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"). He therefore
rejected the theology of the Old Testament. To support his
teachings, Marcion published a canon – a list of documents which he
considered to be holy Scripture – which included only an edited
version of the [Gospel of Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke"),
and 10 of Paul's letters. This situation highlighted the need for
consistent understanding in the Church of what documents (or books)
were indeed canonical (i.e. accepted as authoritative), and could
be used for setting and defending church doctrine. It is important
to note that Marcion did not actually start the process of forming
the canon, rather the controversy he started accelerated and
solidified an existing process.

At the time of Marcion, two different sets of documents had already
been assembled and circulated. The first was the four accounts of
the story of Jesus – according to
[Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew"),
[Mark](Gospel_of_Mark "Gospel of Mark"),
[Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke") and
[John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") – which were bound together
and called The Gospel. The second, usually called the Pauline
corpus, was the collection of the letters by the apostle
[Paul](Paul "Paul"). Both of these documents appear to have been
quoted as Scripture by [Ignatius](Ignatius "Ignatius"), bishop of
Antioch, around 115 A.D., so probably had been in circulation for
quite some years before that date. There was also a collection of
the [general letters](General_epistles "General epistles") – those
of [Peter](Peter "Peter"), [John](John "John"),
[James](James "James") and
[Jude](Epistle_of_Jude "Epistle of Jude") – with which the
[Acts of the Apostles](Acts_of_the_Apostles "Acts of the Apostles"),
now separated from the Gospel of Luke with which it was originally
written, was eventually included.

By 200 A.D., the majority of the New Testament was established. A
document called the “Muratorian Fragment” refers to Luke as the
third Gospel (assumedly listing Matthew and Mark before it), then
lists John, Paul's 13 letters,
[Jude](Epistle_of_Jude "Epistle of Jude"), two epistles of John and
the [Book of Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation")
as Scripture. In the early 300's, [Origen](Origen "Origen") lists
the four Gospels, Paul's 13 letters, one letter each of Peter and
John, and the Revelation. He also notes that
[Hebrews](Epistle_to_the_Hebrews "Epistle to the Hebrews"),
[2 Peter](Second_Epistle_of_Peter "Second Epistle of Peter"),
[2](Second_Epistle_of_John "Second Epistle of John") and
[3 John](Third_Epistle_of_John "Third Epistle of John"),
[James](Epistle_of_James "Epistle of James") and Jude, amongst
other documents were debated by some. At the same time,
[Eusebius](Eusebius "Eusebius") lists all of the New Testament
documents except James, Jude, Peter's second letter and John's
second and third letters, which he says are disputed by some, but
recognised by the majority.

In 367, [Athanasius](Athanasius "Athanasius") lists the 27
documents of the New Testament alone, and he is quickly followed by
[Jerome](Jerome "Jerome") and [Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") in
the church in Europe. At the councils of Hippo Regius in 393, and
Carthage in 397, the church in the west as a body approved the 27
documents alone as Scripture. According to Bruce, "the process
farther east took a little longer; it was not until c. 508 that 2
Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude and Revelation were included in a version
of the Syriac Bible in addition to the other twenty two books."
