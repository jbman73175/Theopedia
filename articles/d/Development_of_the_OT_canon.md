[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament")
What is now known by Christians as the

still known by the Jews as the [Tanakh](Hebrew#Tanakh "Hebrew")
which is an acronym based on the three distinct parts of the Hebrew
Scriptures: the Torah (*Law*), the Nevi’im (*Prophets*), and the
Kethuvim (*Writings*).

## Historical Overview

From the time of the [Exodus](Exodus "Exodus") to the end of the
Divided Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, constant records were kept of
the history of the Israelites. It is believed that the bulk of the
Torah,
[the first five books of the Tanakh](Pentateuch "Pentateuch"), was
written by Moses while the Children of Israel camped at Mt. Sinai.

In the case of the other historical books, such as
[Joshua](Book_of_Joshua "Book of Joshua"),
[Judges](Book_of_Judges "Book of Judges"),
[1](Books_of_Samuel "Books of Samuel") &
[2 Samuel](Books_of_Samuel "Books of Samuel"),
[1](Books_of_Kings "Books of Kings") &
[2 Kings](Books_of_Kings "Books of Kings"),
[1](Books_of_Chronicles "Books of Chronicles") &
[2 Chronicles](Books_of_Chronicles "Books of Chronicles"),
[Ezra](Book_of_Ezra "Book of Ezra"), and
[Nehemiah](Book_of_Nehemiah "Book of Nehemiah"), it is believed
that the priest-scribe [Ezra](Ezra "Ezra") compiled them from
original records made nearer the time of their occurrence (works
such as *The Book of Jashar* and *The Book of the Wars of Yahweh*).
^[1](#Footnotes)^

These are, as of yet, lost to us but it may be that these will one
day be found again. Ezra’s compilation would have taken place in
the 5th century B.C. As for the books of prophecy and other
writings, both poetic and moral, there is little attestation as to
when they were finally organized into a coherent unit but the
Tanakh as we know it today was closed around the year 200 B.C.
^[2](#Footnotes)^

Over the next few centuries, the text would be standardized and
given proper vocalization and punctuation, allowing for better
translation. This work was carried out entirely by the *Sopherim*
(“scribes”) and the *Masoretes* (“keepers of tradition”).

## Canonical History

The Hebrew Tanakh required very little official action to indicate
that it should be accepted as the authoritative and inspired Word
of God. In the case of the Torah - the Law - everything that Moses
wrote down and gave to the Israelites was immediately accepted on
the basis that he was a prophet and had received
[special revelation](Special_revelation "Special revelation") from
God concerning four of the five books of the Torah.

In much the same way, the Nevi’im - the Prophets - were accepted as
the direct revelation of God to his chosen people. This not only
included the works of the major and minor prophets, but also the
books of Joshua, Judges, 1 & 2 Samuel, and 1 & 2 Kings (which, in
the Tanakh, are Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings). Because
prophets wrote them, they were received immediately as if they had
been written at the very throne of God.

The early Hebrew Scriptures were viewed as holy even during the
periods of widespread apostasy in Israel. During the reign of King
Josiah of Judah, the Temple of Solomon was being restored and,
among the ruins, there was found a scroll - the book of the Law,
since identified as the Book of Deuteronomy. When King Josiah heard
the words written within this book, he was grieved seeing how far
the Kingdom of Judah had gone from the Law of the LORD. In order to
make certain that this was, indeed, the Word of God, however,
Josiah sent the scroll with some of his chief men to the house of
the prophetess Huldah. Concerning it, she said that it was the holy
Word of God - being the first person in recorded history to state
that the Torah was “set apart” from other writings. (Cf. 2 Kings
22:10-20 and 2 Chronicles 34:15-28)

So the Torah and the Nevi’im - “the Law and the Prophets” that form
such a familiar phrase to Christians and Jews - were accepted as
canon centuries before Christ.

The Psalms, the Proverbs, and even the Book of Daniel were not
considered canon from the day they were given. Just when did they
become canon? At this point, it is important to make a distinction
between canonical treatment and canonical acceptance. Before the
first century A.D., The Psalms were well established in the Hebrew
community - being used by all the people for the worship of God.
The teachers of the people used them to encourage them and often
spoke concerning them. Much the same was done with the books of
Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the book of Daniel. Even the Song
of Songs had a place in Hebrew worship - being read often at
weddings, as with the book of Ruth.

1 & 2 Chronicles - a repetition of sorts of the books of 1 & 2
Kings, although focusing further on the kingdom of Israel - were
used by the scribes and scholars for reference and as a general
history of the monarchy - continued with the accounts in the books
of Ezra and Nehemiah (which, in the Tanakh, are kept as one book).
The book of Esther was read yearly with the celebration of Purim
while Lamentations was read on the Ninth of Av - a day of mourning
for all the Hebrews remembering the sack of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar.

Thus, the books were treated as canon for many years. In 90 A.D.,
however, the Council of Jamnia formally adopted them as canonical
Hebrew Scripture and declaring that the Tanakh was complete - being
the entirety of the revelation of God to His people concerning His
promise.

## Place in the Church

Today, Protestant and Evangelical Christians retain the canon that
was formally accepted in 90 A.D. by the Council of Jamnia. The
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
and the
[Eastern Orthodox Church](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church"),
along with other liturgical churches in the Near East, refuse to
accept the council’s ruling of authoritative because they believe
that the Hebrews lost the authority to determine what was canon at
that time. They ignore, however, the fact that, besides the Council
of Trullo, early Church Fathers like
[Athanasius](Athanasius "Athanasius") (the historical defender of
the doctrine of the Trinity) and Cyril of Jerusalem - both
respected elders in the Church - accepted the Hebrew canon.

Still, refusing to accept this, the Roman Catholic Church did not
formalize their canon until the Council of Trent that convened in
1545 and adjourned in 1563. This collection was quite different
from the Tanakh - holding historical books and literary fiction
that was never accepted as holy by the Hebrews - despite the fact
these books were long available before Jamnia. They are the
following:

-   Tobit
-   Judith
-   Additions to Esther
-   1 & 2 Maccabees
-   The Wisdom of Solomon
-   Sirach (also known as Ecclesiasticus)
-   Baruch (including the Letter of Jeremiah)
-   Additions to Daniel (including the Prayer of Azariah, Bel and
    the Dragon, Susannah, and the Song of Three Holy Children)

Of these, only 1 & 2 Maccabees are verifiably historical - and,
ironically, they are also the only ones that originated in the land
of Israel. All of the others were written originally in Greek and
were popular among the Jews of Alexandria - who placed them in the
Greek translation of the Tanakh - the Septuagint - which was
written on the order of Ptolemy Philadelphus for his library.

The Orthodox traditions are divided on the issue - many citing the
Council of Trullo as an authority and claiming the Hebrew canon.
However, early church tradition in that denomination also
recommends the Septuagint for personal edification - although
Slavonic and Russian Orthodox churches have adopted it as
authoritative. As of the present, the Orthodox tradition has never
truly defined its standards universally.
