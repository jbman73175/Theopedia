The **development of the canon** deals with how the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") came to be. "The word 'canon' derives from
the Hebrew term *qaneh* and the Greek term *kanon*, both of which
refer to a measuring rod. It designates the exclusive collection of
documents in the Judeo-Christian tradition that have come to be
recognized as Scripture. The Jewish canon was written in both
Hebrew and Aramaic, while the Christian canon was written in
Greek."

## Development of the NT canon

The New Testament documents were not accepted as Scripture because
they were in a collection, rather the Church regarded these
separate documents as Scripture and accordingly gathered them
together. For the first hundred years or so of the Christian faith,
documents such as the letters written by Paul and the four
histories of Jesus ([the Gospels](Four_Gospels "Four Gospels")) had
been circulated and copied throughout the churches for use in
teaching. These documents soon came to be recognized as Holy
Scripture, of equal importance (or more, in the eyes of some) as
the Jewish Scriptures, which we refer to today as the Old
Testament.
