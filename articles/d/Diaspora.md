**Diaspora** (from the Greek meaning *to scatter* or *disperse*)
refers to Jews forced to live outside, or dispersed from
[Judea](index.php?title=Judea&action=edit&redlink=1 "Judea (page does not exist)").
Biblically this may refer to Jews scattered at the hands of the
Assyrians circa 722 B.C. and/or the Babylonian exile circa 586 B.C.
Subsequently, it may refer to Jews dispersed following the
destruction of Jerusalem at the hands of the Roman Empire in 70
A.D.
