The **Didache** (Koine [Greek](Greek "Greek"): *teaching*), short
for
"*Teaching of the Lord to the Gentiles by the Twelve Apostles*," is
a short early Christian treatise containing instructions for
Christian communities. The text, believed by many to have been
written prior to A.D. 150,^[[1]](#note-0)^ can be seen as a
handbook for pagan converts, with three main sections dealing with
Christian lessons, rituals such as [baptism](Baptism "Baptism") and
[eucharist](Communion "Communion"), and Church organization.

References to a writing known as the "Teaching" or "Teachings of
the Apostles" are found in [Eusebius](Eusebius "Eusebius") about
325,
[Athanasius of Alexandria](Athanasius_of_Alexandria "Athanasius of Alexandria")
in a letter of 367, and in lists of texts from the beginning of the
fourth century. But inasmuch as nothing is specifically cited, it
is not certain if the references are to the document we know today
as the *Didache*, although this is assumed by many.

As such, it was considered by some of the
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers")
as part of the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") canon
but rejected as spurious by others. It was finally excluded from
the accepted canon by all except the Ethiopian Orthodox church. The
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
has accepted it as part of the collection of
[Apostolic Fathers](Apostolic_Fathers "Apostolic Fathers").

Considered lost, the Didache was rediscovered in 1883 by Philotheos
Bryennios, a [Greek Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox")
metropolitan bishop of Nicomedia, in the Greek
*Codex Hierosolymitanus* written in 1053, from which he had already
published the full text of the *Epistles of Clement* in 1875.
