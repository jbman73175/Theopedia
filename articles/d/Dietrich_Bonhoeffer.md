Dietrich Bonhoeffer
**Dietrich Bonhoeffer** (1906 – 1945) was a German
[Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran") theologian and pastor. He was also
a participant in the resistance movement against Nazism. Bonhoeffer
was involved in various schemes formulated by members of the German
Military Intelligence Office to assassinate Adolf Hitler and in
April 1943 was arrested, imprisoned and ultimately hanged in
[Flossenbuerg](http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/othercamps/flossenburg.html)
just before the end of the Second World War in Europe.

## Bonhoeffer's legacy

Dietrich Bonhoeffer is considered a martyr for his faith. In the
mid-1990s, the German Government officially absolved him of any
"crimes" he might have committed pursuant to the positive law of
the National Socialist
regime.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
The calendars of the
[Episcopal Church](Episcopal_Church "Episcopal Church") and the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorate him on April 9,
the date on which he was hanged in 1945. His books *Ethics* (1949)
and *Letters and Papers from Prison* (1953) were published shortly
after his death. The theological and political reasons behind his
shift from Christian pacifism, which he espoused in the mid-1930s,
to participation in planning the assassination of Hitler are much
debated. Bonhoeffer's last writings, as found in his fragmentary
*Letters and Papers from Prison*, continue to intrigue theologians,
and there has been a considerable amount of scholarly discussion
about his
[theological development](http://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0AeRAvQIYFleRZGdkaGpjZ18xMDZodHdkYjljdw&hl=en_GB).
In his well-known letters Bonhoeffer introduced the concepts of
"religionless Christianity" and "a world come of age", which in
turn became incorporated into both John A. T. Robinson’s
controversial 1963 book *Honest to God* and the "Death of God"
movement. Bonhoeffer is one of the few theologians embraced by both
liberal and conservative Christians, but each group interprets his
prison theology
differently.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
Conservatives see those writings as simply another expression of
his earlier traditional theology, although in an updated language.
Liberals interpret his prison writings as a radical new expression
of a much more secular understanding of the basic Christian
message.
^[***[citations\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
Before his death Bonhoeffer himself frequently commented on the
radical nature of his late thought. His last words were: "This is
the end - for me the beginning of life."

Bonhoeffer is one of the ten twentieth-century martyrs from across
the world who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of
Westminster Abbey, London.

## Quotes

-   "Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring
    repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without
    confession, absolution without personal confession. Cheap grace is
    grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without
    Jesus Christ, living and incarnate." - *Costly Grace*
-   " Such grace is costly because it call us to follow, and it is
    grace because it calls us to follow Jesus Christ It is costly
    because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a
    man the only true life. It is costly because it condemns sin, and
    grace because it justifies the sinner. Above all, it is costly
    because it cost the life of his Son: "ye were brought with a
    price," and what has cost God much cannot be cheap for us. Above
    all it is grace because God did not reckon his Son too dear a price
    to pay for our life, but delivered him up for us. Costly grace is
    the Incarnation of God."- *Costly Grace*
-   Concerning Christ's command to cut off the hand and gouge out
    the eye that causes one to sin, "Surely, at this point we must make
    up our minds once and for all whether Jesus means his precepts to
    be taken literally or only figuratively, for here it is a matter of
    life or death... Jesus does not impose intolerable restriction on
    his disciples, he does not forbid them to look at anything, but
    bids them look on him." -*Cost of Discipleship*
-   "When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die." -
    *Cost of Discipleship*
