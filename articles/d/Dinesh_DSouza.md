**Dinesh D'Souza**, born in 1961 in India, is a Christian
apologist, author, policy analyst, and the former Robert and Karen
Rishwain Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.
D'Souza is known amongst Christians for his prolific debates with
several prominent figures of the
[New Atheism](New_Atheism "New Atheism"). These include debates
with Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, Michael Shermer, and Dan
Barker. D'Souza has written numerous books, including his
*What's So Great About Christianity*. D'Souza graduated Phi Beta
Kappa from Dartmouth College in 1983 and is a
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic").

Regarding his book, *What's So Great About Christianity*,
[Albert Mohler](Albert_Mohler "Albert Mohler") had this to say:

"Christians will find Dinesh D'Souza's latest book to be both
interesting and helpful. His apologetic model is
[G. K. Chesterton](G._K._Chesterton "G. K. Chesterton"), and he
writes with a similar style and verve. I found his argument that
Christians should embrace [evolution](Evolution "Evolution") while
rejecting Darwinism to be unconvincing and unhelpful. The dominant
model of evolutionary theory is just as atheistic and incompatible
with Christianity as classical Darwinism."
