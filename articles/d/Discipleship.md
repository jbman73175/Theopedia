### "Be transformed"

"Discipleship" is a term used to refer to a disciple's
transformation from some other worldview and practice of life into
that of Jesus Christ, and so, by way of
[Trinitarian](Trinity "Trinity") theology, of God himself. Note the
[Apostle Paul](Apostle_Paul "Apostle Paul")'s description of this
process, that the disciple
*"not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may discern what is the will of Godâ€”what is good and acceptable and perfect."*
Therefore a disciple is not simply an accumulator of information or
one who merely changes moral behavior in regards to the teachings
of Jesus Christ, but in response to God's work in him or her seeks
a fundamental shift toward the ethics of Jesus Christ in every
way.

Lee C. Camp, in *Mere Discipleship* writes

In the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") this
transformation is analogized in many ways as an activity (often
with athletic language) which points to the future promised by God
through Jesus and his Apostles and Prophets.

-   Philippians 3:13 "but I press on to make it my own ...
    forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies
    ahead"
-   1 Corinthians 9:24,25 "Run in such a way that you may win it.
    Athletes exercise self-control in all things; they do it to receive
    a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable one."
-   1 Timothy 6 18:19 "They are to do good, to be rich in good
    works, generous, and ready to share, thus storing up for themselves
    the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may
    take hold of the life that really is life."
-   Hebrew 13:12-14 "Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the city
    gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood. Let us then
    go to him outside the camp and bear the abuse he endured. For here
    we have no lasting city, but we are looking for the city that is to
    come.

### "Love one another"

Jesus offers a self-referential, and what is perhaps the most
definitive, example of discipleship in the
[Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") 13:34-35: "I give
you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have
loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will
know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."
([NRSV](NRSV "NRSV")) Further definition by Jesus can be found in
[Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke") 14, which is a veritable
treatise on the topic. Beginning with a testing trap laid out by
his adversaries regarding observance of the Jewish
[Sabbath](Sabbath "Sabbath"), Jesus uses the opportunity to lay out
the problems with the religiosity of his adversaries against his
own teaching by providing a litany of shocking comparisons between
various socio-political and socio-economic realities versus the
meaning of being his disciple. Examples which are expressed
definitions of a disciple are:

-   Luke 14:26 Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and
    mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life
    itself, cannot be my disciple.
-   Luke 14:27 Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me
    cannot be my disciple.
-   Luke 14:33 So therefore, none of you can become my disciple if
    you do not give up all your possessions.

### Discipleship for the [Twelve](Twelve_disciples "Twelve disciples")

The same process of transformation is also evident in the recorded
experiences of the original twelve disciples of Jesus. Though
regarded highly throughout
[Church history](Church_history "Church history"), the biblical
texts themselves do not attempt to show the Twelve as faultless or
even having a solid grasp of Jesus' own ministry, including a
recognition of their part in it. All four gospel texts are not
reluctant to convey the confusion and foibles of the Twelve in
their attempt to internalize and live out the ministry of Jesus
within their own discipleship.

Perhaps the greatest disappointment for Jesus, in regards to the
Twelve, is when he announces that he will be put to death. Peter at
that point boldly rebukes Jesus saying, "God forbid it, Lord! This
must never happen to you." To which Jesus responds, "Get behind me,
Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are setting your
mind not on divine things but on human things. [...] If any want to
become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their
cross and follow me" (Matthew 15). While Jesus is teaching that
humility and self-sacrifice are the ways of discipleship Peter is
still demanding self-preservation. This contradicts Jesus'
teaching, even if it is for the sake of his master.

Some other examples where the Twelve worked directly against the
very heart of the ministry of Jesus: In Matthew 19 Jesus rebuked
the Twelve for their disinterest in children and Jesus explains
that children are a model for a heavenly demeanor. In Luke 14,
Philip demands that Jesus show them the Father, to which Jesus
exasperatedly explains that they should know by then that if they
have seen him, they have, in fact, seen the Father. In Matthew 10
the disciples argue over which of themselves will be the greatest
when Jesus' kingdom comes into full effect. Jesus responds, to
explain their gross misunderstanding of the humble and
self-sacrificial nature of his teaching, "whoever wishes to be
great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be
first among you must be your slave.".

### The Great Commission

Ubiquitous throughout Christianity is the practice of
[proselytizing](index.php?title=Proselytizing&action=edit&redlink=1 "Proselytizing (page does not exist)"),
making new disciples. At the beginning of Jesus' ministry, when
calling his earliest disciples Simon (Peter) and Andrew , he says
to them, "Follow me and I will make you fish for people" (Matthew
4:19). Then, at the very end of his ministry Jesus institutes the
[Great Commission](Great_Commission "Great Commission"), commanding
all present to "go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have
commanded you" (Matthew 28:19-20a). Jesus has incorporated this
practice into the very definition of being a disciple and
experiencing discipleship.

### Discipleship in relationship

-   catechists and catechumens in the early church
-   "discipleship" as a reference to the relationship in and
    process of "discipling"

### Pentecost and onward

According to the Book of Acts, at
[Pentecost](Pentecost "Pentecost") with the coming of the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit"), the disciples take on a
new boldness, accuracy and discipline in their discipleship. It is
from this point where we see the often confused and fearful band of
disciples (not limited in this context to the Twelve) mature into
the early Church, the pioneers of the faith of all modern
Christians worldwide.
