**Dispensationalism** is a theological system that teaches biblical
history is best understood in light of a number of successive
administrations of God's dealings with mankind, which it calls
"dispensations." It maintains fundamental distinctions between
God's plans for national Israel and for the New Testament Church,
and emphasizes prophecy of the end-times and a
pre-[tribulation](Tribulation "Tribulation")
[rapture](Rapture "Rapture") of the church prior to Christ's
[Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming"). Its beginnings are
usually associated with the
[Plymouth Brethren](Plymouth_Brethren "Plymouth Brethren") movement
in the UK and the teachings of
[John Nelson Darby](John_Nelson_Darby "John Nelson Darby").

## History

The [Plymouth Brethren](Plymouth_Brethren "Plymouth Brethren")
movement, basically a reaction against the established church in
England and its [ecclesiology](Ecclesiology "Ecclesiology"), became
known for its anti-denominational, anti-clerical, and anti-credal
stance. While theologically orthodox, the Plymouth Brethren (Darby
in particular) developed unique ideas regarding the interpretation
of Scripture while emphasizing prophecy and the
[second coming](Second_coming "Second coming") of Christ. The
theology of this movement became known as "Dispensationalism."

This new teaching spread in America through prophecy conferences
such as the Niagara Bible Conferences (1883-1897).
[James H. Brookes](James_H._Brookes "James H. Brookes")
(1830-1898), a pastor in St. Louis and prominent figure in the
Niagara Conferences, disseminated dispensationalist ideas through
his ministry and publications. Most importantly,
[Dwight L. Moody](Dwight_L._Moody "Dwight L. Moody") was
sympathetic to the broad outlines of dispensationalism and had as
his closest lieutenants dispensationalist leaders such as Reuben A.
Torrey (1856-1928), James M. Gray (1851-1925),
[Cyrus I. Scofield](Cyrus_I._Scofield "Cyrus I. Scofield")
(1843-1921), William J. Eerdman (1833-1923), A. C. Dixon
(1854-1925), and A. J. Gordon (1836-1895). These men were activist
evangelists who promoted a host of Bible conferences and other
missionary and evangelistic efforts. They also gave the
dispensationalist movement institutional permanence by assuming
leadership of the new independent Bible institutes such as the
Moody Bible Institute (1886), the Bible Institute of Los Angeles
(1907), and the Philadelphia College of the Bible (1914). The
network of related institutes that soon sprang up became the
nucleus for the spread of American dispensationalism.

### The dispensations

1.  the dispensation of innocence (or freedom), (Gen. 2:8-17,25),
    prior to Adam's [fall](Original_sin "Original sin"),
2.  of conscience, (Gen. 3:10-18; Rom. 2:11-15), Adam to Noah,
3.  of government, (Gen. 9:6; Rom. 13:1), Noah to Abraham,
4.  of patriarchal rule (or promise), (Gen. 12:1-3; 22:17-18; Gal.
    3:15-19), Abraham to Moses,
5.  of the Mosaic Law, (Ex. 20:1-26; Gal. 3:19), Moses to Christ,
6.  of [grace](Grace "Grace"), (Rom. 5:20-21; Eph. 3:1-9), the
    current church age, and
7.  of a literal earthly 1,000 year
    [Millennial Kingdom](Millennial_Kingdom "Millennial Kingdom") that
    has yet to come but soon will, (Is. 9:6-7; 11:1-9; Rev. 20:1-6).

Each one of these dispensations is said to represent a different
way in which God deals with man, specifically a different testing
for man. "These periods are marked off in Scripture by some change
in God's method of dealing with mankind, in respect to two
questions: of sin, and of man's responsibility," explained
[C. I. Scofield](C._I._Scofield "C. I. Scofield"). "Each of the
dispensations may be regarded as a new test of the natural man, and
each ends in judgment - marking his utter failure in every
dispensation."

The idea of different "dispensations" may be found in the writings
of some of the
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers"),
and viewing the flow of biblical history as a series of
"dispensations" may be seen in some works that pre-date Darby's
dispensationalism, such as *L'OEconomie Divine* by Pierre Poiret
(1646-1719). But these earlier works did not include the unique
testing/failure motif described by Scofield or any hint of the
underlying tenets of Darby's dispensationalism.

### Beliefs about the Church and Israel

In addition to these dispensations, the real theological
significance can be seen in **four basic tenets** which underlie
classic dispensational teaching. Dispensationalism maintains:

1.  a fundamental distinction between Israel and the church, i.e.
    there are two peoples of God with two different destinies, earthly
    Israel and the spiritual church, ^[[1]](#note-0)^
2.  a fundamental distinction between the Law and Grace, i.e. they
    are mutually exclusive ideas, ^[[2]](#note-1)^
3.  the view that the New Testament church is a parenthesis in
    God's plan which was not foreseen by the Old Testament,
    ^[[3]](#note-2)^ and
4.  a distinction between the [Rapture](Rapture "Rapture") and the
    [Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming") of Christ, i.e. the
    rapture of the church at Christ's coming "in the air" (1 Thess.
    4:17) precedes the "official" second coming (to the earth) by 7
    years of tribulation.

These tenets are supposedly derived from the dispensationalists'
insistence on "consistent literalism" in their
[hermeneutic](Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics"), especially in the
literal interpretation of OT prophecies regarding
Israel.^[[4]](#note-3)^ Crucial to the dispensationalist reading of
biblical prophecy, drawn principally from Daniel and Revelation,
but also, to some degree, from Ezekiel, is the assertion that the
Jewish Temple will be rebuilt on the Temple Mount as a precursor to
the Lord returning to restore the earthly Kingdom of Israel
centered on Jerusalem. The dispensational movement was therefore
fueled by the re-establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. It
has grown in popularity particularly since 1967, coinciding with
the Arab-Israeli Six Day War, and a few years later in 1970 with
the publication of [Hal Lindsey](Hal_Lindsey "Hal Lindsey")'s
blockbuster book *The Late Great Planet Earth*.

Dispensationalism teaches that the
[Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming") of Jesus Christ will
be a physical event, by which a world-wide kingdom will be
established in human history, geographically centered in Jerusalem.
Dispensationalists teach that the Second Coming will be a two step
process. In the first step, Christ returns to
[resurrect](Resurrection "Resurrection") the blessed dead and
[rapture](Rapture "Rapture") the living believers from the Earth.
After this, a seven year period of
[tribulation](Tribulation "Tribulation") occurs, climaxing in the
Battle of Armageddon. In the second step, Christ intervenes at the
Battle of Armageddon and establishes a literal 1000-year millennial
kingdom on earth. As such, some Dispensationalists are often
associated with the circulation of end times
[prophecy](Prophecy "Prophecy"), which professes to read omens of
the Second Coming in current events; however, other
Dispensationalists have criticized this apocalypticism popularized
by authors such as Hal Lindsey.

### Premillennialism and dispensationalism

By way of clarification, it should be noted that while all
dispensationalists are by definition
[premillennial](Premillennialism "Premillennialism") in their
eschatology, not all premillennialists are dispensational in their
theology. Historic Premillennialism (e.g. in
[George Eldon Ladd](George_Eldon_Ladd "George Eldon Ladd")) rejects
pre-tribulationalism, dispensationalism's radical tenets, and its
uniquely Jewish view of the 1000 year millennium. Historic
premillennialism may be traced back to some of the early church
fathers where it was sometimes termed "chiliasm."

*See main article [Premillennialism](Premillennialism "Premillennialism").*
## Dispensational theology in Christianity at large

Prior to dispensationalism,
[Covenant theology](Covenant_theology "Covenant theology") was the
prominent [Protestant](Protestantism "Protestantism") view
regarding redemptive history and is still the view of the Reformed
churches. A relatively recent view, which is seen as a third
alternative, especially among Calvinistic Baptists, is called
[New Covenant Theology](New_Covenant_Theology "New Covenant Theology").
Outside of Protestantism, however, other Christian branches (e.g.,
Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, or Roman Catholicism) have
not embraced any form of dispensationalism.

## Progressive dispensationalism

"Progressive Dispensationalism" by Blaising and Bock (Baker Books,
1993) introduced a movement showing that progressives within the
dispensationalist camp have resolved many of the issues upon which
classic Dispensational theology has been attacked -- especially by
Reformed theology. However, some have questioned whether these
progressives, having abandoned certain crucial tenets, can fairly
continue to call themselves dispensationalists at
all.^[[5]](#note-4)^

*See main article [Progressive dispensationalism](Progressive_dispensationalism "Progressive dispensationalism").*
## Acts 28 and Mid-Acts dispensationalism

Other varieties of dispensationalism include the "Acts-28
Dispensationalism" of
[E. W. Bullinger](E._W._Bullinger "E. W. Bullinger") (1837-1913)
and the Acts-13, or Mid-Acts, Dispensationalists, represented by J.
C. O'Hair, C. R. Stam (*Things That Differ*), and Charles F. Baker
(*A Dispensational Theology*). The latter group also refers to
itself as "The Grace Movement." These varieties are discussed in
the main article on
[Hyper-dispensationalism](Hyper-dispensationalism "Hyper-dispensationalism").

    distinctions between the church and Israel are purposely blurred,
    and the doctrine seems to move in the direction of Amillennialism
    which, of course, does away with the Pre-Tribulation Rapture, the
    whole Millennial Kingdom, the importance of modern Israel and
    virtually all of the basics of accurate eschatological teaching.
    They claim to be Dispensationalists, but have gutted
    Dispensationalism of some of its most important concepts."
