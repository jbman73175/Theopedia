**Divine accommodation** means that [God](God "God") has
accommodated various truths so they can be comprehended by the
human mind. In its connection to biblical interpretation, "the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") is to be interpreted in view of the fact
that it is an accommodation of Divine truths to human minds: God
the infinite communicating with man the finite... We must be
careful, then, not to push accommodating language about God and His
nature to literal extremes. God does not have feathers and wings
(e.g., Psalms 17:8); nor is He our literal Father in the same sense
our earthly father is." ^[[1]](#note-0)^ The idea of divine
accommodation is usually associated with the theology of the
Protestant Reformer [John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin").
