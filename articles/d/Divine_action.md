**Divine action** is a topic in
[philosophical theology](Philosophical_theology "Philosophical theology")
seeking to understand the relationship between the natural sciences
and the concept of [God](God "God") acting in the world --
primarily of interest to scientifically inclined theologians and
theologically inclined scientists. Some theologians, and many
scientists, maintain that the idea of divine intervention is at
odds with the framework of natural laws disclosed by science.
However, other theologians argue that classical
[Theism](Theism "Theism") is not necessarily incompatible with the
scientific world.
[Alvin Plantinga](Alvin_Plantinga "Alvin Plantinga"), for example,
contends that "this notion of a *religion/science problem* is
misguided. When properly understood, neither the classical
(Newtonian) picture of natural laws, nor the more recent quantum
mechanical picture, rules out divine intervention. There is nothing
in science, under either the old or the new picture, that conflicts
with, or even calls in to question, special divine action,
including miracles."^[[1]](#note-0)^

According to the Oxford University Regius Professor of Divinity
Keith Ward, the topic of Divine action includes the Old Testament
accounts of Israel's liberation from Egypt, their guidance through
the wilderness by a pillar of cloud and fire, their victory over
their enemies by God's sending of plagues and earthquakes, the
Lord's allowance of His people to be taken into excile because of
their sins, and His aid in returning them to the promised land 70
years later. Also according to Ward, the topic includes the New
Testament record of the life, death, and resurrection of
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), Christians who today
pray by God's command, and this very living God who will act to
heal, convert, and empower human lives.^[[2]](#note-1)^
