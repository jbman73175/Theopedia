*"While the apostles were still surviving, while Christ's blood was still fresh in Judea, the Lord's body was asserted to be but a phantasm." -Jerome*

Docetism is the belief that
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") did not have a physical
body; rather, that his body was an illusion, as was his
crucifixion.

This belief is most commonly attributed to the
[Gnostics](Gnosticism "Gnosticism"), who believed that matter was
evil, and hence that God would not take on a material body. This
sort of statement, however, is rooted in the idea that a divine
spark is imprisoned within the material body and that the material
body is in itself an obstacle that prevents man from seeing his
divine origin. Humanity is in essence asleep. It could be further
explained as this — the human body is temporary, and the spirit is
eternal—therefore, to say that the body of Jesus was an illusion
and that his crucifixion was as well, could be compared to the same
way a Buddhist speaks about illusion: illusion is everything that
is temporary, not everything that is not real. Even so, saying that
the human body is temporary has a tendency to undercut the
importance of the belief in resurrection of the dead and the
goodness of created matter, and is in opposition to the orthodox
view.
