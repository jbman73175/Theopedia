"**Doctrine** is the term generally given to the body of teachings
that result from... [weaving] together the various strands of the
biblical witness, integrating them into a coherent
[systematic account](Systematic_theology "Systematic theology") of
the Christian vision of reality." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

The term doctrine refers to that which is taught. The
[Greek](Greek "Greek") word in the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") is *didaskalia*, and
it is variously translated as teaching, instruction, or doctrine.
Christians use it to describe the basic
[theology](Theology "Theology") which is understood to be the
teaching of the [Bible](Bible "Bible"). In this sense it represents
the content of the Christian faith.

Doctrine is important. Scripture stresses the importance of sound
doctrine. In the pastoral epistles there are 28 specific references
to the importance of doctrine or the content of our teaching. For
example,

-   "Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of
    Scripture, to exhortation, to *teaching* [i.e. doctrine]" (1 Tim.
    4:13).
-   "preach the word; be ready in season and out of season;
    ﻿reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching.
    For the time is coming when people will not endure
    *sound﻿ teaching*, but having itching ears they will accumulate for
    themselves teachers to suit their own passions," (2 Tim. 4:2-3).
-   "Keep a close watch on yourself and on the *teaching*. Persist
    in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your
    hearers" (1 Tim. 4:16).
-   "He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that
    he may be able to give instruction in *sound doctrine* and also to
    rebuke those who contradict it" (Titus 1:9).
