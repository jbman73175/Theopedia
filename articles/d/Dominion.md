The concept of **dominion** is one of the key themes in the
biblical account of the relationship between
[mankind](Humanity "Humanity") and the rest of the material
[creation](Creation "Creation"). It is a consequence of being
created in the [image of God](Image_of_God "Image of God"), and has
links to the biblical witness of [Christ](Christ "Christ").

## Source

The source of man's authority over the world is located in the one
who created both. [God](God "God"), when proposing to create man,
said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let
them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of
the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over
every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
([Gen.](Genesis "Genesis") 1:26) Man, therefore, is not autonomous
in his dominion, but subject to God. Further than that, however, we
see that the source of man's dominion is in the fact that he is
created in the image of God. ^[[1]](#note-0)^ As a result, this
will provide boundaries to our dominion.

## Nature

The understanding of the nature of man's dominion is something
which has been moving over the last decades. The emphasis in
previous centuries was on a man-centred understanding of creation,
leading to a man-centred view of authority. Perhaps
[Calvin](Calvin "Calvin") most succinctly expresses this view when
he says, "And hence we infer what was the end for which all things
were created; namely, that none of the conveniences and necessities
of life might be wanting to men."^[[2]](#note-1)^ This view sees
creation as existing for man's benefit, and so sees extracting
value from the world as being of prime importance. Carried to
extremes, it could suggest that anything mankind can do to extract
value from the world around is legitimate. Although this latter
view has been and is current in some parts of the Christian church,
most proponents of this understanding of creation—and consequently,
of man's dominion—have taken a far more nuanced view. Indeed, not
much further on from the previous quotation, Calvin wrote, "let
every one regard himself as the steward of God in all things which
he possesses. Then he will … [not] corrupt by abuse those things
which God requires to be preserved."^[[3]](#note-2)^

Modern ecological concerns have led some theologians to propose
that we must radically re-cast our understanding of nature, and
move to an "ecocentric" view of creation, where the whole of
creation is counted equally. However, some twentieth-century
scholars, rejecting the "anthropocentric" model as inadequate and
viewing the "ecocentric" view of creation as tantamount to
[pantheism](Pantheism "Pantheism")^[[4]](#note-3)^^[[5]](#note-4)^,
have proposed a modified reading of the concept of dominion. They
suggest that we should understand man's relationship to creation in
terms which are "theocentric". For instance, Bullmore writes that,
"It is not primarily for our own well-being that we rule over
creation but for God."^[[6]](#note-5)^

As an example of the effects of this change in reading, Blocher,
commenting on the nature of man's dominion, explains that "like a
shepherd will he rule the animals, with a view to their own welfare
as well as to his own."^[[7]](#note-6)^ By comparing man's role to
that of the shepherd, he hints that we can only understand our
dominion in the light of the dominion of the Good Shepherd. Thus,
to understand what biblical dominion is, we must look to Jesus.
Bullmore^[[8]](#note-7)^ quotes Dyrness as pointing us forward from
the dominion of Genesis 1 to the dominion that a godly king is to
exercise in Deuteronomy, and to the dominion of the godly king in
Psalm 72. We may add Psalm 8 and its commentary in Hebrews, which
don't treat of dominion specifically, but do bear on the basic
question of man's relationship to the rest of creation. These
passages, in turn point forward directly to Christ, who is the
godly king, ruling in righteousness and justice. He is the king who
builds his people up with love and gentleness; he prunes his people
for growth; and he gives all that he has for their benefit.

## Effects of the Fall

In Genesis 3, we see clearly that [the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall")
affects man's dominion, in two ways. Firstly, man's ability to
understand his work is diminished; this follows as one of the
noetic effects of the Fall. However, the effect which Genesis, and
[Romans](Romans "Romans") 8, explicitly teaches is that the ground
itself is cursed because of us. Thus, we cannot say, as have some
scholars, that our problems in exercising dominion rightly are
solely because *we* are out of touch with nature. Human folly makes
it quite obvious that we are; but *nature* is also out of touch
with itself.

## Future hope

It is to this truth, of nature out of touch with itself, that
Bullmore turns in his final section^[[9]](#note-8)^, as he treats
of Romans 8. For God subjected the whole creation to frustration,
writes Paul, so that one day it may enjoy the freedom of the sons
of God. Creation groans, as though in childbirth, and one day,
Paul's imagery implies, the new creation will be born out of the
old. The implications for our attitude towards dominion are
striking: creation is waiting with us for the final redemption. We
do not exercise our dominion in vain, but await our Saviour from
heaven, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will complete his new creation.
