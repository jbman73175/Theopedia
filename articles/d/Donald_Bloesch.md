## A middle ground

Donald Bloesch, characterizing himself a "progressive evangelical"
or "ecumenical orthodoxy",^[[1]](#note-0)^ has attempted to find a
middle ground between
[Neo-orthodoxy](Neo-orthodoxy "Neo-orthodoxy"), on the one hand,
and "right wing" [orthodoxy](Orthodox "Orthodox") on the other
hand. He claims to have a very high view of Scripture, denounces
[liberalism](Liberalism "Liberalism"), and calls for a creedal
theology based upon Holy Scripture. He insists on the primacy of
Scripture over "religious experiences," and denies that the
[Apocrypha](Apocrypha "Apocrypha") and church tradition have an
equal standing with the [Bible](Bible "Bible").
[Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth") and
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") loom large across the
pages of his works.
