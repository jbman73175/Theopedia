The **Douay-Rheims Bible** was published by the English College at
Rheims in two stages, first the NT in 1582, and later the OT in
1609; with later revisions done by Bishop Richard Challoner in
1749-1752. Rather than a translation from the original languages
the Douay-Rheims is a literal translation of the
[Latin Vulgate](Vulgate "Vulgate"), which was declared the only
official version of the Catholic Church in 1546, and represents the
first translation of the Bible into english. Being a Catholic
version, it generally includes the the seven Deutero-Canonical
books (also known as the [Apocrypha](Apocrypha "Apocrypha")).
