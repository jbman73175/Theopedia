**Double Imputation** is a doctrine related to
[Justification](Justification "Justification"), which views the
concept of [imputation](Imputation "Imputation") as applying both
to Christ and believers. On the one hand, *our sins* are imputed to
Christ who bore them on the cross. On the other hand,
*Christ's righteousness* is imputed to believers whereby they are
seen by God as cloaked in the righteousness of Christ.
Justification, in this view, is based on Christ's
[propitiatory sacrifice](Propitiation "Propitiation") as well as
his personal righteousness imputed to believers, not any
righteousness inherent or infused in man.
