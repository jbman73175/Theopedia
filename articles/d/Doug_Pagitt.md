Doug Pagitt
**Doug Pagitt** (b. 1966) is the pastor of Solomon's Porch in
Minneapolis, Minnesota. He is a popular speaker, author of several
books, general editor of the forth-coming *An Emergent Manifesto*,
and an influential voice in the
[Emergent church](Emergent_church "Emergent church") movement.

Pagitt studied anthropology at Bethel College, earned an MA in
Theology from Bethel Seminary, and has been the pastor of Solomon's
Porch, described as "a holistic, missional Christian community",
since its inception in January 2000. He is also a Senior Fellow
with [Emergent Village](http://www.emergentvillage.com), described
as "a growing, generative friendship among missional Christians
seeking to love our world in the Spirit of Jesus Christ".

Pagitt asserts that pastors must be intimately involved in the life
of the community and approach preaching less as one-way speach and
more as "progressional dialogue". His ministry models have received
criticism, in particluar from 'emerging' but
now-shunning-'emergent' pastor
[Mark Driscoll](Mark_Driscoll "Mark Driscoll")
(*Confessions of a Reformission Rev.: Hard Lessons from an Emerging Missional Church*,
Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2006), and from others such as
[Apprising Ministries](http://www.apprising.org/archives/2006/07/doug_pagitt_doe.html).
