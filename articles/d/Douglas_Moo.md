## N. T. Wright on Moo

"Moo is in a different category again. Doug Moo, I would say, is a
much greater Pauline scholar than either of the two I just
mentioned [D. A. Carson and John Piper]. One of the things I really
respect about Doug Moo is that he is constantly grappling with the
text. Where he hears the text saying something which is not what
his tradition would have said, he will go with the text. I won’t
always agree with his exegesis, but there is a relentless scholarly
honesty about him which I really tip my hat off to."
