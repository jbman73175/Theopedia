To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you
before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy â€“ to
the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority,
through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and
forevermore! Amen (Jude 24:25 [NIV](NIV "NIV"))
