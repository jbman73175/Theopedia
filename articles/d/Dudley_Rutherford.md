Unusually for a church leader, Rutherford has led a church into
unity with another denomination. Shepherd of the Hills (formerly
Van Nuys First Baptist Church) moved to Porter Ranch, CA in 1991
under the leadership of Jess Moody. Dudley Rutherford had moved to
California in 1985 to pastor Hillcrest Christian Church. By 1991,
Hillcrest had an attendance of over 1,000 while Shepherd was
struggling. In 1995, Jess Moody decided to retire, and approached
Dudley Rutherford about merging the two churches. It was agreed
upon, and the two churches united as Shepherd of the Hills Church
with 1,600 in
attendance.[[1]](http://www.theshepherd.org/merg.html)
