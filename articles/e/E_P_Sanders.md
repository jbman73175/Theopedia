## Background

Sanders was born and grew up in Grand Prairie, Texas. He attended
Wesleyan College, Fort Worth (1955-1959) and Perkins School of
Theology at Southern Methodist University, Dallas (1959-1962). He
spent a year (1962-1963) studying at Gottingen, the University of
Oxford and in Jerusalem.

Between September 1963 and May 1966 Sanders studied at Union
Theological Seminary, New York for his Th.D. His thesis was
entitled *The Tendencies of the Synoptic Tradition* (published in
1969), which used "form criticism" to examine whether the Gospel
tradition changed in consistent ways.

He was a professor at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario),
where he taught from 1966 to 1984. In 1968 he won a fellowship from
the Canada Council and spent a year in Israel, studying Rabbinical
Judaism.

In 1984 he became Dean Ireland's Professor of Exegesis at the
University of Oxford and a Fellow of Queen's College, positions he
kept until his move to Duke University in 1990. He has also held
visiting professorships and lectureships at Trinity College,
Dublin, and the University of Cambridge.
