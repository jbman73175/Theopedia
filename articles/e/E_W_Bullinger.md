## Life and Work

Born in Canterbury, England, his family traced its lineage back to
the noted Swiss reformer
[Heinrich Bullinger](Heinrich_Bullinger "Heinrich Bullinger")
(1504-1557). He was educated at King's College, London, and gained
recognition in the field of Biblical languages.

E.W. Bullinger was noted broadly for three works:
*A Critical Lexicon and Concordance to the English and Greek New Testament*
(1877); for his ground-breaking and exhaustive work on
*Figures of Speech Used in the Bible* (1898); and as the primary
editor of *The Companion Bible* (published in 6 parts, beginning in
1909; the entire annotated Bible was published posthumously in
1922). These works and many others remain in print (2004).

In 1881, four years after the publication of the
*Lexicon and Concordance*, Archibald Campbell Tait, Archbishop of
Canterbury conferred upon Bullinger a Doctor of Divinity degree,
citing Bullinger's "eminent service in the Church in the department
of Biblical criticism."

## Theology

Bullinger's theology was extreme
[dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") on which
he wrote numerous articles which appeared in his Monthly Journal
*Things to Come*. His name has become virtually synonymous with
[Hyper-dispensationalism](Hyper-dispensationalism "Hyper-dispensationalism").

He described **dispensations** as divine "administrations" or
"arrangements" wherein God deals at distinct time periods and with
distinct groups of people "on distinct principles, and the doctrine
relating to each must be kept distinct." He emphasizes that
"Nothing but confusion can arise from reading into one dispensation
that which relates to another." {*Companion Bible*, Appendix 181}

The term *hyper*- or *ultradispensational* refers to the relatively
late date ascribed to the beginning of the current dispensation and
as well, perhaps, to the great emphasis believers place on the
concept. Bullinger places the beginning of "the church" (the "Body
of Christ") not at Pentecost but at a point in
[Paul](Paul "Paul")'s ministry after his arrival at Rome (as
described in [Acts](Acts "Acts"), chapter 28) and just before he is
believed to have written the
[Epistle to the Ephesians](Epistle_to_the_Ephesians "Epistle to the Ephesians").
The particular significance of Ephesians is that it reveals the
"great mystery", that "the Gentiles [would] be joint-heirs [with
the Jews], and a joint-body and (joint) partakers of the promise in
Christ through the gospel". In addition it makes clear that this is
an ancient secret, long part of God's plan, but only then newly
(i.e., very recently, in Bullinger's opinion) revealed.
{*Companion Bible*, Appendix 193}

Perhaps one of the more interesting aspects of this doctrine is
that it apparently has implications for the applicability of the
majority of New Testament scripture (the Gospels and the earlier,
"Acts period" Epistles) to the church, since those writings consist
of material which is considered to have been addressed to the
people of the *previous* dispensation (i.e., "'earthly' or ethnic
Israel").
