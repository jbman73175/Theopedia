The **Church Fathers** or **Fathers of the Church** are the early
and influential theologians and writers in the Christian Church,
particularly those of the first five centuries of Christian
history. The term means specifically writers and teachers of the
Church, not saints in general; usually it is not meant to include
the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") authors. "In the
late second century [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") stated simply,
'He who has received the teaching from another's mouth is called
the son of his instructor, and he is called his father.'
[Clement of Alexandria](Clement_of_Alexandria "Clement of Alexandria")
elaborated thus: 'Words are the progeny of the soul. Hence, we call
those that instructed us fathers... and everyone who is instructed
is in respect of subjection the son of his instructor" (Hall,
*Reading Scripture with the Church Fathers*, p. 50). The study of
Church Fathers is commonly known as **Patristics**.

### Apostolic Fathers

The very earliest Church Fathers, of the first two generations
after the Apostles of Christ, are usually called the
[Apostolic Fathers](Apostolic_Fathers "Apostolic Fathers").
Familiar names during this period could be
[Clement of Rome](Clement_of_Rome "Clement of Rome") and
[Ignatius of Antioch](Ignatius_of_Antioch "Ignatius of Antioch")
among others.

### The Apologists

Later, in contact with Greek Philosophy and Literature while facing
persecutions, there began a period called the
[Apologists](Apologetics "Apologetics") (sometimes called
Apologetic Fathers) who tried to justify and defend the Christian
doctrine against attacks from within the Hellenistic world. Well
known Apologists of this era are
[Justin Martyr](Justin_Martyr "Justin Martyr") and
[Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian").

### Latin and Greek Fathers

Those fathers who wrote in Latin are called the Latin Fathers, and
those who wrote in Greek the Greek Fathers. Famous Latin Fathers
include the
[Augustine of Hippo](Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo") and
[Ambrose of Milan](Ambrose_of_Milan "Ambrose of Milan"); famous
Greek Fathers include
[Irenaeus of Lyons](Irenaeus_of_Lyons "Irenaeus of Lyons") (whose
work has oddly survived only in Latin translation) and
[Athanasius of Alexandria](Athanasius_of_Alexandria "Athanasius of Alexandria")
among others.

### Desert Fathers

The Desert Fathers were early monastics living in the Egyptian
desert. Although they did not write as often, their teachings had
great influence. Among them are Anthony the Great and Pachomius. A
great number of their usually short sayings is collected in the
*Apophthegmata Patrum.*
