The **Eastern Orthodox Church** is a body of eastern churches
adhering to the first seven
[Ecumenical councils](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils"),
and from whom the western churches broke away in the
[Great Schism](Great_Schism "Great Schism") of 1054.

The present-day influence of the Orthodox Church encompasses the
territories associated with the former Byzantine and Russian
empires: Eastern Europe, Asia (Russia/Siberia), parts of the Middle
East and Africa. Worldwide, the Eastern Orthodox Church is
estimated to have between 200 and 300 million members. Today, the
strongest Orthodox influence can be seen in the Greek Orthodox
Church and the Russian Orthodox Church and it has a presence in
many countries, with large communities in the USA and Australia.

### The Great Schism

In the 11th century the "Great Schism" took place between Rome and
Constantinople, which led to separation of the Churches of the West
(which became the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")),
and the Churches of the East (which became the
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox") Church).
There were doctrinal issues such as the
[filioque clause](Filioque_clause "Filioque clause") in the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") and the authority of
the Pope involved in the split, but these were exacerbated by
cultural and linguistic differences. Though normally dated to 1054,
when Pope Leo IX and Patriarch Michael I excommunicated each other,
the East-West Schism was actually the result of an extended period
of estrangement between the two bodies of churches.

The final breach is often considered to have arisen after the
sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. This
Fourth Crusade had the Latin Church directly involved in a military
assault against the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople, and the
Orthodox Patriarchate. The sacking of the Church of Holy Wisdom and
establishment of the Latin Empire in 1204 is viewed with some
rancor to the present day. In 2004, Pope John Paul II extended a
formal apology for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204; the
apology was formally accepted by Patriarch Bartholomew of
Constantinople.

In 1453, the last of the Roman Empire (with its capital at
Constantinople) fell to the Ottoman Turks. By this time Egypt had
been under Muslim control for some seven centuries, but Orthodoxy
was very strong in Russia; and so Moscow, called the Third Rome,
became a major new center of the Church at that time.
