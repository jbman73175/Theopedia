**Eberhard Jüngel** (b. 1933) is a German
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian") and Professor of Systematic
Theology and Philosophy of Religion at the University of Tübingen,
Germany. He is a contemporary and colleague of
[Jürgen Moltmann](Jürgen_Moltmann "Jürgen Moltmann"),
[Wolfhart Pannenberg](Wolfhart_Pannenberg "Wolfhart Pannenberg"),
and is considered in the German-speaking world to be a thinker of
comparable stature to these theologians. His dense, sometimes
Heideggerian prose is not easily translated, and his own lack of
English (he was raised in East Germany) has stood in the way of
similar recognition in the English-speaking world. He has been
influenced by [Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth") (he is perhaps
the most significant heir of Barth writing today),
[Rudolf Bultmann](Rudolf_Bultmann "Rudolf Bultmann") and
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"), as well as
philosophers G.W.F. Hegel and Martin Heidegger.

Much of Jüngel's significant work finds expression in dense
theological essays, of which five volumes have been published to
date (two have been translated into English:
[John Webster](John_Webster "John Webster") has translated volume 1
of *Theological Essays* and Arnold Neufeldt-Fast has translated
volume 2, edited by John Webster). Jüngel's interest centers around
a theology of language or hermeneutic theology. From his teachers
Ernst Fuchs and Gerhard Ebeling he has borrowed an understanding of
the gospel as a "word event", a concept he goes on to develop in
dialogue with the philosophical tradition (see especially his essay
on *Metaphorical Truth*, translated in Webster's collection).
Jüngel's magnum opus, *God as the Mystery of the World*, appeared
in 1977 (Siebeck; Eerdmans, 1983). Starting with a detailed
critique of the common premises of both
[classical theism](index.php?title=Classical_theism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Classical theism (page does not exist)")
and modern [atheism](Atheism "Atheism"), he develops a trinitarian
account of God explicated in terms of love. His early volume on
Barth's doctrine of [God](God "God"), *God's Being is in Becoming*
is a compact and dense reading of Barth. More recently, Jüngel
became engaged in the debate around the
[Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran") -
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic")
[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification](Joint_Declaration_on_the_Doctrine_of_Justification "Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification"),
where his critique of an earlier draft was influential. A fruit of
this debate was his fairly accessible volume on
*The Gospel of Justification*.
