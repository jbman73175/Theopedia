**Ebionitism** was an early [heresy](Heresy "Heresy"). The
*Ebionites* were a first century Jewish-Christian sect. They
emphasized Jewish law and rejected the teachings of the Apostle
[Paul](Paul "Paul"). Most considered Jesus to be a man, not God.

Later use of this term refers to anyone who minimizes the divinity
of Christ.
