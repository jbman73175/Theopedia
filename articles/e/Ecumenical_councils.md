In [early church](Early_church "Early church") history, an
**ecumenical council** was a meeting of the bishops of the whole
church convened to discuss and settle matters of Church doctrine
and practice.

## Council documents

Church councils were, from the beginning, bureaucratic exercises.
Written documents were circulated, speeches made and responded to,
votes taken, and final documents published and distributed. A large
part of what we know about the beliefs of
[heresies](Heresy "Heresy") comes from the documents quoted in
councils in order to be refuted, or indeed only from the deductions
based on the refutations. For all councils, Canons (or rulings)
were published and survive. In some cases other documentation
survives as well. Study of the canons of church councils is the
foundation of the development of canon law, especially the
reconciling of seemingly contradictory canons or the determination
of priority between them. Canons consist of doctrinal statements
and disciplinary measures — most Church councils and local synods
dealt with immediate disciplinary concerns as well as major
difficulties of doctrine.
[Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy")
typically views the purely doctrinal canons as dogmatic and
applicable to the entire church at all times, while the
disciplinary canons are the application of those dogmas in a
particular time and place; these canons may or may not be
applicable in other situations.

## List of the first seven ecumenical councils

Only the first seven councils are summarized here as these have the
most relevance to Protestant Christianity. Other subsequent
councils are of particular interest only to Roman Catholicism and
Eastern Orthodoxy.

1.  [First Council of Nicaea](First_Council_of_Nicaea "First Council of Nicaea"),
    (325): affirmed that Jesus is truly God and equal to the Father;
    repudiated [Arianism](Arianism "Arianism"), adopted the
    [Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed").
2.  [First Council of Constantinople](First_Council_of_Constantinople "First Council of Constantinople"),
    (381): affirmed that Jesus was perfectly man against the
    [Apollinarians](Apollinarianism "Apollinarianism"); revised the
    [Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") into its present form
    which is used in the [Eastern](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox")
    and [Oriental Orthodox](Oriental_Orthodox "Oriental Orthodox")
    churches; prohibited any further alteration of the Creed without
    the assent of an Ecumenical Council.
3.  [Council of Ephesus](Council_of_Ephesus "Council of Ephesus"),
    (431): affirmed that Jesus is one person against
    [Nestorianism](Nestorianism "Nestorianism"); proclaimed the
    [Virgin Mary](Virgin_Mary "Virgin Mary") as the Mother of God, and
    also condemned [Pelagianism](Pelagianism "Pelagianism").
4.  [Council of Chalcedon](Council_of_Chalcedon "Council of Chalcedon"),
    (451): affirmed that in Jesus there are two distinct natures in one
    person that are
    [hypostatically united](Hypostatic_union "Hypostatic union")
    "without confusion, change, division or separation"; repudiated the
    [Eutychianism](Eutychianism "Eutychianism") and
    [Monophysitism](Monophysitism "Monophysitism"); adopted the
    [Chalcedonian Creed](Chalcedonian_Creed "Chalcedonian Creed").
5.  Second Council of Constantinople, (553): reaffirmed decisions
    and doctrines explicated by previous Councils, condemned new Arian,
    Nestorian, and Monophysite writings.
6.  Third Council of Constantinople, (680–681): asserted that Jesus
    had both a divine and human will; repudiated
    [Monothelitism](Monothelitism "Monothelitism").
7.  Second Council of Nicaea, (787); restoration of the veneration
    of icons and end of the first
    [iconoclasm](index.php?title=Iconoclasm&action=edit&redlink=1 "Iconoclasm (page does not exist)").
    It is rejected by some Protestant denominations, who instead prefer
    the Council of Hieria (754), which had also described itself as the
    Seventh Ecumenical Council and had condemned the veneration of
    icons.

### Protestantism and the seven ecumenical councils

Many [Protestants](Protestantism "Protestantism") (especially those
belonging to the magisterial traditions, such as
[Lutheranism](Lutheranism "Lutheranism") and
[Anglicanism](Anglicanism "Anglicanism")) accept the teachings of
the first seven councils, but do not ascribe to the councils
themselves the same authority as Roman Catholics and the Eastern
Orthodox do. Supporters of the councils contend that they did not
create new doctrines but merely elucidated doctrines already in
Scripture that had been misinterpreted by heretics. The primary
value of these early ecumenical councils is their documentation of
the early consensus of doctrines regarding the nature of Christ and
the Godhead.
