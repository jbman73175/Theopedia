**Ecumenism** (noun) refers to a movement or effort promoting unity
among Christian churches or denominations. In a more general sense,
it may also refer to movements promoting worldwide unity among the
various religions through greater cooperation and improved
understanding. The idea is normally expressed in its adjective
form, **ecumenical**, in terms such as "ecumenical thinking,"
"ecumenical activities," or "the ecumenical movement."

In a special sense it is used of the early church councils, terming
them as
[Ecumenical councils](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils"),
because they were recognized and adopted by the early church at
large.

Critics of the "modern ecumenical movement" see it as largely
giving up on the issue of truth and theological doctrine. It
concentrates on getting everyone together outwardly, under
compromise formulas like
[Evangelicals and Catholics Together](http://www.leaderu.com/ect/ectmenu.html),
the recent Lutheran-Vatican
[Joint Declaration on Justification](http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_31101999_cath-luth-joint-declaration_en.html),
and ecumenical activities such as found in
[Promise Keepers](http://www.promisekeepers.org/about).
