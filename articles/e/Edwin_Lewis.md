**Edwin Lewis** (1881-1959) was an American
[Methodist](Methodism "Methodism") theologian primarily associated
with Drew University in New Jersey.

Born in Great Britain, Lewis traveled to Canada as a
[missionary](Missiology "Missiology") before continuing his
education in the United States. He eventually became a professor of
theology at Drew.

Lewis' early work demonstrates the influence of
[Boston personalism](index.php?title=Boston_personalism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Boston personalism (page does not exist)"),
a school of [Protestant liberal theology](Liberalism "Liberalism")
widespread among Methodists during the first half of the 20th
century, and British idealism. His book
*Jesus Christ and the Human Quest* is an example of his early
perspective. In the book, Lewis argues that the Christian faith has
its foundation in the nature of persons and personhood.

In 1929 he was named editor of the *Abingdon Bible Commentary*.
While preparing the massive reference work, Lewis claimed to have
"rediscovered the Bible" for himself. He reacted strongly to the
1931 *Laymen's Missionary Report*, which he believed hampered the
Christian missionary effort, in his article "The Re-thought
Theology of the Re-thinking of Missions" which appeared in the
*Christian Century*.

Growing more suspicious of the subjective theological liberalism of
the day, he published *A Christian Manifesto* in 1934. In the book,
Lewis railed against liberal theology (which he referred to as
*modernism*), reasserting classical Christian themes such as the
transcendence of God, the
[sinfulness of humankind](Total_depravity "Total depravity"), the
[divinity of Christ](Christology "Christology"), and the
[objective work of the atonement](Atonement "Atonement").

Lewis wrote: "No statement of Christian belief which does not
include a supernatural reference...is a true
statement."^[[1]](#note-0)^

He followed *A Christian Manifesto* with
*A Philosophy of Christian Revelation* and
*The Creator and the Adversary*, both of which continued his
reclamation of Christian orthodoxy from an
[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") perspective. Lewis argued
that Gods triumphs over evil by outsuffering and outloving his
adversary.^[[2]](#note-1)^

Lewis' work proved infuential to an entire generation of Methodist
theologians, notably Carl Michalson and
[Albert C. Outler](Albert_C._Outler "Albert C. Outler").
