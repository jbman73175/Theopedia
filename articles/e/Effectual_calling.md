*A term used to describe that part of the ordo salutis (order of salvation) in which the people of God are graciously summoned into the fellowship of Christ and united to Him by faith. In effectual calling God calls them whom he has predestinated to eternal life by his Word and Spirit, out of their state of sin and death. They are regenerated by the work of the Holy Spirit and their wills are renewed and made willing and able to answer the call to come to Christ, which they will most certainly do. The basis of effectual calling is God's grace and not any perceived quality in the individual called.*
