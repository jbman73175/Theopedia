**Egalitarianism**, within Christianity, is a movement based on the
theological view that not only are all people equal before God in
their personhood, but there are no gender-based limitations of what
functions or roles each can fulfill in the home, the church, and
the society. It is sometimes referred to as **biblical equality.**
Egalitarians understand the Bible as teaching the fundamental
equality of women and men of all racial and ethnic groups, all
economic classes, and all age groups, based on the teachings and
example of Jesus Christ. It should not be confused with secular
political, economic, social egalitarianism.

Among evangelicals, particularly in the last few decades, two
rather different paradigms concerning roles of men and women
presented in Scripture have emerged.

-   One is *Complementarianism* which holds the theological view
    that although men and women are created equal in their being and
    personhood, they are created to complement each other via different
    roles in life and in the church.
-   The other view is Christian *Egalitarianism* which is presented
    in this article.

## Etymology

The term *Egalitarian* is derived from the French word *égal*,
meaning "equal." Thus, it involves affirming, promoting, or
believing in equal rights for all people. It is the hermeneutical
hypothesis, based on interpretations of scripture, that men and
women are designed by their Creator to have no gender-based
limitations of what functions or roles each can fulfill in the
home, the church, and the society. The egalitarian view is that
there are no roles or responsibilities that uniquely fall to the
male, no limitations of what functions the female can fulfill in
the home, the church, and the society. According to this view,
women as well as men can serve as pastors, elders, deacons, etc.,
in light of passages like Galatians 3:28.

## The Egalitarian position

Egalitarians' interpretation of Scripture brings them to the
conclusion that the manner and teachings of Jesus, affirmed by the
Apostle Paul, abolished gender-specific roles in both the church
and in marriage. Accordingly, this view teaches that God calls
believers to roles and ministries in the church without regard to
class, gender, or race,^[[1]](#note-0)^ and all have *equal*
responsibility to use their gifts and obey their calling to the
glory of God, with no limitations or privileges according to
gender. They conclude that male headship is not biblically-ordained
either in the home or in the Church.

The Egalitarian position is usually characterized by:

-   Belief that the Bible teaches the full equality of men and
    women in Creation and in Redemption (Gen 1:26-28, 2:23, 5:1-2; 1
    Cor 11:11-12; Gal 3:13, 28, 5:1). Both man and woman were created
    in God’s image, had a direct relationship with God, and shared
    jointly the responsibilities of bearing and rearing children and
    having dominion over the created order (Gen 1:26-28).
-   Belief that both woman and man were created for full and equal
    partnership. The word “helper” (ezer) used to designate woman in
    Genesis 2:18 refers to God in most instances of Old Testament usage
    (e.g,. 1 Sam 7:12; Ps 121:1-2). Consequently, the word conveys no
    implication whatsoever of female subordination or inferiority.
-   Belief that man and woman were co-participants in the Fall:
    Adam was no less culpable than Eve (Gen 3:6; Rom 5:12-21; 1 Cor
    15:21-22).
-   Belief that husbands and wives are joint heirs together of the
    grace of life and that they are bound together in a relationship of
    mutual submission and responsibility (1 Cor 7:3-5; Eph 5:21; 1
    Peter 3:1-7; Gen 21:12).
-   Belief that both mothers and fathers are to exercise leadership
    in the nurture, training, discipline and teaching of their children
    (Ex 20:12; Lev 19:3; Deut 6:6-9, 21:18-21, 27:16; Prov 1:8, 6:20;
    Eph 6:1-4; Col 3:20; 2 Tim 1:5; see also Luke 2:51).

According to Complementarian authors Piper and Grudem, the vast
majority of evangelicals have not endorsed the evangelical
Egalitarian position, "sensing that it does not really reflect the
pattern of Biblical truth." Yet, they write that "most Christians
will admit that selfishness, irresponsibility, passivity, and abuse
have often contaminated 'traditional' patterns of how men and women
relate to each other."^[[2]](#note-RBMW)^

While far from agreeing with Egalitarian positions, Piper and
Grudem affirm the evangelical Christian commitment of the leading
Egalitarian authors:

> Christian egalitarian authors differ from secular feminists because
> they do not reject the Bible’s authority or truthfulness. They base
> their conclusions about egalitarianism using careful, but sometimes
> different, exegesis of the Bible. They may be called “evangelical
> feminists” because by personal commitment to Jesus Christ and by
> profession of belief in the total truthfulness of Scripture they
> still identify themselves very clearly with evangelicalism. Their
> arguments have been detailed, earnest, and persuasive to many
> Christians. {{\#if:John Piper and Wayne Grudem^[[2]](#note-RBMW)^|
> – John Piper and Wayne Grudem^[[2]](#note-RBMW)^{{\#if:|,

Egalitarians teach that roles in the church and home are to be
*gift*-based rather than *gender*-based. They advocate for mutual
submission within marriage as well as the ordination of women as
pastors, elders, and other authoritative teaching positions within
the body of Christ. Egalitarians deny that any differences related
to gender call for strictly prescribed roles. They argue that such
distinctions are best utilized by including both women and men at
all levels of ministry leadership.

### Roles in marriage

Christian Egalitarians believe that *full partnership* in an equal
marriage is the most biblical view. As persons, husband and wife
are of equal value. There is no priority of one spouse over the
other. In truth, they are one.^[[3]](#note-Staggs)^ Bible scholar
[Frank Stagg](Frank_Stagg "Frank Stagg") and Classicist
[Evelyn Stagg](Evelyn_Stagg "Evelyn Stagg") write that husband-wife
equality produces the most intimate, wholesome and mutually
fulfilling marriages. They conclude that the Apostle Paul's
statement sometimes called the "Magna Carta of
Humanity"^[[4]](#note-1)^ and recorded in Galatians 3:28 applies to
all Christian relationships, including Christian marriage: "There
is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is
*neither male nor female*: for you are all *one* in Christ
Jesus."^[[5]](#note-2)^

Christian egalitarian theologians also find it significant that the
"two becoming one" concept, first cited in Gen. 2:24, was quoted by
Jesus in his teachings on marriage (Matt. 19:4-6; Mark 10:7-9). In
those passages he reemphasized the concept by adding to the Genesis
passage these words: "So, they are no longer two, but one" (NIV).
The Apostle Paul cited the Genesis 2:24 passage in Eph.
5:30-32.^[[3]](#note-Staggs)^

### Roles in the Church

Egalitarians advocate *ability*-based, rather than *gender*-based,
ministry of Christians of all ages, ethnicities and socio-economic
classes.^[[6]](#note-3)^ Egalitarians support the ordination of
women, and are more conservative both theologically and morally
than Christian feminists.

David Scholer, prominent New Testament scholar at Fuller
Theological Seminary, affirms this view. He believes that Galatians
3:28 is “the fundamental Pauline theological basis for the
inclusion of women and men as equal and mutual partners in all of
the ministries of the church.”^[[7]](#note-4)^ Galatians 3:28
represents "the summation of Paul's theological vision," according
to Pamela Eisenbaum, professor at Iliff School of Theology, who is
one of four Jewish New Testament scholars teaching in Christian
theological schools.^[[8]](#note-5)^^[[9]](#note-6)^

### Opposing view

The opposing view is
[Complementarianism](Complementarianism "Complementarianism"), a
theological view held by some Christians that differing, often
non-overlapping roles between men and women are biblically
required─in marriage, church leadership, and elsewhere. The Roman
Catholic Church has formally opposed *radical egalitarianism* and
has stated that the differences between men and women are not
merely phenomenal, but are in fact ontological in
nature.^[[10]](#note-7)^

## Biblical foundations

Christian Egalitarians' interpretation of scriptures and spiritual
convictions bring them to the conclusion that the manner and
teaching of Jesus *abolished* discrimination against racial
minorities, slaves, and women, in both the church and marriage.
They believe that the Bible, properly interpreted, teaches the
fundamental equality of believers of all racial and ethnic groups
and all economic classes.^[[11]](#note-8)^ They consider
overarching principles of the [Bible](Bible "Bible") to be that men
and women are equally created in God's image; equally responsible
for sin; equally redeemed by Christ, and equally gifted by God's
Spirit for service; and equally held responsible for using their
God-given gifts.^[[12]](#note-9)^

A scripture passage they consider key to the advocacy of full
equality of responsibility and authority for both women and men is
contained in a Pauline polemic containing three antitheses:

> **There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.**
> {{\#if:Galatians 3:28|
> – Galatians 3:28{{\#if:|, *{{{3}}}*}}{{\#if:|, {{{4}}}}}
> 
> }}

Ultimately, Christian egalitarianism holds that all people are
equal in fundamental worth and moral status. A significant source
of this trend of thought is the Christian notion that humankind
were created in the living image of God *(Imago Dei)*. This
position has been articulated by several evangelical and reformed
leaders in statement entitled
"[Men, Women and Biblical Equality](index.php?title=Men,_Women_and_Biblical_Equality&action=edit&redlink=1 "Men, Women and Biblical Equality (page does not exist)")."^[[13]](#note-MenWomen)^
Their understanding of there being
*no biblical basis for gender-based roles or authority structure in marriage and in ministry*
is based on their interpretation of scriptures such as Gen 1:26-28,
2:18, 20, 2:21-23, 3:6, 5:1-2, 21:12; Matt 20:25-28, 23:8; Mark
10:42-45; John 1:12-13, 13:13-17; Acts 1:14, 2:1-21, 18:26, 21:9;
Rom 5:12-21, 8:14-17, 16:1-7, 12-13, 15; Phil 4:2-3; Col 4:15; 1
Cor 11:2-16, 12:7, 11, 14:31, 15:21-22; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 3:13,
26-28, 5:1, 13; 1 Peter 2:9-10, 4:10-11, 5:2-3, 14:33-36; 1 Tim
2:9-15; Rev 1:6, 5:10.

Jesus did not conform to a mentality unfavorable to women, but
reacted against inequalities based on sexual differences. By
calling women to follow him he showed that he went beyond the
customs and outlook of his environment.^[[3]](#note-Staggs)^
Illustrative of efforts to institutionalize this notion are these
excerpts from the organizational *Statement of Faith* of
[Christians for Biblical Equality](Christians_for_Biblical_Equality "Christians for Biblical Equality"),
a major Christian Egalitarian organization:

> -   We believe in the equality and essential dignity of men and
>     women of all ethnicities, ages, and classes. We recognize that all
>     persons are made in the image of God and are to reflect that image
>     in the community of believers, in the home, and in society.
> -   We believe that men and women are to diligently develop and use
>     their God-given gifts for the good of the home, church and
>     society.
>

> *{{{3}}}*}}{{\#if:|, {{{4}}}}}
> 
> }}

Egalitarians find support for their convictions throughout the
Bible with regard to the doctrine of grace. For instance, the
Psalms are seen as a good example of use of the concept of grace in
the Hebrew Bible. The psalmist, traditionally seen to be King
David, calls out to God to intercede in both his personal affairs
and with the concerns of the nation. Other Hebrew concepts used to
describe the grace of God include a group of words whose basic
element is *hen* or *hanam,* which means the spontaneous gift of
affection; and *raham*, which implies mercy and compassion,
including the merciful restoration of a broken relationship. In the
NT, most of Jesus' parables provide examples of grace in the sense
of undeserved or unmerited favor or reward. A prime example is the
parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32). Another is the Parable
of the Workers in the Vineyard (Matt. 20:15-16).

In both the Tanakh and
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), repeated reference
is made to the doctrine. Some scholars argue that the system of
laws used in Ancient Israel outlined a basis for human rights that
was egalitarian at its core: "Do not show partiality in judging;
hear both small and great alike…" (Deut. 1:17), discussing the
economy of grace by which God deals with his subjects. In the New
Testament, the Apostle Peter, in a post-resurrection appearance
says, "I now realize how true it is that God does not show
favoritism…" (Acts 10:34).

A straightforward reading of Matthew 20:25–26a, Mark 10:42, and
Luke 22:25 suggests that Jesus even *forbids* any hierarchy in
Christian relationships: "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles
*lord it over* them, and their high officials *exercise authority*
over them. Not so with you!" While "lord it over" implies abusive
leadership, his words "exercise authority" have no connotation of
abuse of authority.**^[[15]](#note-11)^**

-   Joel 2:28-29
-   Judges 4:4
-   Romans 16:7, TNIV

## Gender equality

Gender equality refers to the biblically-based belief that gender,
in and of itself, neither privileges nor curtails a believer’s
gifting or calling to any ministry in the church or home.
Egalitarianism affirms that God designed men and women to
complement and benefit one another. It does not imply that women
and men are identical or undifferentiated.^[[16]](#note-12)^

## Hermeneutic

Conservative theologian
[Roger Nicole](Roger_Nicole "Roger Nicole"), a Baptist considered
an expert in [Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") and regarded as one
of the preeminent theologians in America, is a
**Christian Egalitarian** and also a
[Biblical Inerrantist](index.php?title=Biblical_Inerrancy&action=edit&redlink=1 "Biblical Inerrancy (page does not exist)").
He recognizes that biblical egalitarianism is still viewed by many
as inconsistent with biblical inerrancy, although he disagrees. He
writes that "the matter of the place of women in the home, in
society, and in the church is not an issue that can be conclusively
determined by a few apparently restrictive passages that are often
advanced by those who think that subordination represents God’s
will for women."^[[17]](#note-Nicole)^

> I believe that most, if not all, of the restrictions on women in
> society have no basis in Scripture, and that those maintained in
> the Church are based on an inadequate interpretation of a few
> restrictive passages, which put them in contradiction with the
> manifest special concern and love of God for women articulated from
> Genesis to Revelation. {{\#if:Roger Nicole, 2006|
> – Roger Nicole, 2006{{\#if:|, *{{{3}}}*}}{{\#if:|, {{{4}}}}}

## History

Egalitarians believe that their roots go back to ancient Israel and
the earliest Christianity, pointing to biblical examples of women
leading God's people as prophets,^[[18]](#note-13)^
apostles,^[[19]](#note-14)^ deacons,^[[20]](#note-15)^ and house
church leaders.^[[21]](#note-16)^ They also cite extrabiblical
documents and inscriptions from ancient Israel and the early church
which named women as elders, priests, bishops, ministers,
deacons^[[22]](#note-17)^ and prophets.^[[23]](#note-18)^ They
argue that women were prominent as leaders in the early Christian
church while it was a private, underground movement heavily
dependent on house church hospitality, but when the church became a
public, visible religion in the third and fourth centuries, it
imposed on itself the gender roles favored by the predominant
society and women's access to leadership subsequently died
out.^[[24]](#note-Torj)^

While the whole of Christian history contains sporadic examples of
unusually prominent women in the church,^[[25]](#note-19)^ most
Christians did not begin to seriously consider the question of
equality or the ordination of women until the Society of Friends
(Quakers) in the early 1800s.^[[26]](#note-20)^ Arguably every
decade since the 1860s has seen a new denomination accept the
ordination of women as pastors and elders.^[[24]](#note-Torj)^

[Christians for Biblical Equality](Christians_for_Biblical_Equality "Christians for Biblical Equality")
(CBE) takes a generally conservative stance on social issues and a
firm stance *against* the ordination of homosexuals. It publishes
two quarterly periodicals, a magazine known as *Mutuality* and the
scholarly journal *Priscilla Papers*.

## Criticism

### From the distinction between roles and equality

Critics argue that egalitarians fail to draw a distinction between
*equality* and the *role* of individuals. For instance, men and
women are not unequal because they are called to different roles.
Women are not superior to men because they are called to the role
of bearing children. Likewise, men are not superior to women
because they are called to the role of church leadership.
Difference in roles does not imply difference in equality.

### From the Trinity

Some feel that one's position on egalitarianism affects one's
position on subordination within the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity").
In other words, [Jesus](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") is the eternal
Son and *always* does that which is pleasing to the
[Father](God_the_Father "God the Father") (John 8:29), yet his
(subordinate) role as the Son does not imply inequality. This
relationship of equality with different roles fits the
[Complementarian](Complementarianism "Complementarianism") view.
