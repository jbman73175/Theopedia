**Elder** is one of the principal terms in the New Testament for
the primary office of a church leader. Together with **overseer**
and **shepherd**, these terms describe the function and character
of the men God ordained to rule and govern the body of Christ in
the local congregation.

In some Christian traditions (e.g.,
[Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy"),
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church"),
[Anglicanism](Anglicanism "Anglicanism"),
[Methodism](Methodism "Methodism")) an *elder* is a clergy person
who usually serves a local church or churches and who has been
ordained to a ministry of Word,
[Sacrament](Sacraments "Sacraments"), and Order, filling the
preaching and pastoral offices. In other Christian traditions (e.g.
[Presbyterianism](Presbyterian "Presbyterian"),
[Baptists](Baptist "Baptist")), an *elder* may be a lay person
charged with serving as an administrator in a local church, or be
ordained to such an office.

## New Testament

### Terms

While there are three different words to offer perspective on who
the man is, what he does and how he does it, it is important to
note that the words are used synonymously and refer to the same
office and person. In I Timothy and Titus, Paul drafts nearly
identical lists of qualifications for elder and overseer, while
Peter draws all three concepts together in one passage: "Therefore,
I exhort the elders among you... shepherd the flock of God among
you, exercising oversight..." (I Peter 5:1-2). Luke uses the terms
elder, overseer and shepherd interchangeably in Acts 20.

#### *presbuteros*

*(Strong's number 4245)*

This is the most commonly used word in the New Testament with
regard to church leaders. It refers 28 times in the Gospels and
Acts to the members of the Jewish Sanhedrin and 12 times in
Revelation to the representatives of the redeemed people of God.
The remaining 19 times the word is employed in Acts and the
Epistles, it identifies a unique group of leaders in the church.

The term simply means advanced in age, but in the first century
context indicates a rank or office among Jews as members of the
ruling council, among Greeks as those who those who managed public
affairs and administered justice, and among Christians as those who
presided over the local assemblies. While no specific age is given,
this term emphasizes the character of the elder and implies
maturity, dignity, experience, and honor (Strauch, p. 125)

#### *episkopos*

*(Strong's number 1985)*

This is a common word for in the Greek culture for any official who
acted as a superintendent, manager, controller, curator, guardian
or ruler. It occurs only 5 times in the New Testament, once
referring to Christ (1 Peter 2:25) and the other 4 times to church
leaders.

This term emphasizes the function of an elder as exercising
authority and supervision "by divine placement, initiative and
design." (Strauch, p. 148).

#### *poimen*

*(Strong's number 4166)*

This word simply means shepherd. It is applied only once in the
noun form and 3 times in the verb form in the New Testament in the
context of church leaders.

This term emphasizes the heart attitude of an elder as one who
tends, feeds, guides, protects and cares for his flock (Strauch,
149).

### Mandate

The clear teaching of Scripture places elders at the center of the
church's work, bestowing a great amount of responsibility and
authority as the highest level of local church leadership. It can
be reasonably demonstrated that Scripture mandates church
government by a plurality of elders. Together, the New Testament
writers mention elders, overseers and shepherds in reference to
church leadership more than twenty-five times in the Gospels and
the Epistles. The basis, selection, office, character, functions,
attitude and qualifications of elders are clearly laid out and the
pattern established early and often so as to leave little room for
confusion. Strauch writes, "In fact, the New Testament offers more
instruction regarding elders than on any other important church
subjects such as the Lord's Supper, the Lord's Day, baptism or
spiritual gifts." (Strauch, 103).

For example, Acts 11:30; 15:2, 4, 6, 22-23; 16:4; and 21:18
demonstrate that elders had a significant role in the Jerusalem
church and the Jerusalem council. In reference to churches in
Antioch of Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe, Acts 14:23
demonstrates Paul's pattern of appointing elders as a key step in
organizing a new church. Paul spoke directly to the elders in Acts
20:17 and warned them in 20:28 to "[b]e on guard for [them]selves
and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made [them]
overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with
His own blood."

Each of these passages points to an early understanding that God's
intent for church leadership was by a plurality of elders.
Instruction about elders is given to the churches in I
Thessalonians 5:12-13; I Timothy 3:1-7, 10 and 5:17-22, 24-25;
Titus 1:5-9; Hebrews 13:17; James 5:14; and I Peter 5:5.
Instruction is given to elders about churches in I Thessalonians
5:13; James 5:14; and I Peter 5:1-5. In the majority of the
references the word for elders is plural and word for church is
singular, indicating a very clear directive that the church should
be governed by a plurality of elders.
