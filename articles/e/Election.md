In Christian theology, **election** refers to [God's](God "God")
choosing of individuals or peoples to be the objects of his
[grace](Grace "Grace") or to otherwise fulfill his purposes. Most
often God's election is associated with his choice of individuals
unto [salvation](Salvation "Salvation"). The Calvinist view of
election (also known as unconditional election) teaches that in
eternity God chose some individuals from the mass of fallen
humanity unto salvation without regard to any merit or foreseen
faith in them, but solely based on His sovereign intentions.

Election and [predestination](Predestination "Predestination") are
very similar concepts to the point that the terms can sometimes be
used interchangeably. However, there is a difference in the
emphasis of the two terms. Election primarily has in view God's
sovereign selection, whereas predestination accents the purpose or
goal of His election. Scripture clearly teaches both election and
predestination; however, there are a variety of views as to *who*,
*when*, *why*, and *how* God does so.

## Conditional election

[Jacobus Arminius](Jacobus_Arminius "Jacobus Arminius") disagreed
with the Calvinist understanding of election, as reflected in the
[Belgic Confession](Belgic_Confession "Belgic Confession"). Upon
his death, Arminius' followers drew up
[Five articles of Remonstrance](Five_articles_of_Remonstrance "Five articles of Remonstrance"),
a document opposing some of the prevailing Calvinist views in the
Dutch church.

Article I. That God, by an eternal, unchangeable purpose in Jesus
Christ, his Son, before the foundation of the world,
*hath determined, out of the fallen, sinful race of men, to save in Christ, for Christ's sake, and through Christ, those who, through the grace of the Holy Ghost, shall believe on this his Son Jesus, and shall persevere in this faith and obedience of faith, through this grace, even to the end*;
and, on the other hand, to leave the incorrigible and unbelieving
in sin and under wrath, and to condemn them as alienate from
Christ, according to the word of the Gospel in John iii. 36: "He
that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that
believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God
abideth on him," and according to other passages of Scripture also.
Article IV. That this grace of God is the beginning, continuance,
and accomplishment of an good, even to this extent, that the
regenerate man himself,
*without that prevenient or assisting; awakening, following, and co-operative grace, elm neither think, will, nor do good*,
nor withstand any temptations to evil; so that
*all good deeds or movements that can be conceived must be ascribed to the grace of God in Christ*.
But, as respects the mode of the operation of this grace,
*it is not irresistible*, inasmuch as it is written concerning many
that they have resisted the Holy Ghost, -Acts vii., and elsewhere
in many places.
Thus in this view, God's choice of individuals for salvation is not
unconditional. It is conditioned upon God's foreknowledge of
(enduring) faith in individuals which is made possible because of
God's [prevenient grace](Prevenient_grace "Prevenient grace"). That
is, God's prevenient grace enables mankind to make the choice to
believe, obey and persevere in faith, but they can resist this
grace and choose to be lost. Those that God foresees will believe,
obey and endure to the end (as enabled by His grace), are the ones
whom He chooses from the beginning for salvation. The choice to be
chosen is ultimately based on the individual, not on God, whom they
insist wants all to be saved.

Arminians use primarily Rom 8:29 ("those whom He *foreknew*, He
also predestined") and 1 Pet 1:1-2 ("chosen according to the
*foreknowledge* of God") to argue that foreknowledge of faith is
the basis of election. They also argue from deductive logic based
on God's character, and the necessity of free will for man to be
morally responsible.

## Corporate election

An alternative understanding of Election found in Arminianism
^[[1]](#note-0)^ is that Christ is primarily God's elect, and that
through Christ's redemptive work God has purposed to form a people
to be His body (who become part of the Elect/ Christ). This
election is freely offered to all. Anyone who wants to be
identified with Christ, becomes part of the elect, and is assured
of salvation. But at the same time they can lose that salvation if
they cease to be identified with Christ.

An analogy used is that, Christ is the captain of a ship called
"elect" (which is the Church), this ship is on a secure journey
towards salvation. It is the individual's choice whether he wants
to be on this ship or not. If the individual does, he is part of
the elect and his salvation is secure, but if he chooses to bail
out, then he's no longer part of the elect and he's lost.

Thus in biblical passages mentioning/alluding to God's election,
the elect refers to *an undefined group* of elect people in Christ,
*not specifically chosen individuals*. For example,

1.  "You did not choose Me but *I chose you (plural)*..." (John
    15:16a NASB) - The Church did not choose Christ but Christ the
    Church
2.  "What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but
    *those who were chosen obtained it*, and the rest were hardened;"
    (Rom 11:7 NASB) - believing Jews obtained it, the rest were
    hardened
3.  For God *has not destined us* for wrath,
    *but for obtaining salvation* through our Lord Jesus Christ" (Thess
    5:9 NASB)- God did not destine the Church for wrath but for
    salvation
4.  etc...

### Calvinist argument

Regarding this view, [John Piper](John_Piper "John Piper") (a
Calvinist theologian) says,

width="20" valign="top"
style="color:\#B2B7F2;font-size:{{\#switch:20px
10px=20px
30px=60px
40px=80px
50px=100px
60px=120px
“
First notice what the point of God's choosing is in 1 Corinthians
1:27-30.
27 God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, God
chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong, 28 God chose
what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to
bring to nothing things that are, 29 so that no human being might
boast in the presence of God.
What this text says very clearly is that God chose particular kinds
of people to be in the church. He did not just choose the church
and leave its composition to man. He chose foolish individuals and
called them into Christ. He chose some weak individuals and called
them into Christ. He chose some low and despised individuals and
called them into Christ. So that no one might boast in anyone but
the Lord.

And then to make this crystal clear he said in verse 30
(literally): "From him [God] you are in Christ Jesus." Or as the
NASB says, "By his doing you are in Christ Jesus." Or the NIV: "It
is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus." In other words, it
is just as though Paul knew that someone would come along some day
and say that God does not choose who is in Christ, but only chooses
Christ and any who put themselves in Christ. So he says, in verses
27-29, that God chose the individuals who would make up the church
in Christ. And he says in verse 30 that it is by God's doing that
they are put in Christ. ^[[2]](#note-1)^

If individuals are not involved in God's election but only the
Church viewed as a corporate whole, we are at a loss to know how it
is possible for God to elect the Church without in any way being
responsible for the election of any individual saint who forms a
part of it. Christ, on the other hand, states that as the Good
Shepherd He calleth His own sheep by name and leadth them out; and
as the Door, pictures His own sheep entering one by one ('if any
man') through faith in Him unto salvation (John 10:3,7,9).

Paul, in Romans 9, sets out to prove that God’s
salvation-righteousness was never conditioned upon birth or family
privilege, neither upon personal merit or good works (the corporate
election argument of the Jew, with his faith in the law). No,
salvation has been always on the basis of divine individual
election. It is God alone Who, on the ground of His sovereign grace
and mercy, unconditionally chooses whom He will for salvation and
blessing. Thus, He had opened the flood-gates of salvation now to
Gentiles.
Paul then gives sound scriptural examples that God had always acted
in this way, even from within the privileged elect nation of
Israel. He cites three incontrovertible examples of individual and
unconditional election: Isaac and not Ishmael (Romans 9:6-9); Jacob
and not Esau (Romans 9:10-13); and Moses, not Pharaoh (Romans
9:14-18). In Romans 9 we are on the ground of individual election
to salvation.

## John Calvin

For [John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") (1509-1564), the
doctrine of "eternal election" refers to both the predestination of
the elect and the reprobate ^[[4]](#note-3)^.

> By predestination we mean the eternal decree of God, by which
> *he determined with himself whatever he wished to happen with regard to every man*.
> All are not created on equal terms, but some are preordained to
> eternal life, others to eternal damnation; and, accordingly, as
> each has been created for one or other of these ends, we say that
> he has been predestinated to life or to death...
> 
> {{\#if:John Calvin|
> —John Calvin{{\#if:Institutes, book 3, ch.21,
> sec.5|*Institutes, book 3, ch.21, sec.5*}}
> }}

The ultimate cause of both election and reprobation is the secret
council of God, and not any cause in the individuals (whether good
or bad).

> They [those who object to "eternal election"] add also, that it is
> not without cause the vessels of wrath are said to be fitted for
> destruction, and that God is said to have prepared the vessels of
> mercy, because in this way the praise of salvation is claimed for
> God, whereas the blame of perdition is thrown upon those who of
> their own accord bring it upon themselves. But were I to concede
> that by the different forms of expression Paul softens the
> harshness of the former clause, it
> *by no means follows, that he transfers the preparation for destruction to any other cause than the secret counsel of God*.
> This, indeed, is asserted in the preceding context, where God is
> said to have raised up Pharaoh, and to harden whom he will. Hence
> it follows, that
> *the hidden counsel of God is the cause of hardening*.
> 
> {{\#if:John Calvin|
> —John Calvin{{\#if:Institutes, book 3, ch.23, sec.1 (Comments in

> inserted)|*Institutes, book 3, ch.23, sec.1 (Comments in brackets inserted)*}}
> }}

The elect are saved based on God's free mercy, while the reprobate
are excluded from it by God's righteous and "incomprehensible"
judgement.

> ...We maintain that this counsel, as regards the elect, is
> *founded on his free mercy, without any respect to human worth*,
> while those whom he dooms to destruction are excluded from access
> to life by a
> *just and blameless, but at the same time incomprehensible judgment*...
> 
> {{\#if:John Calvin|
> —John Calvin{{\#if:Institutes, book 3,
> ch.21,sec.7|*Institutes, book 3, ch.21,sec.7*}}
> }}

All elect individuals, including those from the O.T. belong to One
seed (Jesus Christ), and are ultimately connected to God the Father
(not [Abraham](Abraham "Abraham")).

> These [elect individuals] are considered as belonging to that one
> seed of which Paul makes mention, (Rom 9: 8; Gal 3: 16, &c). For
> although adoption was deposited in the hand of Abraham, yet as many
> of his posterity were cut off as rotten members, in order that
> election may stand and be effectual, it is necessary to ascend to
> the head in whom the heavenly Father has connected his elect with
> each other, and bound them to himself by an indissoluble tie.
> 
> {{\#if:John Calvin|
> —John Calvin{{\#if:Institutes, book 3, ch.21,sec.7 (Comments in

> }}

The evidences of election (today) are calling and justification,
while the marks of reprobation are either a lack of knowledge of
Jesus Christ or a lack of sanctification.

> In regard to the elect, we regard *calling* as the evidence of
> election, and *justification* as another symbol of its
> manifestation, until it is fully accomplished by the attainment of
> glory. But as the Lord seals his elect by calling and
> justification, so by excluding the reprobate either from the
> *knowledge of his name* or the *sanctification of his Spirit*, he
> by these marks in a manner discloses the judgment which awaits
> them.

## Westminster Confession of Faith

I. God from all eternity, did, by the most wise and holy counsel of
His own will, freely, and
*unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass*;[Eph 1:11, Rom 9:15,
18; 11:33; Heb 6:17] yet so, as thereby neither is God the author
of sin,[Jas 1:13, 17; 1 John 1:5] nor is violence offered to the
will of the creatures; nor is the liberty or contingency of second
causes taken away, but rather established. [Acts 2:23; 4:27, 28;
Matt 17:12; John 19:11, Prov 16:33]
V. Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God, before
the foundation of the world was laid, according to His eternal and
immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of His
will, has chosen, in Christ, unto everlasting glory,[Eph 1:4,9,11;
Rom 8:30; 2 Tim 1:9; 1 Thess 5:9] out of His mere free grace and
love,
*without any foresight of faith, or good works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature*,
as conditions, or causes moving Him thereunto;[Rom 9:11, 13, 16;
Eph 1:4, 9] and all to the praise of His glorious grace. [Eph 1:6,
12] (italics added)
VI. As God has appointed the elect unto glory, so has He, by the
eternal and most free purpose of His will,
*foreordained all the means thereunto*.[1 Pet 1:2; Eph 1:4, 5;
2:10; 2 Thess 2:13] Wherefore, they who are elected, being fallen
in Adam, are redeemed by Christ,[1 Thess 5:9, Tit 2:14] are
effectually called unto faith in Christ by His Spirit working in
due season, are justified, adopted, sanctified,[Rom 8:30; Eph 1:5;
2 Thess 2:13] and kept by His power, through faith, unto
salvation.[1 Pet 1:5] Neither are any other redeemed by Christ,
effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but
the elect only.[John 6:64-65; 8:47; 10:26; 17:9; Rom 8:28; 1 John
2:19]
Thus, God's election is unchangable, it permanently ordains what
will happen, but at the same time in a way that does not hinder the
individuals' free will or choice, rather it establishes it
(election ensures that the choice/possibility is real). It is not
based on anything in the individual; neither good motives or good
actions, since both are evil continually (in this way it is
unconditional). And that there are means God has ordained, by which
the elect must be saved. They must be called, justified,
sanctified, persevere in faith, etc. to be saved, and they all will
be saved and no one else.

[Westminster Confession of Faith](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_III.html),
chapter III "Of God's Eternal Decree".

    "eternal election."
