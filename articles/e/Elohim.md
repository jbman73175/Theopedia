“The word **Elohim** is the plural of *El* (or possibly *Eloah*)
and is the first name of God given in the Old Testament: “In the
beginning, God (*Elohim*) created the heavens and the earth, (Gen.
1:1).

“The name *Elohim* is unique to Hebraic thinking – it occurs only
in Hebrew and in no other ancient Semitic language. The masculine
plural ending does not mean “gods” when referring to the true God
of Israel, since the name is mainly used with singular verb forms
and with adjectives and pronouns in the singular (e.g. see Gen.
1:26).”

## Etymology

The etymology of the word *Elohim* is prehistoric, and therefore
unknown. There are many theories, however, including the
following:

-   Some trace its origin in *el* or *ul* which may mean ("to be
    strong") or possibly ("to be in front"), from which also are
    derived *ayil* ("ram", the one in front of the flock) and *elah*
    (the prominent "terebinth"); *Elohim* would then be an expanded
    plural form of *El*. (However, Semitic etymologies are actually
    generally based on triconsonantal roots, which this proposal
    completely ignores.)
-   Some see Elohim as a plural of Eloah. While the words *El*,
    *Elohim*, and *Eloah* are clearly related, with the word *El* being
    the stem, it is uncertain whether the word *Elohim* is derived
    directly from *El* or from *Eloah*. The word Eloah is a singular
    (or dual) form of Elohim and appears more than seventy times in the
    Old Testament, primarily in poetic passages where Elohim is
    generally used in narrative passages.

-   Others relate both *Elohim* and *Eloah* ("a god") to *alah*
    ("to terrify") or *alih* ("to be perplexed, afraid; to seek refuge
    because of fear"). *Eloah* and *Elohim*, therefore, would be "He
    who is the object of fear or reverence," or "He with whom one who
    is afraid takes refuge".

-   Biblical scholars tend to resist making connections with the
    father god of Ugarit, *El*, due to the uncertainty of religious
    links between Canaanite and Israelite religion. Instead they focus
    on the common Semitic linguistic background of these two cultures.

The form of the word *Elohim*, with the ending *-im*, is plural and
masculine, but the construction is usually singular, i.e. it
governs a singular verb or adjective when referring to the Hebrew
god, but reverts to its normal plural when used of heathen
divinities (Psalms 96:5; 97:7). There are many theories as to why
the word is plural:

-   In one view, predominant among
    [monotheists](Monotheism "Monotheism"), the word is plural in order
    to augment its meaning to form either a plural of majesty or an
    abstraction meaning "Divine majesty".

-   Among Trinitarian Christian writers it is seen as evidence for
    the doctrine of the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"), a plurality in
    the Godhead.

-   In a view common among both secular scholars and polytheists,
    the word's plurality is seen as reflective of an early Judaic
    polytheism. Originally meaning "the gods", or the "sons of El," the
    supreme being, the word may have been singularized by later
    monotheist priests who sought to replace worship of the many gods
    with their own patron god [YHWH](Yahweh "Yahweh") alone.

## Significance in the documentary hypothesis

The choice of the word for God varies in the Hebrew Bible. Some
scholars view these variations as evidence of different source
texts, the "documentary hypothesis." According to the proponents of
this theory, *Elohim* is consistently used in texts that reflect
the early northern traditions of the Kingdom of Israel, whereas
[Yahweh](Yahweh "Yahweh") (*Jehovah*) is consistently used in texts
that derive from the early southern traditions of the Kingdom of
Judah and Jerusalem. Hence,
[higher criticism](Biblical_criticism "Biblical criticism") has
found it useful to distinguish between "E" traditions and "J"
traditions, which they see as reflective of multiple sources and
multiple authors for Genesis. See also the
[JEDP theory](JEDP_theory "JEDP theory") for extension of the
documentary hypothesis to the idea of multiple sources and
authorship for the entire Pentateuch.
