**Emanuel Swedenborg** (1688-1772) was a prolific eighteenth
century inventor, scientist, philosopher and mystic, theological
speculator, and forerunner to modern spiritualism. Swedenborg was
born in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of a clergyman and professor of
theology, Jesper Swedberg.

"After studies at the University of Uppsala, where he concentrated
on mathematics and astronomy, Swedenborg traveled for 5 years
throughout Europe (1710-1714). After a 2-year period in which he
engaged in scientific journalism, Swedenborg became assessor at the
Royal College of Mines in 1716. For the next 30 years, Swedenborg's
main work was concentrated in the Swedish metal-mining industry.
His engineering skill earned him a wide reputation. From 1747
onward, he devoted most of his time to the acquisition of knowledge
through traveling and observation and to the elaboration and
publication of scientific and theological
theories."^[[1]](#note-0)^

In 1745, Emanuel Swedenborg had a life changing experience - the
Lord appeared to him and told him that a person was needed to serve
as the means by which God would further reveal Himself to humanity,
in a similar manner to the prophets in the Holy Bible. This vision
began Swedenborg's life as a spiritual revelator for the expressed
purpose of writing doctrines that would belong to the New
Jerusalem, or the New Christian Church mentioned in the Book of
Revelation." ^[[2]](#note-1)^

  
"Although not a theologian in the strict sense, he was an
outstanding philosopher or theological speculator. He rejected the
traditional Christian teaching of the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity")
. . . Swedenborg's theory of redemption rejected any notion that
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") was in himself a divine
person, but it held that the inmost soul of Jesus was divine. This
divine soul had taken on a human form from Mary, and Jesus' human
nature had been glorified by his exemplary life. By resisting all
the temptations and ills of the powers of darkness, Jesus had
opened a way for divine life to flow into all mankind. Man had
become free to know truth and to be able to obey its dictates.
Human [salvation](Salvation "Salvation") lay in this knowledge and
obedience."^[[3]](#note-2)^
