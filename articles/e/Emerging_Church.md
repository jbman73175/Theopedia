The **Emerging church** movement (or the **Emergent church**
movement) is described by its own proponents as "a growing
generative friendship among missional Christian leaders seeking to
love our world in the Spirit of Jesus Christ."
^[[1]](#note-evabout)^ Instead of calling it a *movement*, those of
the Emergent sentiment would rather call it a "conversation." The
leading voice for the emerging church movement is the
[Emergent Village](http://www.emergentvillage.com/), which began as
a group of young Christian leaders gathered under the auspices of
[Leadership Network](http://leadnet.org/) in the late 1990s and
organized in 2001. In their own words, they began meeting because
many were "disillusioned and disenfranchised by the conventional
ecclesial institutions of the late 20th century."
^[[1]](#note-evabout)^

A group of Emergent leaders states it this way: "We each find great
joy and promise in dialogue and conversation... Throughout the
history of the church, followers of Jesus have come to know what
they believe and how they believe it by being open to the honest
critique and varied perspectives of others. We are radically open
to the possibility that our
[hermeneutic](Hermeneutic "Hermeneutic") stance will be greatly
enriched in conversation with others. In other words, we value
dialogue very highly, and we are convinced that open and generous
dialogue rather than chilling criticism and censorship offers the
greatest hope for the future of the church in the world."

## Critical overview

According to [D.A. Carson](D.A._Carson "D.A. Carson"), the emerging
church movement "arose as a protest against the institutional
church, modernism and
[seeker-sensitive](Seeker-sensitive "Seeker-sensitive") churches...
It has encouraged evangelicals to take note of cultural trends and
has emphasized authenticity among believers."
^[[3]](#note-christianexaminer-ecmthreat)^ At its heart "lies the
conviction that changes in the culture signal that a new church is
emerging. Christian leaders must therefore adapt to this emerging
church. Those who fail to do so are blind to the cultural
accretions that hide the gospel behind forms of thought and modes
of expression that no longer communicate with the new generation,
the emerging generation."^[[4]](#note-enjoyinggod-emergent)^

Sam Storms notes that it is a protest against the "failure of
[evangelicals] to recognize the demise and passing of so-called
'[Modernism](Modernism "Modernism")' and the ascendancy of
[Postmodernism](Postmodernism "Postmodernism") and the countless
ways it affects both the larger culture and how we live as
Christians and pursue ministry as the Church... It has an emphasis
on narrative rather than propositions ('tell me your story, don't
explain principles')." Quoting D.A. Carson, Storms explains that
there is an emphasis "on affections and feelings over against
rational, linear thought; on experience over truth; on inclusion
rather than exclusion; on the corporate over the individualistic,
etc. Tolerance is the principal virtue, as nothing is more
indicative of the mentality of modernism than telling someone they
are wrong (either intellectually, doctrinally, or
morally)."^[[4]](#note-enjoyinggod-emergent)^

Given the diversity of the movement, "penetrating criticisms that
apply to one part of it are sometimes inappropriate to some other
part," ^[[5]](#note-0)^. In other words, the Emerging Church (EC)
is difficult to pin down. Carson, while writing his book, wrote
that he had "not found it easy to portray it fairly,"
^[[6]](#note-1)^. [Mark Dever](Mark_Dever "Mark Dever") notes that,
"By its very nature it doesn't appreciate definition."
^[[7]](#note-2)^

## Distinctive beliefs

### Postmodernism over modernism

According to [Brian McLaren](Brian_McLaren "Brian McLaren"), the EC
is "a group of people who are talking about the gospel and church
and mission, especially in terms of changes going on in our culture
that some people call a shift from modern to postmodern
culture."^[[3]](#note-christianexaminer-ecmthreat)^

[D. A. Carson](D._A._Carson "D. A. Carson") adds to this by
stating, "Modernism is often pictured as pursuing truth,
absolutism, linear thinking, rationalism, certainty, the cerebral
as opposed to the affective which in turn breeds arrogance,
inflexibility, a lust to be right, the desire to control.
Postmodernism, by contrast, recognizes how much of what we know is
shaped by the culture in which we live, is controlled by emotions
and aesthetics and heritage, and in fact can only be intelligently
held as part of a common tradition, without overbearing claims to
be true or right. Modernism tries to find unquestioned foundations
on which to build the edifice of knowledge and then proceeds with
methodological rigor; postmodernism denies that such foundations
exist (it is antifoundational) and insists that we come to know
things in many ways, not a few of them lacking in rigor. Modernism
is hard-edged and, in the domain of religion, focuses on truth
versus error, right belief, confessionalism; postmodernism is
gentle and, in the domain of religion, focuses on relationships,
love, shared tradition, integrity in discussion"^[[8]](#note-3)^ He
goes on to add that "the majority of church leaders see a very
clear contrast between modern culture and postmodern culture and
connect the divide to questions of [how we know
things]."^[[9]](#note-4)^

*See main articles: [Postmodernism](Postmodernism "Postmodernism") and [Modernism](Modernism "Modernism").*
### Narrative over propositional truth

Brian McLaren believes that "Christians should present Christianity
through loving attitudes rather than logical arguments."
Furthermore, "[t]he gospel is made credible not by how we argue and
make truth claims. But it's made credible by the love and the good
deeds that flow from our lives and our
community."^[[3]](#note-christianexaminer-ecmthreat)^ McLaren's
statements overlap with the prevous section in that proponents of
the EC tend to reject a Christian faith that is made up of "logical
arguments" and propositional "truth claims." Instead, those in the
EC want to belittle the idea of arguing for the truth and logical
consistency of the Christian faith, and simply *live* the Christian
faith. Thus, what develops is a faith that is only lived while
little attention is given to what one actually believes. Biblical
Christianity denies (nor belittles) neither, and encompasses the
reality of living out that which one believes is true.

Adam Bradley writes that "PoMo (Postmodern) churches tend to shun
reductionist approaches to Scripture in which a story is reduced to
doctrines and principles but stripped of its tension and human
drama."^[[10]](#note-zeal-emergent)^ A "reductionist approach"
would be where a Pastor looks at a passage and draws out, for
example, that Jesus is indeed God from John 1:1. Those in the EC
desire, instead, to focus on a practical approach to Scripture
rather than one that draws out propositions.

It should be stated that proponents of the EC do not reject
propositional truth altogether, yet it remains near the bottom of
the priority list when EC Pastors preach or when the gospel is
shared with an unbeliever.

### Contemplation and reverence

In Dan Kimball's book, *The Emerging Church*, he advocates
"...contemplation and reverence instead of blaring music and
high-tech smoke and show in order to attract young, postmodern
Americans to the Church." ^[[11]](#note-5)^

*This is a **[section stub](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theopedia_sectionstubs "Category:Theopedia sectionstubs")**. Please edit it to add information.*
## Criticisms

### Relativism

[Albert Mohler](Albert_Mohler "Albert Mohler"), President of
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, describes Brian McLaren's
book *A Generous Orthodoxy* (2004) as follows: "Embracing the
worldview of the postmodern age, [Brian McLaren] embraces
[relativism](Relativism "Relativism") at the cost of clarity in
matters of truth and intends to redefine Christianity for this new
age... As a postmodernist, he considers himself free from any
concern for propositional truthfulness, and simply wants the
Christian community to embrace a pluriform understanding of truth
as a way out of doctrinal conflict and impasse."^[[12]](#note-6)^
Elsewhere, Mohler believes that the Emerging movement is "unwilling
to affirm that the Bible contains propositional truths that form
the framework for Christian belief, [instead] this movement argues
that we can have Christian symbolism and substance without those
thorny questions of truthfulness that have so vexed the modern
mind."^[[3]](#note-christianexaminer-ecmthreat)^

Sam Storms believes that in this movement "they long for... 'a
kinder, gentler' version of evangelicalism that is devoid of the
doctrinal dogmatism, moral certainty, and absolutist mindset that
they are convinced is out of touch with so-called postmodern
developments in our culture."^[[4]](#note-enjoyinggod-emergent)^

Although those in the Emerging church have denied belief in
relativism, they admit denying the
[correspondence theory of truth](index.php?title=Correspondence_theory_of_truth&action=edit&redlink=1 "Correspondence theory of truth (page does not exist)")
and agree with Leslie Newbigin that "the popular dichotomy between
'facts' (as what we know) and 'beliefs' (of which we can only say,
'this is true for me') rests on an illusion. ^[[13]](#note-7)^

### Reductionistic and critical understanding of modernism

According to [D.A. Carson](D.A._Carson "D.A. Carson"), Emerging
Church leaders are "painfully reductionistic about modernism and
the confessional Christianity that forged its way through the
modernist period".^[[3]](#note-christianexaminer-ecmthreat)^ In
brief, Modernism focused on the ability to know truths absolutely,
or in an objective way. Throughout the Postmodern movement, it has
been emphasized that each person is affected by their culture or
society in such a way that each person cannot be objective about
truth. Thus, most EC leaders tend to shun Modernism and believe
that all methods and ideas that were developed or during this time
(e.g. emphasis on expositonal preaching, apologetics,
[exclusivism](Exclusivism "Exclusivism")) are not helpful and are
in fact harmful in today's church.

Carson replies to this notion and notes that, "They could humbly
offer critiques of modernist confessionalism at its best and
gratefully acknowledge that many of us are Christians today because
our forbears, sustained by grace, were faithful to the gospel"
^[[14]](#note-8)^. It seems that most EC leaders are quick to judge
the Christianity of Modernism, yet were they not addressing their
culture in the best way they knew? Were they not faithful to the
gospel message? Are not EC leaders addressing *their* culture in
new ways? Similar questions are asked by Carson, and he concludes
that the unfair and uncalled-for criticism of the Christianity of
Modernism must stop ^[[15]](#note-9)^.

### Non-authoritative stance on gospel truths

"Many thinkers in the movement shy away from asserting that
Christianity is true and
authoritative."^[[3]](#note-christianexaminer-ecmthreat)^
To this, some emergent leaders have responded:

"We affirm the historic Trinitarian Christian faith and the ancient
creeds, and seek to learn from all of church history and we honor
the church's great teachers and leaders from East and West, North
and South; yes, we believe that Jesus is the crucified and risen
Savior of the cosmos and no one comes to the Father except through
Jesus. . . But we also acknowledge that we each find great joy and
promise in dialogue and conversation, even about [these]
items."^[[2]](#note-offresponse)^
However, others are not convinced of the sufficiency of the
affirmations:

"When it comes to issues such as the exclusivity of the gospel, the
identity of Jesus Christ as both fully human and fully divine, the
authoritative character of Scripture as written revelation, and the
clear teaching of Scripture concerning issues such as
homosexuality, this movement simply refuses to answer the
questions."^[[3]](#note-christianexaminer-ecmthreat)^
### Exaltation of community

"Community is good. But the community itself must never become more
important than conforming that community and its members to the
image of Christ and obedience to God the Father by the transforming
power of the Holy Spirit."^[[10]](#note-zeal-emergent)^
