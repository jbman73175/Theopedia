Emil Brunner
**Emil Brunner** (1889-1966) was a highly influential Swiss
theologian who, along with [Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth"),
is associated with [Neo-Orthodoxy](Neo-Orthodoxy "Neo-Orthodoxy")
or the dialectical theology movement. Ordained in the Swiss
Reformed Church, Brunner served as a pastor at Obstalden,
Switzerland, from 1916 to 1924. In 1924 he became professor of
systematic and practical theology at the University of Zürich,
where he taught continuously, except for extensive lecture tours in
the United States and in Asia.

"Like [Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth") he challenged the
leaders of modern rational and [liberal](Liberalism "Liberalism")
Christian theology and proclaimed a theology of revelation. The
Christian faith, he maintained, arises from the encounter between
individuals and God as He is revealed in the Bible. Brunner, in
attempting later to leave a place for
[natural theology](Natural_theology "Natural theology") in his
system, came into conflict with Barth over the question of natural
revelation. Brunner refused to accept the radical divorce between
grace and human consciousness that Barth
proposed."^[[1]](#note-0)^
