[John Stott](John_Stott "John Stott") notes that,

"I learned to my astonishment that God, whose 'impassibility' I
thought meant that he was incapable of emotion, speaks (though in
human terms) of his burning anger and vulnerable love. I discovered
too that Jesus of Nazareth, the perfect human being, was no
tight-lipped, unemotional ascetic. On the contrary, I read that he
turned on hypocrites with anger, looked on a rich young ruler and
loved him, could both rejoice in spirit and sweat drops of blood in
spiritual agony, was constantly moved with compassion, and even
burst into tears twice in public. From all this evidence it is
plain that our emotions are not to be suppressed, since they have
an essential place in our humanness and therefore in our Christian
discipleship."
