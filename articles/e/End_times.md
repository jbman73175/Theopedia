**End times** is a popular term used when referring to various
interpretations of the
[Book of Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation") and
other [prophetic](Prophecy "Prophecy") parts of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"), such as the
[Book of Daniel](Book_of_Daniel "Book of Daniel") and various
sayings of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") in the
[Gospels](New_Testament#The_Gospels "New Testament") concerning the
timing of Christ's [Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming")
and the establishment of his kingdom. There are various views
concerning the order of events leading up to and following the
return of Jesus and the significance of these events.

The "end times" is thought to be the time leading up to the return
of Christ. The end times will include the "birth pains" Jesus
referred to in the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24:1 - 25:46) and,
many believe, the seals, trumpets and bowls of the book of
Revelation. Some believe that the end times will be a separate and
shorter time than the "[last days](Last_days "Last days")" which
include the time from Christ's First Advent to the end of the 1,000
year reign of Christ on earth. However, the historical view, argued
by many scholars today such as
[Greg Beale](Greg_Beale "Greg Beale") and
[D. A. Carson](D._A._Carson "D. A. Carson"), is that that the end
times were inaugurated at the death and
[resurrection of Jesus](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus"),
yet the complete fulfillment of the end times remains future, with
a tension between that which has *already* and *not yet* come to
pass.

The study of "end times", known as **eschatology** (from the Greek
*eskhatos* meaning **last things**), is a subject that includes
such topics as death and the afterlife, the
[Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming") of Christ, the
[Millennial Kingdom](Millennial_Kingdom "Millennial Kingdom"), the
end of the world, resurrection of the dead,
[Heaven](Heaven "Heaven") and [Hell](Hell "Hell"), and new
creation.
