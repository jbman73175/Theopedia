**English Revised Version** (1881-1894) was a British revision of
the [King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version")
(KJV) of 1611. The [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament")
was published in 1881, the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") in 1885, and the
[Apocrypha](Apocrypha "Apocrypha") in 1894.

The New Testament version is commonly called the "Revised Version"
(RV) or the "English Revised Version" (ERV) of 1881. This was a
revision of the KJV made on the basis of the [Greek](Greek "Greek")
texts of Westcott and Hort (1881) and Tregelles (1857) --
representing a departure from the
[Textus Receptus](Textus_Receptus "Textus Receptus"). The readings
adopted by the committee of revisers were presented in a continuous
Greek text in Palmer in 1881 which includes marginal notes showing
every departure from the Greek text presumed to underlie the KJV
(cf. Scrivener 1881).

This English Revised Version was the basis for the later
[American Standard Version](American_Standard_Version "American Standard Version")
(1901).
