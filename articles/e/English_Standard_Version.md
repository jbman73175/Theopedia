## History

Work on this translation began with discontent (largely amongst
[Evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") Christians) over the
perceived looseness of style and content of recently-published
English
[Bible translations](Bible_translation "Bible translation"), as
well as the apparent trend toward gender-neutral language in
translations such as the [TNIV](TNIV "TNIV") and the
[New Revised Standard Version](New_Revised_Standard_Version "New Revised Standard Version"),
among others.

In 1997, Dr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family called together a
meeting of individuals concerned with these issues, and from it
came the
["Colorado Springs Guidelines"](http://www.bible-researcher.com/csguidelines.html):
a set of translation principles that ruled out the use of
genderâ€“neutral language. After this, permission was sought, and
granted, from the National Council of Churches to use the 1971
revision of the
[RSV](Revised_Standard_Version "Revised Standard Version") as the
English textual basis for the ESV.

## Translation philosophy

In their own words, the translators of the ESV sought to follow an
"essentially literal" translation philosophy. To that end, they
sought as far as possible to capture the precise wording of the
original text and the personal style of each Bible writer, while
taking into account differences of grammar, syntax, and idiom
between current literary English and the original languages. The
result is a translation that is more literal than the popular
[New International Version](New_International_Version "New International Version"),
but more idiomatic than the
[New American Standard Bible](New_American_Standard_Bible "New American Standard Bible")
(which is commonly known as the most literal of the modern
translations).

## Textual basis

First and foremost, the ESV is an update of the
[Revised Standard Version](Revised_Standard_Version "Revised Standard Version")
(RSV) of 1971 that aims to replace the non-Christian
interpretations in the RSV, improve the accuracy throughout with
more literal renderings, and somewhat update the language.

When necessary to translate difficult passages, the translators
referred to the
[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia](Masoretic_text "Masoretic text"),
2nd edition, to the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament,
4th corrected edition, and to the
[Nestle-Aland](Nestle-Aland "Nestle-Aland")
*Novum Testamentum Graece*, 27th edition. In a few exceptionally
difficult cases, the
[Dead Sea Scrolls](Dead_Sea_Scrolls "Dead Sea Scrolls"), the
[Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint"), the
[Samaritan Pentateuch](index.php?title=Samaritan_Pentateuch&action=edit&redlink=1 "Samaritan Pentateuch (page does not exist)"),
the
[Syriac](index.php?title=Syriac_language&action=edit&redlink=1 "Syriac language (page does not exist)")
[Peshitta](Peshitta "Peshitta"), the
[Latin Vulgate](Vulgate "Vulgate"), and other sources were
consulted to shed possible light on the text, or, if necessary, to
support a divergence from the Masoretic text.

## Impact and growth

Since its release in 2001, the ESV has been well-received by both
individual Christians and churches in the English-speaking world,
especially in conservative
[Reformed](Reformed_churches "Reformed churches") and
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") circles.

In February 2005, the first study Bible using the ESV text was
released. The *Reformation Study Bible* was published by
[Ligonier Ministries](http://www.ligonier.org/) with
[R. C. Sproul](R._C._Sproul "R. C. Sproul"), a prominent Reformed
theologian, author, and pastor, as its General Editor.

In October 2008, Crossway Books released "The ESV Study Bible," a
completely new work. Within the first three months of publication
the book sold out of its original run and had to undergo an
additional printing.
