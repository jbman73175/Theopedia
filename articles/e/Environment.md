The historic Christian attitude towards **the environment** has
made heavy use of the concept of "[dominion](Dominion "Dominion")",
stemming from Gen. 1:28. Some Christians thus describe creation in
terms which suggest that it exists for humans to use as they see
fit. There is another current of thought, which has grown in
influence in recent years, which re-casts the relationship between
humanity and the rest of creation in different terms and provides a
different understanding of dominion.
