### 1

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints
who are in Ephesus, and are faithful in Christ Jesus: (ESV)
### 2

Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ. (ESV)
### 3

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has
blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly
places, (ESV)
### 4

even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that
we should be holy and blameless before him. In love (ESV)
The "in love" at the end of this verse should be connected with the
next verse. This would then be referring to the
[love of God](Love_of_God "Love of God") in his
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination") of the
[elect](index.php?title=Elect&action=edit&redlink=1 "Elect (page does not exist)").
However, even if "in love" should be placed with verse four, a
similar idea would result. Verse four begins with God's choosing
the elect before the world was, and verse five appears to go into a
more detailed explanation of what that choosing entailed, which is
adoption as sons. Either way, the "in love" seems to apply to
predestination.

### 5

he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ,
according to the purpose of his will, (ESV)
