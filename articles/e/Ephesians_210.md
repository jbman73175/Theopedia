“In salvation we must not so emphasize grace that we overlook the
salvation itself. The concept of salvation involves what we are
saved to as well as what we are saved from. We are saved to
holiness and good works (see Eph. 2:10). And holiness manifests
itself in good works.” — [John Murray](John_Murray "John Murray"),
*Romans*
