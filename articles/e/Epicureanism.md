"**Epicureanism** was an atomistic and naturalistic approach to
life that was promoted by its founder Epicurus (341–270 B.C.).
Promoting a form of hedonism, Epicureans believed that pleasure is
the beginning and end of a happy life. They held that there were
two levels of pleasures. First, there were “satisfaction” desires
such as food, drink, and sex. Second, there were deeper pleasures
such as friendship that occur when the satisfaction desires were
met. The Epicureans stressed retreat from a violent and cruel world
and the importance of cultivating and maintaining friendships."
