**Epiphanius** (ca 315â€“403), Bishop of Salamis (Cyprus), was a
strong defender of [orthodoxy](Orthodoxy "Orthodoxy"), known for
combating ([heresies](Heresy "Heresy")) during the troubled era in
the Christian Church following the
[Council of Nicaea](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils").

## Ecclesiastical life

His reputation for learning prompted his nomination and
installation as Bishop of Salamis on Cyprus in 367. He served as
bishop for nearly forty years, travelling widely to combat
unorthodox beliefs. He was present at a synod in Antioch (376)
where the [Trinitarian](Trinity "Trinity") questions were debated
against the heresy of
[Apollinarianism](Apollinarianism "Apollinarianism"). He upheld the
position of Bishop Paulinus, who had the support of Rome, over that
of Meletius, who was supported by the Eastern Churches. In 382 he
was present at the Council of Rome, again upholding the cause of
Paulinus. During a visit to Palestine in 394 he attacked
[Origen](Origen "Origen")'s followers and urged the Bishop of
Jerusalem to condemn his writings. Origen's writings were
eventually condemned at the
[Fifth Ecumenical Council](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils")
in 553. In 402 he was induced by Theophilus of Alexandria to travel
to a synod in Constantinople, where he argued against the supposed
heresy of [John Chrysostom](John_Chrysostom "John Chrysostom"). He
died at sea on his return journey to Cyprus in 403.

## Writings

His best-known book is the *Panarion* which means "Medicine-chest"
(also known as *Adversus Haereses*). Written between 374 and 377,
it forms a handbook for dealing with heretics, listing 80 heretical
doctrines, some of which are not described in any other surviving
documents from the time. The *Panarion* is a valuable source of
information on the Christian church of the fourth century. His
earliest known work is the *Ancoratus* ("well anchored"), which
includes arguments against [Arianism](Arianism "Arianism") and the
teachings of [Origen](Origen "Origen").
