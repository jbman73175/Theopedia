**The Episcopal Church** in the United States is a member of the
Worldwide [Anglican](Anglican "Anglican") Communion, churches
around the world that trace their roots to the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England") and have
given rise to a distinct form of Christianity, known as
Anglicanism. The Episcopal Church is made up of between two and
three million worshipers in about 7500 congregations across the
United States and related dioceses outside the US.

The Episcopal Church came into existence as an independent
denomination after the American Revolution when it was forced to
break with the Church of England on political grounds.
