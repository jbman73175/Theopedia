**Episcopal** refers to a form of church government in which the
office of [Bishop](Bishop "Bishop") is a key authoritative role.
The word *episcopal* is from the Greek word for *bishop*. In this
system, the local church is part of a hierarchy of clergy who
oversee and govern the church denomination. This usually involves
regional (diocese) bishops headed up by an Archbishop.
Denominations which operate with this form of polity include
[Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy"), the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church"),
[Anglicanism](Anglicanism "Anglicanism"),
[Methodism](Methodism "Methodism"), and
[Lutheranism](Lutheranism "Lutheranism").


## Scripture

**Timothy and Titus**

In his manuscript
*[Captains and Courts: A Biblical Defense of Episcopal Government](http://www.biblelighthouse.com/govt/captains_and_courts.htm)*,
the Rt. Rev. Ray Sutton writes:

> First, apart from the Melchizedekkal priesthood's structure itself,
> undoubtedly the strongest argument for Bishops is the fact that the
> Apostle Paul at the end of his ministry tells individuals, Timothy
> and Titus, to appoint Presbyters (Titus 1:6) Why doesn't he give
> this directive to the Presbytery? Instead, he uses Jethro-type
> language to describe their function. He says, "I charge you before
> God and the Lord Jesus Christ and elect angels that you observe
> these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality" (1
> Timothy 5:21). With this solemn charge, the Apostle sounds a note
> quite similar to the Melchizedekkal-Jethro advice to Moses,
> > Then I commanded your judges at that time, saying, "Hear the cases
> > between a man and his brother or the stranger who is with him. You
> > shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small as
> > well as the great; you shall not be afraid in any man's presence,
> > for the judgement is God's" (Deuteronomy 1:16-17).
> 
> According to this, the Apostle Paul gives almost identical
> instructions to Timothy, making him a captain over Presbyters since
> he as an inidividual is given specific authority to oversee regular
> Presbyters. More importantly, this would have been the perfect
> opportunity at the end of Paul's ministry for him to call in a
> Presbytery (synod) if the Presbyterian system had been the
> government of the early Church. But he didn't.

This indeed would be a key Scriptural argument for the episcopal
system.

**James and the Jerusalem Council**

Other arguments would be the role of [James](James "James") at the
[Jerusalem Council](index.php?title=Jerusalem_Council&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jerusalem Council (page does not exist)").
James clearly functioned as a captain, not just a moderator, for
the Council. He was a secondary [Apostle](Apostle "Apostle"), a
[Presbyter](index.php?title=Presbyter&action=edit&redlink=1 "Presbyter (page does not exist)")/[Bishop](Bishop "Bishop").

Acts 21:8 states "and he [Paul] went into James and all the elders
were present". Episcopalians would point out that this shows that
James was in charge. Paul didn't go to the
[Presbytery](index.php?title=Presbytery&action=edit&redlink=1 "Presbytery (page does not exist)"),
but to James. Church history also testifies to James as the "bishop
of [Jerusalem](Jerusalem "Jerusalem")".

**The Seven Angels of the Seven Churches in Asia-Minor**

A third argument, that coming out of [John](John "John")'s
[Book of Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation"),
states that the seven angels of the seven Churches symbolize the
bishop of each Church. It's been historically defended on the
grounds that Scripture repeatedly uses "messengers" (the literal
translation of the word "angel") and "stars" to symbolize people
-and almost always as ecclesiastical officers.

This was notably the view of the French reformer
[Theodore Beza](Theodore_Beza "Theodore Beza"), as well as the
[patristic](Patristic "Patristic") and
[medieval](index.php?title=Medieval&action=edit&redlink=1 "Medieval (page does not exist)")
[Church Fathers](Church_Fathers "Church Fathers").
