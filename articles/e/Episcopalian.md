**Episcopalian** comes from the word **episcopal**, derived from
the [Greek](Greek "Greek") word *epískopos*, meaning "overseer" and
from which we get the English word [bishop](Bishop "Bishop"). It
may refer to one who is a member of the Episcopal Church or the
form of [church government (polity)](Church_polity "Church polity")
found in the Episcopal Church.

The Episcopal Church is a member of the worldwide Anglican
Communion, the churches around the world that trace their roots to
the [Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England"), and
maintain a “communion” with it, hence the name
“[Anglican](Anglican "Anglican").”

## Episcopal church polity

In general, episcopal churches are those with bishops that adhere
to an episcopalian type of church governance. In the more specific
sense the term is applied to those particular churches associated
with the [Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England")
and [Anglican](Anglican "Anglican") churches.

The word "episcopal" is commonly used to distinguish between the
various organizational structures of
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") churches, thus the word
[presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") is used to describe
churches ruled by elected Elders (Greek *presbuteros*) while
"episcopal" is used to describe churches ruled by bishops. Others
are neither, being
[congregational](Congregational "Congregational") and local in
structure.

Other churches overseen by bishops, with a connection to the Church
of England yet **not** members of the Anglican Communion, include
the United Methodist Church. All [Methodist](Methodism "Methodism")
churches have their roots in Anglicanism because their founder,
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley"), was an Anglican priest in
England in the 1700s. Wesley held that bishops are merely
presbyters (elders) who have been chosen for a supervisory position
by the Church.

Churches that are members of the Anglican Communion are episcopal
churches in polity, and some are named "Episcopal." However, some
Anglican churches do not belong to the Anglican Communion, and not
all episcopally-governed churches are Anglican. The
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church"),
the Old Catholic Churches (member of the Anglican Communion), and
the [Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox")
churches are recognized, and also their bishops, by
[Anglicans](Anglican "Anglican").
