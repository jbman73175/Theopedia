**Epistemology** is the philosophical theory of knowledge. It
involves views of how knowledge is obtained, what knowledge is and
what qualifies or does not qualify as genuine knowledge or
truth.[[1]](http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/epistemology)

"What is knowledge? How do we get it? Is certainty a necessary
prerequisite of knowledge or can we know that the sun will rise
tomorrow even if we are not one hundred per cent sure? How much of
what we commonly believe deserves to be called ‘knowledge’ and how
much of it is mere opinion? Is knowledge relative to a culture? Is
all our knowledge derived through the senses or are there truths
about the world we can know a priori? When we do perceive, do we
actually make contact with 'the world? Or do we only ever make
contact with our own ideas? Are we fooling ourselves if we think we
can know anything at all?"

These are the types of questions that epistemology seeks to
answer.

## Theories

### Scripturalism

**Scripturalism** is a theory of epistemology in which the
Scriptures, and deductions from the Scriptures, are the foundation
of all knowledge. This theory rejects the idea that induction and
senses are able to give knowledge. Knowledge is often defined in
Scripturalism as justified true beliefs.
