## Author and date

The epistle of James is generally attributed to the brother of
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") however there is some question concerning
the authenticity of this claim. James is thought to have been
written in 49 A.D. prior to the Jerusalem council held in 50 A.d.

### James, brother of Jesus

James 1:1 states that the letter is from "[James](James "James"), a
servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ." Theoretically, this
could be any number of James', including a James not mentioned in
the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") account. The
traditional view on the authorship of this epistle is
[James, brother of Jesus](James,_brother_of_Jesus "James, brother of Jesus")
-- technically half-brother. Three arguments for this view are as
follows:

1.  The simplicity of the introduction seems to indicate that no
    further explanation was needed as to the identity of the James;
    certainly the brother of Jesus would not have needed a lengthy
    introduction.
2.  The author seems to have a great reverence for the Law, which
    would be consistent with the background of James.
3.  There are some linguistic similarities between the epistle and
    the speech of James in Acts 15.

Both [Origen](Origen "Origen") and [Eusebius](Eusebius "Eusebius")
attribute the book to
[James, brother of Jesus](James,_brother_of_Jesus "James, brother of Jesus").

### Pseudononymous author

Some scholars argue for a pseudononymous author of James. Reasons
cited for such a view could be any of the following:

-   There is a lack of reference to Jesus Christ Himself in the
    letter.
-   The superior level of [Greek](Greek "Greek") in the letter
    seems beyond what James, brother of Jesus, could have produced.
-   The reverence for the Law issue is countered with a discussion
    on whether or not the works referred to in James are works of the
    [Mosaic Law](index.php?title=Mosaic_Law&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mosaic Law (page does not exist)")
    or general good works.
-   The author appears to be well-versed in current Hellenistic
    philosophies.

Scholars holding to the traditional position are able to refute
these arguments fairly easily, especially in consideration to the
level of Greek used and the author's familiarity with Greek
philosophy.

## Blueprint

The epistle of James is generally divided into three sections:

-   Genuine Religion (1:1-27)
-   Genuine Faith (2:1 - 3:12)
-   Genuine Wisdom (3:13 - 5:20)

James wrote to Jewish Christians who had been scattered throughout
the Mediterranean world because of persecution. In their hostile
surroundings they were tempted to let intellectual agreement pass
for true faith. This letter can have rich meaning for us as we are
reminded that genuine faith transforms lives. We are encouraged to
put our faith into action. It is easy to say we have faith, but
true faith will produce loving actions towards others.

## Themes

Major themes contained with James include:

-   **Living Faith** - James wants believers not only to hear the
    truth, but also to do it. He contrasts empty faith (claims without
    conduct) with faith that works. Commitment to love and to serve is
    evidence of true faith. Living faith makes a difference. Make sure
    your faith is more than just a statement - it should also result in
    action. Seek ways of putting your faith to work.

-   **Trials** - In the Christian life there are trials and
    temptations. Successfully overcoming these adversities produces
    maturity and strong character. Don't resent troubles when they
    come. Pray for wisdom; God will supply all that you will need to
    face persecution or adversity. He will give you patience and keep
    you strong in times of trial.

-   **Law of Love** - We are saved by God's gracious mercy, not by
    keeping the law. But Christ gave us a special command, "You shall
    love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 19:19). We are to love and
    serve those around us. Keeping the law of love shows that our faith
    is vital and real. When we show love to others, we are overcoming
    our own selfishness.

-   **Wise Speech** - Wisdom shows itself in speech. We are
    responsible for the destructive results of our talk. The wisdom of
    God that helps control the tongue can help control all our actions.
    Accepting God's wisdom will affect your speech. Your words will
    convey true humility and lead to peace. Think before you speak and
    allow God to give you self-control.

-   **Wealth** - James taught Christians not to compromise with
    worldly attitudes about wealth. Because the glory of wealth fades,
    Christians should store up God's treasures through sincere service.
    Christians must not show partiality to the wealthy, nor be
    prejudiced against the poor. All of us are accountable for how we
    use what we have. We should not hoard wealth, but be generous
    toward others. In addition, we should not be impressed by the
    wealthy nor look down on those who are poor.
