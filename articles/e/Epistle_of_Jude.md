Jude wrote this letter in an effort to remind the church of the
need for constant vigilance - to keep strong in the faith and to
oppose heresy.

## Author and date

The book of Jude was written by Jude, the brother of both
[James](James "James") and [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"), about the year
65 A.D.

## Blueprint

While the book of Jude is rather short, being only 25 verses long,
it is generally divided into two sections:

-   The danger of false teachers (1-16)
-   The duty to fight for God's truth (17-25)

Jude wrote to motivate Christians everywhere to action. He wanted
them to recognize the dangers of false teaching, to protect
themselves and other believers, and to win back those who had
already been deceived. Jude was writing against godless teachers
who were saying that Christians could do as they pleased without
fear of God's punishment. While few teach this heresy openly in the
church today, many in the church act as though this were true. This
letter contains a warning against living a nominal Christian life.

## Themes

Major themes contained in Jude include:

-   **False Teachers** - Jude warns against false teachers and
    leaders who reject the lordship of Christ, undermine the faith of
    others, and lead them astray. These leaders and any who follow them
    will be punished. We must staunchly defend Christian truth. Make
    sure that you avoid leaders and teachers who distort the Bible to
    suit their own purposes. Genuine servants of God will faithfully
    portray Christ in their words and conduct.

-   **Apostasy** - Jude also warns against
    [apostasy](Apostasy "Apostasy"), the turning away from Christ. We
    are to remember that God punishes rebellion against him. We must be
    careful not to drift away from a faithfull commitment to Christ.
    Those who do seek to know the truth in God's Word are susceptible
    to apostasy. Christians must guard against any false teachings that
    would distract them from the truth preached by the apostles and
    written in God's Word.
