## Purpose

After Paul's successful evangelism work in
[Galatia](Galatia "Galatia"), the church of had suffered the
problem of
[Judaizers](index.php?title=Judaizer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Judaizer (page does not exist)")
preaching that Christians were still bound to some
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") laws and practices,
among others,
[circumcision](index.php?title=Circumcision&action=edit&redlink=1 "Circumcision (page does not exist)")
and certain dietary restrictions. Judaizers argued that Paul was
not a "real" apostle, claiming that in order to sugar-coat the
gospel, he had removed legal requirements. Paul replies by
reassuring his apostolic authority, and explains how legal
requirements perverts the Gospel. This is where the fundamental of
Christianity, [sola fide](Sola_fide "Sola fide") is introduced.

## Theology

It is in this book that the essential doctrine of justification by
faith in Christ alone is best explained. See verse 2:16, "...a man
is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus
Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus so that we
may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law,
because by observing the law no one will be justified."
