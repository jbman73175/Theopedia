## Authorship

Hebrews has been described by William L. Lane as "a delight for the
person who enjoys puzzles." It is no surprise then, that the
question of authorship was uncertain as early as the Church Father
[Origen](Origen "Origen"), whose opinion was recorded by
[Eusebius](Eusebius "Eusebius"), that "only God knows the truth"
regarding who wrote Hebrews (*Church History*
[6.25.14](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.xxv.html)).
Oddly enough, [Origen](Origen "Origen") still recommended that the
church should ascribe Pauline authorship to this work
(*Church History*
[6.25.13](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iii.xi.xxv.html)).

Generally, from around AD 400 to 1600, the author was traditionally
considered to be Paul. However, the epistle makes no internal claim
of authorship, which is inconsistent with the rest of Paul's
epistles. Also, while many of the letter's ideas are Pauline, the
writing style is substantially different than that of
[Paul's epistles](New_Testament#Pauline_Epistles "New Testament"),
nor does the epistle contain a discourse on Apostolic authority.
The author of the epistle also includes himself as a second
generation believer in chapter 2:3-4, this would seem to indicate
that Paul was not the author.

In addition to Paul, some have suggested Paul's companion Silas,
[Clement of Rome](Clement_of_Rome "Clement of Rome"),
[Luke](Luke "Luke"), or some unknown Alexandrian Christian. Some
modern scholars have also proposed Priscilla as a possible author.
A leading candidate is
[Barnabas](index.php?title=Barnabas&action=edit&redlink=1 "Barnabas (page does not exist)"),
first suggested around AD 300 by
[Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian"). Barnabas is considered a
leading candidate because his association with Paul may explain
some of the Pauline ideas contained within the epistle. He was also
proposed early (AD 300) as a possible author. The second leading
candidate is
[Apollos](index.php?title=Apollos&action=edit&redlink=1 "Apollos (page does not exist)"),
first suggested by [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther").
An association with Pauline thought helps Apollos to stand out as a
possible candidate for the author of the epistle. Furthermore some
of the Hellenistic "coloring" of the epistle could be accounted for
since Apollos was from Alexandria.

Modern scholarship has reached no strong consensus on the
authorship of the epistle.

## Place of Writing

The place of writing is perhaps the most difficult question to
answer as it relates to the introductory material surrounding the
Epistle to the Hebrews. The reference to the Italian brothers in
13.24 has lead some to suggest that it was written from Italy,
perhaps from Rome itself. However, the evidence here is not
conclusive. Others have suggested just as strongly that the
reference in 13.24 does not demand that the letter be written from
Italy. It could simply be referring to italian believers by
descent, though not by location.

## Date of Composition

There is much debate surrounding the date of the writing of the
Epistle to the Hebrews. However, unless
[Clement of Rome](Clement_of_Rome "Clement of Rome") was the author
it must have been written before AD 96, since Clement cites it in
that year. The author also refers to temple practices as if they
were still in function leading some to conclude that the date of
composition must be prior to AD 70. This does not need to be the
case though because the author is speaking specifically of the
[tabernacle](Tabernacle "Tabernacle"), not the temple, and the
Tabernacle had not been functioning for almost a thousand years. It
must then be concluded that there is no hard and fast date for the
writing of the Epistle to the Hebrews.

## Original Recipients

It is hard to say who the original readers were with any certainty
beyond the fact that they must have been familiar with the Hebrew
Bible and Jewish customs of the first century. Some have suggested
that the epistle was written to a community of Jews who had fled
Jerusalem (but had remained in Palestine) following the death of
Stephen. Others hold to Jerusalem as the location of the original
recipients. These options leave many questions however, and may not
be the most likely locations. Rome and Alexandria have also both
been suggested. Both cities had Jewish populations during the first
century AD, Alexandria more so than Rome. However, it is almost
impossible to know for certain were the original recipients resided
given available evidence.

## Canonicity

The early church appears to have accepted the book as Canonical.
Clement of Rome quoted the epistle in his letter to the Church at
Corinth in AD 96. Hebrews was also included in the lists of NT
books by Origen, Eusebius, Athanasius, Cyril, and finally by the
Council of Laodicea.
