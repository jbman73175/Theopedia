## Authorship

Romans was written by the Apostle [Paul](Paul "Paul").

## Structure

Historically, Romans has been considered a single argument by Paul
in which he makes a few major points in sequence. Thus most
scholars have broken Romans up into large blocks – usually 5 – and
assigned a major theme to them. This has caused problems, as the
general schema has had difficulty explaining the reason for the
order of, or inclusion of, some of the content – especially
chapters 9-11. There also has not been any consensus on what the
blocks should be, the most difficult issue is in the categorization
of chapter 5, whether it is part of the preceding section, of the
following, or whether it should be split in half and divided
amongst both. The table below shows three popular divisions of
Romans, and it shows the schema for a new emerging schema that is
focused on alternation. This new schema argues that Paul is
developing a single argument about universal salvation, but is
stopping at key points to consider and address possible Jewish
responses to what he has just said. Once Paul has addressed those
issues, he returns to the thread of his argument. These
alternations are called “G” sections (the main argument) and “H”
(the Jewish considerations).

The table below also shows this structure:

## Christology

Romans was not written to expound Paul’s Christology in the same
way that, for example, Colossians is.^[[2]](#note-1)^ In his
opening, Paul defines the gospel in terms of who Jesus is – his
human and divine natures (Rom 1:1-4). After that, however, the
focus settles on Jesus’ works rather than his
identity.^[[3]](#note-2)^ Regardless, it is possible to discern
Paul’s Christology within the letter, and to see how his logic
relies on his understanding of the nature of Christ.

### Titles of Jesus

Though the titles that Paul gives Jesus are not the only source of
his Christology, they contribute much to understanging how Paul
understood Jesus.

#### Son of God

In Romans, Jesus is often referred to as God’s son.^[[4]](#note-3)^
In the OT, the concept refers to both Israel and the King, but in
1st C Jewish thought it mostly applied to the expected
Messiah.^[[5]](#note-4)^ Apart from Rom 1:3-4, every time Jesus is
referred to as ‘God’s Son’ it is God who is the main topic of the
passage, not Jesus.^[[6]](#note-5)^ This suggests that Paul is
using the phrase as a commonly accepted way of referring to Jesus,
rather than actively teaching a doctrine of Jesus’ identity as
God’s son. That is, Paul and the Romans both accept that Jesus is
God’s Son, so there is no need for him to teach the fact.

The various ‘Son of God’ passage are revealing as to how Paul sees
Jesus’ relationship to the Father. God’s Gospel is about Jesus (Rom
1:9) and his great act of reconciliation is through Jesus (Rom
5:10) whom he sent (Rom 8:3) as a sacrifice (Rom 8:32). God also
predestined those who would believe in Jesus (Rom 8:29). These
passages show God taking the initiative, and Jesus the Son
submitting to him.

In Romans, Jesus is given the specific title ‘Son of God’ only once
(Rom 1:4), which makes it difficult to determine whether Paul means
something different to ‘the Son’. The context gives some help, Rom
1:3-4 reads ‘his Son who … was declared with power to be the Son of
God’ (HCSB). Moo points out that this is tautological unless ‘Son
of God’ is different in meaning to ‘son’.^[[7]](#note-6)^ It is
probable that Paul is deliberately connecting the Messianic title
‘Son of God’ with the divine ‘God’s Son’, showing that the Son was
declared to be both Son and Messiah.

#### Son of David

In Rom 1:3-4, Jesus is also called "David’s descendant" – referring
to [King David](King_David "King David"). Like 'Son of God,' this
phrase is a common Jewish title for the expected Messiah. Given
Paul’s preference for using 'Christ' to refer to Jesus as the
Messiah, it is most likely that he is deliberately highlighting
Jesus' humanity, and his natural descent from the man David.

#### Christ

Christos (*Grk. Χριστός*, [Christ](Christ "Christ") or
[Messiah](Messiah "Messiah")) is Paul's preferred title for
declaring Jesus’ Messianic status. Some have suggested that the
meaning of 'Christ' had faded and had effectively become Jesus'
'last name.' This view fails to take into account the many times
that ‘Jesus Christ’ is rendered ‘Christ Jesus’ or that ‘Christ’
appears independently, or with a definite article (ὁ Χριστός).
Along with Paul's use of 'Son of God' and 'Son of David,' it seems
apparent that the full Messianic meaning of the title is being
used. The title highlights the fact that Jesus fulfills Jewish
prophetic expectations, and also the nature of those expectations –
kingship and rescuing. Both of these aspects of the
[Work of Christ](index.php?title=Work_of_Christ&action=edit&redlink=1 "Work of Christ (page does not exist)")
are further developed in Romans – the salvation from sin won on the
cross, and the triumph over evil and dominion over the world
displayed in the resurrection.

### Lord

Lord is the most obscure, and the most potent of the titles given
to Jesus in Romans. The number of times and variety in which Jesus
is referred to as ‘Lord’ (approx. 44) shows that this is a
significant concept in Romans. Paul sees this title as so intrinsic
in the identity of Jesus, that he regularly uses the title alone as
a proper name, referring to Jesus.^[[8]](#note-7)^ The title holds
different meanings to ‘Christ’, as shown by the number of times
that Jesus is referred to as ‘the Lord Jesus Christ’.
^[[9]](#note-8)^

The frequent uses of the phrase ‘our Lord’ shows that ‘Lord’ is, at
the very least, a description of Jesus’ authority and
dominion.^[[10]](#note-9)^ The use of ‘our’ shows his exclusive
authority over the Church – ‘Christ is our Lord, not Caesar or sin
or any other power’. There is also the implication that there are
other powers that hold authority over other people – ‘Christ is our
Lord, but sin is your lord’. This is an individual authority –
Jesus is Lord over the individual Christian. In Romans, part of
salvation is accepting Jesus’ personal authority as Lord (Rom 10:9)
which implies wilful submission to him. Secondly, Jesus’ Lordship
is also not just over individuals who have accepted him, but over
the whole world, whether they recognise him or not. This is shown
in the fact that he will judge the world (Rom 2:16).

However, Paul’s use of Lord to describe Jesus is also strong
evidence for his divinity. Κυριος (kurios – Lord) is the standard
Greek translation for the Hebrew יהוה (YHWH – God’s name), and is
used as such in OT quotes in Romans.^[[11]](#note-10)^ When ‘Lord’
is used in a Jewish, or Jewish-aware context, the word often
implies ‘God’. In a Roman context, the word also refers to the
common claims of authority and semi-divinity made by Roman rulers
(κυριος καισαρ – Caesar is Lord).^[[12]](#note-11)^ One of the most
powerful uses of this title is Rom 10:9-13. Paul states that
salvation requires recognition of Jesus as Lord, and then quotes
Joel 2:32: “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be
saved”. As in other OT quotes, ‘Lord’ is translating, the original
Hebrew יהוה (YHWH, God). Paul is clearly linking Jesus and God
together. Rom 10:1 shows that Paul is talking about Jews, and Rom
10:13-14 implies that they do not know the one whom they need to
call on in order to be saved. Since the Jews knew the name of YHWH,
as revealed in the OT, Paul is clearly assuming that there is a
name for God that has been revealed, but is not known to the Jews –
the name of Jesus.

### Humanity

Jesus’ humanity is not a major theme in Romans, but it is obvious
that Paul saw him as fully human. Firstly, as Paul introduces his
Gospel in Rom 1:1-6, he describes Jesus as having a ‘human nature’
which is further described as being a biological descendent of
[David](King_David "King David") (Rom 1:3). Secondly, in Romans
5:12-19, Paul compares [Adam](Adam "Adam") to Jesus, calling each
of them ‘one man’. Here Paul is arguing that Jesus’ death counters
the sin of Adam, and the humanity of Jesus is a critical part of
his logic. This point is further expounded in Rom 8:3. This passage
is contentious because Paul describes Jesus as being ‘in the image
of sinful flesh’ (ομοιωματι σαρκος αμαρτιας). The language of
‘image’ has been used to justify [Gnostic](Gnostic "Gnostic") and
[docetic](index.php?title=Docetic&action=edit&redlink=1 "Docetic (page does not exist)")
readings of Paul, which argue that Jesus was not truly human, but
only ’’seemed to be’’. However, this reading conflicts with Rom 1:3
and Rom 5:12-19 as discussed above. It seems that Paul chose the
‘image’ language, not to distance Jesus from full humanity, but to
distance him from ’’sinful’’ humanity.^[[13]](#note-12)^ Thus,
while Jesus was truly human, he was ’’flesh’’ but not ’’sinful
flesh’’.

### Divinity

Jesus’ divinity is a much stronger theme in Romans than his
humanity. Strong evidence for this is Paul’s use of the title
‘Lord’ (κυριος), the implications of divinity that the title held
for both Jews and Gentiles, and the way that he applied OT texts
about God to Jesus (see discussion above). There are other
indications that, while not conclusive by themselves, build a
picture of Paul’s understanding of Jesus’ divinity.

Finally, the ‘sending’ language that Paul uses shows that Jesus is
not a normal human. Since God sent his son to take on the form of
flesh (Rom 8:3), this shows that Jesus existed before his human
birth. Of course, this is not proof that Jesus is part of the
eternal trinity, but it is further evidence that he is more than
human.

There are a few circumstances where the Greek grammar is ambiguous,
but viable interpretations indicate that Paul is calling Jesus
‘God’. The first is Rom 9:5. Some translators argue that this
passage should be rendered “… of Christ. May God who is over all be
forever blessed”. However, most modern translators and almost all
ancient authors prefer “… Christ who is God over all, forever
blessed”. Moo argues that the style supports the second
translation, and that it is unlikely that Paul would have added in
an independent doxology (“May God who is over all be forever
blessed”) that had no connection to the subject of the previous
passage (Christ). ^[[14]](#note-13)^ Thus the most common
translation (“… Christ who is God over all, forever blessed”) is
the most likely.

The second text is Rom 1:7. Most modern translations render this
passage “from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ”. However,
‘the Father’ and ‘Jesus Christ’ could be written in apposition to
‘God’, making the passage “from God: The Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ”. This possibility is less likely, but both passages suggest
that either Paul saw Jesus as very closely intertwined with God, or
he was very careless with his Greek grammar in these passages.
Considering the quality and precision of Paul’s Greek in the rest
of Romans and his other letters, it is unlikely that he was
accidentally ambiguous. Also, considering his history as a
persecutor of the Church for blasphemy, and the Jewish background
of his audience, it is very unlikely that Paul would have been
careless with his language when talking about the identity of God.

Though a number of these points are inconclusive or ambiguous, the
bulk of them taken together shows that Paul saw Jesus as being in
the very nature of God (Phil 2:6).

## Spirit

### The sign of the New Covenant

The [Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") is introduced very early in
Romans. Paul’s introduction of his Gospel about Christ states that
Jesus was declared to be the Son of God by the ‘Spirit of Holiness’
(Rom 1:4). This connection introduces the spirit as in integral
part of God’s salvation plan through Jesus, and of how Jesus is
presented in Romans. Paul’s second reference to the Spirit comes in
reference to Judaism (Rom 2:29). This passage refers to Old
Testament prophesies that looked forward to the
[New Covenant](New_Covenant "New Covenant") when the people of God
would have their hearts circumcised, and the Spirit of God would
dwell in them (Deut 10.16; 30.6; Jer 31.34, Ezek 11.19; 36.26-7;
37.1-14). Thus Paul sees the work of the Spirit in Christians as a
fulfillment of these prophesies, and a major sign of the New
Covenant. Paul is also drawing a contrast between the Spirit and
the [written Law](Torah "Torah"), saying that true Judaism is from
the Spirit, not the Law. Apart from Rom 5:5 (which will be
discussed later), the next reference to the Spirit (Rom 7:5-6)
continues the contrast between the Law and the Spirit, and
introduces two large sections developing those themes; Rom 7:7-25
and Rom 8:1-13. This small passage further develops the idea that
the central place that the Law filled in the
[Old Covenant](index.php?title=Old_Covenant&action=edit&redlink=1 "Old Covenant (page does not exist)")
is being filled by the Spirit in the New Covenant.

### Assurance in the New Covenant

Rom 8 again raises the contrast between Spirit and Law, arguing
that Christians are no longer part of the old age of sin and death,
but the new age of the Spirit. The exact role of the OT law in this
passage is disputed,^[[15]](#note-14)^ but it is clear that the
condemnation of the Old Covenant has been replaced by the New
Covenant of the Spirit. While the word ‘Spirit’ occurs very often
in Rom 8, the main theme of the passage is ’’Christian
assurance’’.^[[16]](#note-15)^. Paul’s discussion of the Spirit is
predominantly focused in the Spirit’s role in providing assurance
to God’s people. In this chapter, the Spirit is the sign that a
person is a follower of God. Those who have the spirit are God’s,
and those who do not are not (Rom 8:9). Here the Spirit is
described as both the Spirit of Jesus, and of God who raised Jesus
from the dead. Hence, if someone possesses the Spirit, they are
inhabited by the power that raised Jesus, and are assured of their
own resurrection (8:11).

The Spirit is also the means of our adoption as sons of God and
co-heirs with Christ, and is constantly assuring us of that fact,
and allowing us to call upon God as our Father (8:15-17). This is
what Paul is referring to as the ’’first fruits’’ of the Spirit ‘as
we wait adoption’ (8:23), implying that the adoption process of is
not fully finished. The final ‘stages’ of our adoption will come in
the resurrection when God’s children are finally revealed (8:19).
As the Spirit gives us the right to call on God as ‘Father’, he
also gives us the means and ability through prayer. Even when we do
not know what to pray, the indwelling Spirit intercedes for us
(8:27).

### Power of the New Covenant

Apart from assurance, the Spirit also empowers God’s children. Rom
5:5 describes the affect of the Spirit on the believer whom he
inhabits. The spirit is a source of hope and confidence, either
(depending on how you read the Greek grammar) convincing us of
God’s love for us or filling us with love for God (possibly both).
Rom 15:30 shows the Spirit filling us with love for other people as
well. In Rom 15:13 the power of the Spirit not only fills us with
love, but also joy and peace – echoing the themes introduces in Rom
5:1-5.

Not only does the Spirit empower God’s people to have love, joy and
peace, but he also empowers God’s mission of salvation. In Rom
15:18-19, Paul’s describes the Spirit as the power that is behind
the signs and miracles, which accompanies his mission of preaching
the Gospel. In Rom 15:16, the power of the Holy Spirit is working
through the ministry of Paul and others to sanctify Gentiles so
that they might be God’s holy people, set apart for him.

### Ethics of the New Covenant

Rom 14:17 continues the theme of the New Covenant, with Paul
switching to the language of ‘the Kingdom of God’ that is more
familiar on the lips of Jesus. Here he shows that righteousness,
peace and joy are all part of the new Kingdom, which is identified
with the Spirit. The context also links the Spirit-filled New
Covenant with ethical behavior, since Paul is using his teaching
about the nature of the Kingdom of God to underline his ethical
teaching. Rom 8 also shows this. As he teaches of the Spirit’s work
in assurance, Paul starts to spell out the ethical implications. As
people who are freed from the sinful nature into the Spirit, God’s
children are to live according to the Spirit and not the sinful
nature (Rom 8:5-8, 12). This anchors the ethical teaching of
chapters 12-15 in the indwelling of the Spirit, and the New
Covenant. Rom 9:1 shows the Spirit working with Paul’s conscience,
hinting at a further empowerment of the Spirit, as he helps us to
discern the right way to live in the New Covenant.
