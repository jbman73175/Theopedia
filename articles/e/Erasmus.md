**Desiderius Erasmus** (1466-1536), a Dutch humanist, scholar, and
theologian, was born at Rotterdam, Holland. He was a leading voice
in the theological debates of the early
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation") in northern Europe. He
contended with the reformer
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") (1483-1546),
emphasizing the importance of [free will](Free_will "Free will") in
human actions against Luther's belief in the absolute bondage of
the will to sin. In addition, Erasmus sought middle ground in the
conflict between Luther and Pope Adrian VI (1522-1523) and tried to
reconcile the two.

Though eager for church reform, Erasmus remained all his life
within the [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic")
Church. As a humanist he deplored the religious warfare of the time
because of the rancorous, intolerant atmosphere and cultural
decline that it induced.

Erasmus is generally acknowledged as the greatest classical scholar
of his time, though he was better at Latin than Greek (Schaff,
*Companion*, p. 230). But of far greater importance than the
revival of Greek studies was his editing and publishing of the
[Greek](Greek "Greek")
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament").

## Erasmus' Greek New Testament

At the encouragement of printer John Froben of Basle, Erasmus
embarked on a project to produce and publish the first Greek New
Testament in the West in over a 1000 years and the first to be
marketed. It was printed in 1516 with two columns - a Greek text on
the left and Erasmus' new Latin translation (made from the Greek)
on the right.

A 2nd Edition of Erasmus Greek and Latin Text was published in 1519
correcting numerous typographical errors.
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") used Erasmus's 2nd
edition to translate a German New Testament in 1522.

A 3rd Edition Erasmus' Text was published in 1522.
[William Tyndale](William_Tyndale "William Tyndale") utilized
Erasmus's 3rd edition in translating the first English New
Testament from the original language.

"After Erasmus' text had seen several revisions, Robert Estienne,
commonly referred to as Stephanus, published successive editions of
a Greek text. His first two editions were compounds of Erasmus'
text and the Complutensian Polyglot Bible (1520). However, the
third edition (1550) was based primarily on the fourth and fifth
editions of Erasmus' text. This 1550 edition gained wide acceptance
in England, and for many is synonymous with the *Received Text*.

"However, it was not until 1624 that the phrase, *Received Text*,
or in the Latin, *Textus Receptus*, was actually coined, and then
it was from the preface to the third edition of a Greek text
published by Bonaventure and Abraham Elzevir. The words were, as
described by Bruce Metzger, part of 'a more or less casual phrase
advertising the edition (what modern publishers might call a
'blurb').' The phrase boasted in Latin that the text presented was
'the text which is now received by all.' Thus came the phrase
Textus Receptus, or Received Text."

"Although much credit is due to Erasmus for having made a Greek
text available at all, the text which he presented was not of good
quality. The half dozen manuscripts used by Erasmus were all of
late origin. Most, if not all, were from the fifteenth century,
while two may have been made as early as the twelfth century. He
had only one manuscript which contained the book of Revelation, and
it was missing the final leaf, which had contained the last six
verses of Revelation. For these verses, Erasmus turned to the
Vulgate, a Latin translation of the scriptures. Erasmus translated
the Latin back to Greek."
