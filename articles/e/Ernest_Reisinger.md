**Ernest Reisinger** (1919 - 2004), a
[Reformed Baptist](Reformed_Baptist "Reformed Baptist") pastor, he
helped lay the foundation for what became the Founders Ministries,
which seeks to return Southern Baptists to their
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") beginnings. He began the
*Founders Journal* in 1990 and remained it's Associate Editor until
his death.

He came to faith in Christ in his mid-twenties, later made a public
profession of his faith at a Salvation Army meeting, and was
subsequently baptized in 1943 at a Southern Baptist Church in Havre
de Grace, Maryland. Although a Baptist, Reisinger had a close
association with paedo-baptists, having attended a Presbyterian
Sunday School and becoming a "registered member" of a paedo-baptist
church in Carlisle, Pennsylvania before he was baptized. Later, in
1946, Reisinger was even commissioned by the Carlisle Presbytery as
a "lay preacher".^[[1]](#note-0)^

Despite his early affiliation with
[Presbyterianism](Presbyterianism "Presbyterianism"), in the 1950s
he helped establish the Grace Baptist Church in Carlisle,
Pennsylvania. As time passed, the Carlisle church decided that
Reisinger should be ordained. In 1971, "the charge to the church"
at the ordination service was brought by the popular Dr.
[Cornelius Van Til](Cornelius_Van_Til "Cornelius Van Til") of the
Westminster Seminary.

After his ordination Reisinger served as pastor to churches in
Islamorada and North Pompano in Florida. These were Southern
Baptist churches, and, by the 1980's he was playing a leading role
in working for the recovery of the doctrines of grace in that
denomination. He demonstrated that this was a recovery, not an
introduction, by directing the reprinting of
[James Boyce](James_Boyce "James Boyce")'s *Abstract of Theology*.
To the last he remained the Associate Editor of The Founders
Journal: Committed to Historic Southern Baptist Principles.
