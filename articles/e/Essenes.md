Though the **Essenes** of the
[Dead Sea Scrolls](Dead_Sea_Scrolls "Dead Sea Scrolls") are not
mentioned in the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"),
they are described by
[Philo](index.php?title=Philo&action=edit&redlink=1 "Philo (page does not exist)"),
[Josephus](Josephus "Josephus"), and
[Eusebius](Eusebius "Eusebius"). With publication of the Essenes'
own sectarian writings since the 1950s, however, they have become
well known. Their withdrawal into desert seclusion was in
opposition to the ruling powers in the city and the Temple of
Jerusalem. They lived apart from society in constant study of the
Scriptures and with a firm belief that they were the elect of
Israel living in the end of days and to whom would come messianic
figures—a messiah of [David](David "David") (royal) and a messiah
of [Aaron](Aaron "Aaron") (priestly). After a long period of
probation and initiation, a man became a member of this elect
community that had strict rules of community discipline that would
seal or destroy his membership in their
[New Covenant](New_Covenant "New Covenant").

Their laws were strict, their discipline severe, and — unlike
[Pharisees](Pharisees "Pharisees"),
[Sadducees](Sadducees "Sadducees"), and Zealots — they were not
simply different parties within Judaism but a separate
[eschatological](Eschatology "Eschatology") sect. They believed
that they alone, among those living in the end time, would be
saved. The apocalypticism of the Essenes and the early Christians
had many similarities, but the Christians had a higher
eschatological intensity because they already knew who the Messiah
would be when he came in the future at the
[Parousia](Parousia "Parousia") (the "Second" Advent), and they
also had a recollection of the earthly [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"),
knowledge of the risen Lord, and the gift of the Spirit upon the
church. Both Essenes and Christians were sects with tightly knit
organizations, but the church had a historically based messiah. The
Essenes probably were killed or forced to flee from their
wilderness community c. AD 68, yet some of their ideas can still be
traced in the ministry of
[John the Baptist](John_the_Baptist "John the Baptist") (who might
have been an Essene) and in the thought world of the New Testament
(see also [Judaism](Judaism "Judaism")).
