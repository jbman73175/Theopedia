**Essential doctrines** are particular doctrines that an
[orthodox](Orthodox "Orthodox") Christian is expected to hold. One
who has recently received Christ is not expected to fully
understand or articulate doctrines like that of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") and the
[Deity of Christ](Deity_of_Christ "Deity of Christ"), however, if
he comes to reject these "essential doctrines" he no longer falls
within orthodox Christianity. Therefore it is important to note
what doctrines are rejected by a person or group, as well as what
doctrines are affirmed.

A common list of essential doctrines would be:

-   The [deity](Deity_of_Christ "Deity of Christ") and
    [humanity](Humanity_of_Christ "Humanity of Christ") of Christ
-   The doctrine of the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") (including the
    [deity of the Holy Spirit](Deity_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Deity of the Holy Spirit"))
-   [Virgin birth of Jesus](Virgin_birth_of_Jesus "Virgin birth of Jesus")
-   [The bodily resurrection of Christ](Resurrection "Resurrection")
-   [Salvation by grace through faith](Salvation "Salvation")
-   The [second coming](Second_coming "Second coming") of Christ
-   The existence of [Heaven](Heaven "Heaven") and
    [Hell](Hell "Hell")
-   the [Resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection") of the dead
-   [Life everlasting](Eternal_life "Eternal life")

The most common lists of essential doctrines define
[orthodoxy](Orthodox "Orthodox") such that it would include most
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") denominations as well as
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism") and
[Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy").
Critical doctrines coming out of the Protestant
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation"), such as
[justification by faith alone](Faith_alone "Faith alone")
(*Sola Fide*) and the
[sole authority of Scripture](Scripture_alone "Scripture alone")
(*Sola Scriptura*) are often argued as "essential" by Protestants,
but not so by the general academic community.
