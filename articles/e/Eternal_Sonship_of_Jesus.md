"The doctrine of **Eternal Sonship** simply affirms that the second
person of the triune Godhead has eternally existed as the Son. In
other words there was never a time when He was not the Son of God
and there has always been a Father/Son relationship within the
Godhead. This doctrine recognizes that the idea of Sonship is not
merely a title or role that Christ assumed at some specific point
in history, but that it is the essential identity of the second
person of the Godhead. According to this doctrine, Christ is and
always has been the Son of God."

### Walter Martin

"The Scripture nowhere calls Jesus Christ the eternal Son of God,
and He is never called Son at all prior to the incarnation, except
in prophetic passages in the Old Testament. The term "Son" itself
is a functional term, as is the term "Father" and has no meaning
apart from time. . . . Many heresies have seized upon the confusion
created by the illogical "eternal Sonship" or "eternal generation"
theory of Roman Catholic theology, unfortunately carried over to
some aspects of Protestant theology. Finally; there cannot be any
such thing as eternal Sonship . . . . the word "Son" definitely
suggests inferiority." -*The Kingdom of the Cults*, pp. 117-118
