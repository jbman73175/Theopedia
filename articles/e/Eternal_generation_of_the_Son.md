The **eternal generation of the Son** is defined as "an eternal
personal act of the [Father](God_the_Father "God the Father"),
wherein, by necessity of nature, not by choice of will, He
generates the person (not the essence) of the Son, by communicating
to Him the whole indivisible substance of the Godhead, without
division, alienation, or change, so that the Son is the express
image of His Father's person, and eternally continues, not from the
Father, but in the Father, and the Father in the Son."
^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Brief explanation

The name "Creator" or "Savior" refer to acts of God's will, but in
contrast his name as Father to the Son is a revelation of the
identity of God *Himself*. The Father brings forth the Son by the
act of being God, not by an act of will, so that the Son fully
shares in the Father's deity and glory as God. There has never
been, nor is it possible for there to be, any God and Father
without the Son.

God is an absolutely simple being. There are not three gods. There
are not three Lords. There are not three parts of God. Rather,
there are three who are Lord, three who are God, three who are One.
The Father is not changed by being Father to the Son; Father, Son
and Holy Spirit are one God eternally. The Son is not divided from
the Father by being the Son; the Son is as near to the Father as
the Father is to himself. There is distinction among the divine
Persons, but there is no separation.

By simply being God, the Son expresses the Father's person and
being. Whoever sees the Son, sees the Father; that is, the Father
is revealed to whomever the Father chooses to reveal the Son. Only
God can reveal God. "No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is
at the Father's side, he has made him known" (John 1:18; ESV).
"That they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in
you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe
that you have sent me" (John 17:21).

## "Eternally begotten" compared to "born of"

This doctrine suggests that Jesus, the Son of God, conceived by the
Holy Spirit and born of the virgin, and declared to be the Son of
God when raised up by the Spirit of God, manifests in human and
therefore derivative terms an eternal and unchanging mystery
concerning the relationship between the Father and the Son.

## Historical development

### Nicene Creed

"I believe...in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of
God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of
Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one
substance with the Father, by whom all things were made."

*See main page on [Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed")*
### Augustine

To speak of the "begottenness" or "generation" of the Son implies
an analogy to God in human nature. When God speaks of himself as
Father and Son, it suggests a social likeness to himself in man,
who is made in God's image. Similarly, when he speaks of Himself as
God and Word of God, it suggests likeness to God in man's modes of
self-awareness, a "psychological analogy". When meditating on
distinctions between the persons in the Trinity, for example,
Augustine discovered something comparable (analogous) in the
distinct modes of his own intellect, heart, and will. Similarly,
there is a creaturely trinity of wisdom, knowledge of wisdom, and
delight in that knowledge, that can be shown to be analogous to
God:

Does that wisdom which God is said to be, not perceive itself, and
not love itself? Who would say this? Or who is there that does not
see, that where there is no knowledge, there in no way is there
wisdom? Or are we, in truth, to think that the Wisdom which is God
knows other things, and does not know itself; or loves other
things, and does not love itself? But if this is a foolish and
impious thing to say or believe, then behold we have a trinity,—to
wit, wisdom, and the knowledge wisdom has of itself, and its love
of itself. For so, too, we find a trinity in man also, i.e. mind,
and the knowledge wherewith mind knows itself, and the love
wherewith it loves itself.^[[2]](#note-1)^
As Augustine observes, these distinct modes of human self-awareness
do in fact correlate rather compellingly, with the way we think
about the unity and diversity of the Father, Son and Spirit.
However, even as Augustine explored such trinities in nature, he
became increasingly aware that there is no temporal thing to which
God, the Trinity, can be adequately compared.

"Directing my course according to this rule of faith, insofar as I
could, and insofar as You made it possible for me, I sought You,
and desired to see with my understanding that which I believed, and
I have argued and labored much. O my Lord, my God, my only hope,
hear me lest through weariness I should not wish to seek You, but
may ardently seek Your face evermore. . . .Deliver me, O God, from
the multitude of words with which I am inwardly afflicted in my
soul; it is wretched in Your sight, and takes refuge in Your mercy.
For I am not silent in my thoughts, even when I am silent in my
words ... "^[[3]](#note-2)^
Analogies to the Trinity, to the Son begotten and the Spirit
proceeding, are so readily found in creation that it is tempting to
imagine that the comparison can be reversed, to learn something
really new about God from the created things. But, Augustine
learned that while he was delighted to find that likenesses to God
as He has revealed himself can be found everywhere in creation and
especially within man himself, it became an exhausting burden on
his mind and soul to try to go in the other direction, to "see with
(his) understanding that which (he) believed". It is idolatry to
simply equate God with the likenesses to him that we find in
creation. We are put in danger of stopping this way, short of
knowing God Himself, Augustine complains, because of the oppressive
weariness produced by longing to understand Him who is beyond
understanding. Therefore we must continually strive to know God,
although this leaves us restless awaiting his appearing. God is
incomparable and beyond understanding, Augustine concluded, and yet
because He has revealed himself to us, we are able to see with our
minds that man is made in the likeness of God.

### Jonathan Edwards

"The Father is the deity subsisting in the prime, unoriginated and
most absolute manner, or the deity in its direct existence. The Son
is the deity [eternally] generated by God's understanding, or
having an idea of Himself and subsisting in that idea. The Holy
Ghost is the deity subsisting in act, or the divine essence flowing
out and breathed forth in God's infinite love to and delight in
Himself. And . . . the whole Divine essence does truly and
distinctly subsist both in the Divine idea and Divine love, and
that each of them are properly distinct persons." ^[[4]](#note-3)^
Edwards comes very near to literally equating God's essence with
rational thought, defining the relationships within God as aspects
of the process of reasoning. The tendency to rationalize the
Trinity has plagued Evangelical theology, and Edwards' comment
typifies this problem.

### Robert L. Dabney

"In a word, the generation of the Son, and procession of the
Spirit, however mysterious, are unavoidable corollaries from two
facts. The essence of the Godhead is one; the persons are three. If
these are both true, there must be some way, in which the Godhead
multiplies its personal modes of subsistence, without multiplying
or dividing its substance. The Scriptures call one of these modes a
'genesi' and the other an 'ekporeusi.' We hence learn two truths.
The Second and Third substances are eternally propagated in
dissimilar modes. The inscrutable mode of the Second substance
bears some mysterious analogy to the generation of human sons."
^[[5]](#note-4)^
Although Dabney speaks of a "Second" substance and a "Third"
substance, he evidently means by "substance" the same thing that he
says earlier using the word "subsistence" – that is, that God is
one undivided substance (being), not three beings; and therefore he
concludes that the idea expressed by "generation" and "procession"
is necessary in order to maintain that each of the three Persons is
a **distinct** subsistence of the one God, as opposed to a
*separate* or *divided* being (substance).

### Westminster Confession of Faith

"In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one
substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and
God the Holy Ghost: the Father is of none, neither begotten, not
proceeding; **the Son is eternally begotten of the Father**; the
Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son." (WCF
II.3)

### Common arguments for the doctrine

-   "[It] is virtually implied in the very relation of terms,
    Father and His Son, Father and His pneuma, by the primariness of
    order always assigned to the Father, and by the distinction in the
    order of working." ^[[6]](#note-5)^
-   It grounds economic order according to an order of
    relationship; rather than the reverse. It is unbiblical, and
    implicitly tri-theistic, to imagine for example that the Father
    might have been the Son had the three persons decided differently.
-   It is the only doctrinal discussion of the deity of Christ that
    depends directly on Biblical language for its basic content, for
    example:

John 1:1
John 1:1
John 3:16
John 5:20
[John 5:26](John_5#26 "John 5")
John 14:11
John 17:21
John 10:38
Hebrews 1:3
Psalm 2:7 (quoted in Acts 13:33 & Hebrews 1:5; 5:5)
## Opposition

Because the terminology of "generated" and "begotten" can be
mistaken to imply a temporal or even a fleshly analogy, there have
been objections to this terminology, even though these terms are
used to refer to the mysterious and eternal relationship between
the Father and the Son. Nevertheless, it is confessional Reformed
orthodoxy that Jesus Christ reveals eternal relationships within
God, which are not arbitrary or reversible "roles": he is eternally
the Son to the Father, without any implication of
[ontological subordination](Subordinationism "Subordinationism").^[[7]](#note-6)^^[[8]](#note-7)^
However, some Reformed theologians, in recent times notably
[Loraine Boettner](Loraine_Boettner "Loraine Boettner") and
[Robert Reymond](Robert_Reymond "Robert Reymond"), object to what
they perceive as a confusion of the way God has chosen to enact his
will (the
"[economic Trinity](Economic_Trinity "Economic Trinity")"), with
who and what God is as God (the
"[immanent Trinity](Immanent_Trinity "Immanent Trinity")"). Such
objections are comparable to some Eastern Orthodox theology, such
as that of
[Gregory Palamas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Palamas "w:Gregory Palamas"),
which teaches that God is not at all knowable in his essence but in
his energies only: that is, what he wills may be known if he so
chooses, but God as such transcends revelation and therefore he is
hidden rather than revealed by words and names. In Eastern Orthodox
theology, at least, this approach leads to an
[apophatic (negative)](Apophatic_theology "Apophatic theology")
approach to knowing God - a theology by negation of rational
assertions. This contrasts with
[cataphatic theology](Cataphatic_theology "Cataphatic theology"),
which demands acceptance of assertions made by God concerning
himself — an approach which otherwise characterizes the work of
these Reformed theologians.

### Loraine Boettner

[Loraine Boettner](Loraine_Boettner "Loraine Boettner") argues in
[*The Trinity*](http://www.jude3.net/boettner_trinity.htm) that the
Son and Spirit are not in any sense "dependent upon another as
their principal *cause*", which would seem to suggest that Boettner
misunderstood the doctrine as teaching that generation and
procession are *effects* rather than acts of communication entirely
without change in being. He evidently is concerned with protecting
against the implication that the Father exists prior to the Son and
Spirit, when he says:

"... when the Scriptures tell us that one Person within the Trinity
is known as the "Father," and another as the "Son," they intend to
teach not that the Son is originated by the Father, nor that the
Father existed prior to the Son, but that they are the same in
nature."^[[9]](#note-8)^
In this, Boettner departs from the Nicene Creed and supposes that
he may enlist Calvin for support, but based on a misunderstanding
of Nicea. Under his discussion of the procession of the Spirit,
Boettner goes farther, to strongly suggest that each of the Persons
is an autonomous entity, arguing that generation and procession
imply subordination or derivation of being:

"[W]ithin the essential life of the Trinity no one Person is prior
to, nor generated by, nor proceeds from, another, and that such
priority and subordination as we find revealed in the works of
creation, redemption and sanctification, relate not to the immanent
but to the economic Trinity." ^[[10]](#note-9)^
Boettner's view of Nicene-Chalcedonian Trinitarianism conflicts
with the orthodox understanding of it, that the Son has eternal
relation to the Father by eternal communication, by eternally
sharing in the Father's being and glory as the one God, without
subtraction from the Father, without dividing his being, without
multiplying entities, and without the Father adding to Himself.

### Robert Reymond

Reymond discusses his objections in
*A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith*.
^[[11]](#note-10)^ Departing from orthodox Reformed theology of the
Trinity, Reformed theologian
[Robert Reymond](Robert_Reymond "Robert Reymond") is rather
emphatic in his rejection of eternal generation and procession. For
Reymond, it is clear that Father, Son, and Spirit relate in
covenant; he places distinctive emphasis on the equal
self-existence of each person and the arbitrariness of the roles
enacted by them. The subordination in their roles in salvation
indicate nothing about what they are ontologically; and therefore,
the name "Father, Son and Holy Spirit" is not a revelation of who
God is, but rather only a revelation of God's purposes.

#### Reymond on Calvin

Robert Reymond includes [John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin")
among those who reject any form of dependence ("subordination") of
the Son to the Father with respect to the divine essence.
^[[12]](#note-11)^ He explains Calvin's view as such,

[T]here is no question that Calvin espoused the doctrine of the
Son's eternal generation as being true with respect to his
hypostatic identity, that is, with respect to his Sonship, and he
employed the doctrine to distinguish between the Father and the Son
as to their order, but he did not espouse the doctrine as being
true with respect to the Son's divine essence. ^[[13]](#note-12)^
While Reymond interprets Calvin as accepting the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed"), he argues that Calvin
was critical of its language. ^[[14]](#note-13)^ Even Warfield
noted that Calvin "refused to treat any human composition as an
authoritative determination of doctrine, from which decline only on
the pain of heresy: that belongs to the Word of God alone."
^[[15]](#note-14)^ Calvin's hesitancy about eternal generation
eventually came down to the act of continually begetting: "But,
studying the edification of the Church, I have thought it better
not to touch upon many things, which would be unnecessarily
burdensome to the reader, without yielding him any profit. For to
what purpose is it to dispute, whether the Father is always
begetting? For it is foolish to imagine a continual act of
generation, since it is evident that three Persons have subsisted
in God from all eternity."^[[16]](#note-15)^ Interestingly, the
same passage of Calvin's *Institutes* is cited for support by
Boettner.

[Robert Letham](Robert_Letham "Robert Letham") has critiqued
Reymond for his "shoddy" handling of Calvin's
views.^[[17]](#note-16)^ "Reymond cites one short paragraph from
[Warfield’s](B.B._Warfield "B.B. Warfield") fine article 'Calvin’s
Doctrine of the Trinity' to argue that Calvin rejected Nicene
trinitarianism (334-35). This article is ninety-five pages long and
Warfield repeatedly affirms Calvin’s approval of the
Niceno-Constantinopolitan doctrine of the trinity. For instance,
'It will have already become apparent... that in his doctrine of
the Trinity Calvin departed in nothing from the doctrine which had
been handed down from the orthodox Fathers.’ [Warfield] also
underlines Calvin’s 'pervasive' approval of eternal generation and
eternal procession (244-45). From this long article Reymond
extracts one small paragraph and uses it to counter all Warfield
has carefully stated over scores of pages."^[[18]](#note-17)^ Ralph
Allan Smith suggests in his article *Tritheism and Christian Faith*
that, viewed according to certain critical criteria,
[J. Oliver Buswell](J._Oliver_Buswell "J. Oliver Buswell") and
Robert Reymond hold a version of Trinitarianism that "tends
implicitly towards tritheism". By denying any dependency on the
Father at all, the rejection of eternal generation and procession
tends to imply without actually asserting it, that the Son and
Spirit are independent and autonomous beings (that is, Smith sees
Reymond's view as "defective" but not heretical).
^[[19]](#note-18)^

### Common objections

-   "Eternal generation" safeguards the idea that, the sonship of
    Christ is his equality with the Father as God, in contrast to any
    subordination or derivation. However, the language simplistically
    understood strongly suggests the very error that it is intended to
    safeguard against.
-   The Son is *neither more nor less* dependent on the Father in
    order to be God, than the Father is dependent upon the Son and the
    Spirit, because there is no God other than the one God: Father, Son
    and Spirit. However, the language of "generation", misunderstood,
    suggests that the Son is not equally God, but in some sense comes
    into being - which is
    [ontological subordinationism](Subordinationism "Subordinationism").
-   It was developed to an extraordinary, speculative excess by
    [Origen](Origen "Origen"), on account of whom, the doctrine is
    often thought to teach that the Son is a subordinate (i.e.
    derivative) aspect of God's being. "Generation" was also the
    preferred terminology of the Arians and Eunomians, over against the
    orthodox, until the Council of Nicea robbed the heretics of their
    argument. Nevertheless, some regard the terminology as being
    tainted by these controversies.
-   In the Scriptures, "Son of God" never unequivocally refers to
    Jesus in a pre-incarnate state. Some therefore reject the idea of
    [Eternal Sonship](Eternal_Sonship "Eternal Sonship"), not denying
    that God is eternally triune but intending only to deny that there
    is "eternal generation". Dabney describes this "incarnational
    sonship" view:
    "But among Trinitarians themselves there are some, who give to
    Christ's Sonship a merely temporal meaning. They believe that the
    Second and the Third persons are as truly divine as we do; they
    believe with us, that there is a personal distinction, which has
    been eternal; but they do not believe that the terms generation and
    [procession](Procession_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Procession of the Holy Spirit")
    were ever intended by Scripture to express that eternal relation.
    On the contrary, they suppose that they merely denote the temporal
    functions which the persons assume for man's redemption." - Robert
    L. Dabney ^[[20]](#note-19)^

However, the denial that the Son is always the Son of the Father
suggests that God changes his understanding of Himself in order to
reveal himself. This is called *voluntarism*, which is a false
teaching that the truth concerning God is only what He wills it to
be. Accordingly, the voluntarist tendency denies that what God
reveals concerning himself has any necessary relation to what God
is as God. In contrast, we are told that God cannot lie, because he
is incapable of denying himself - and therefore, when we are
baptized into the name of "Father, Son and Spirit" we are placed
into reliance upon God revealed truly and fully by Him who is the
fullness of the Truth, Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
