"Some of the older theologians, when expounding this doctrine,
contended for the **eternal justification** of the elect, affirming
that God pronounced them righteous before the foundation of the
world, and that their justification was then actual and complete,
remaining so throughout their history in time, even during the days
of their unregeneracy and unbelief; and that the only difference
their faith made was in making manifest God's eternal justification
in their consciences."
[Arthur Pink](http://biblestudy.churches.net/CCEL/P/PINK/JUSTIFIC/JUSTIFI8.HTM)

[Abraham Kuyper](Abraham_Kuyper "Abraham Kuyper") is a notable
proponent of the doctrine of Justification from Eternity.

## Quotes

-   "God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect,
    and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and
    rise again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not
    justified, until the Holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply
    Christ unto them." - [John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin")

-   "The decree of justification is one thing; justification itself
    another â€” as the will to save and sanctify is one thing; salvation
    and sanctification itself another. The will or decree to justify
    certain persons is indeed eternal and precedes faith itself, but
    actual justification takes place in time and follows faith."
    [Francis Turretin](Francis_Turretin "Francis Turretin"),
    *Institutes of Elenctic Theology*, 2:683.
