The term **eternal life** is a central theme found in the
[Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John"). The very purpose
of John's gospel was that "you may believe that
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") is the [Christ](Christ "Christ"), the Son of
God, and that by believing you may have life in his name" (Jn
20:31; cf. 1 Jn 5:13), "life" being synonymous with "eternal life".
Jesus says that, "this is eternal life: that they may know you, the
only true [God](God "God"), and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent"
(John 17:3). Interesting to note, knowing God does not precede or
follow eternal life. Instead, knowing God *is* eternal life. "Those
who know God in the present have an incorruptible fellowship with
God that cannot be severed or impugned by death" (Thompson, p.
380). Furthermore, Jesus says that "I have come that they may have
life, and have it to the full."
[Marshall](I._Howard_Marshall "I. Howard Marshall") believes that
"the most comprehensive term in John for what Jesus gives to people
is *life* or *eternal life*, which is to be understood as sharing
in the life of God [John 1:4] (Marshall, p. 520).Thus,
understanding the term *eternal life* is of great importance to the
Christian life.

Scholars have speculated on John's usage of "eternal life" as
opposed to the
[Synoptic Gospel's](Synoptic_Gospels "Synoptic Gospels") use of of
"[Kingdom of God](Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God")". Some suggest
that John uses this term "to accent the personal and
individualistic aspects of [salvation](Salvation "Salvation")". On
the other hand, some believe that his use conveys "the inner
experience of salvation more aptly than a term like
*kingdom of God*" (Thompson). However, the Synoptics do in fact use
the terms *eternal life* and *kingdom of God* as equivalent terms
(Mk 9:43, 45, 47; 10:17-30; Matt 19:23-29; Luke 18:24-30), and so
they are to be understood as synonymous terms.

### Background

The background of the term is to be seen in light of first century
Jewish thought. Jews had a vision of the "life of the age to come"
that the righteous were to inherit. Scholars believe that John
picks up on this idea, equating "eternal life" with this very idea
so that it is understood as "the state of blessedness that one
participates in through faith in Jesus" (Thompson). Furthermore,
Jesus said to the Jews, "You diligently study the Scriptures
because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are
the Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me
to have life" (Jn 5:39-40). [Ladd](George_Ladd "George Ladd")
writes that "it was commonplace in rabbinic teachings that the
study of the [Torah](Torah "Torah") would lead to "life in the Age
to Come" (p. 292).

### Eternal life and the future

A striking reality is that John's gospel presents salvation, or
eternal life, in the present tense (Jn 5:24-26). Although it may
appear odd to have the "life of the age to come" in the present,
John's gospel presents aspects of this idea, sometimes known as
[realized eschatology](index.php?title=Realized_eschatology&action=edit&redlink=1 "Realized eschatology (page does not exist)").
The term is used to convey the idea that aspects of the
[end times](End_times "End times") are present now with believers.
John's gospel does not put forth this view in its entirety,
instead, it simply finds greater emphasis than in other books of
the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"). Jesus has come
down from heaven to give life *now* (Jn 6:33), for his words are
life (Jn 6:63),the [Father's](God_the_Father "God the Father")
commands lead to eternal life (Jn 12:49-50), and even Jesus himself
can say "I am the life" (Jn 11:25; 14:6). Yet, one of John's best
known images for the presence of salvation is the term "born again"
(Jn 3:5-21; cf. Jn 1:13). This conveys the idea that people are
without life until they receive the divine gift, a gift that can be
received and experienced in the present (Marshall, p. 520).

The eschatological character of John's usage of eternal life is
also evident in Jesus' saying, "The man who loves his life will
lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep
it for eternal life" (Jn 12:25). This saying marks the
understanding of two ages, this age and the age to come (Ladd, p.
293; cf. Daniel 12:2). The life is eternal in that those who
receive it will never perish (Jn 3:16; 6:27; 10:28).

## Quotes

-   “The ‘race set before us’ is an uncommon foot race, for the
    victor’s wreath of life that we pursue is the life that already
    courses through our mortal bodies by God’s Spirit (Romans 8:11).
    This is not the rhetoric of a sports commentator reporting on the
    marathon at the Olympics: ‘The runners are already empowered by the
    gold.’ It is much more than desire for the gold that invigorates
    runners in this uncommon race. For we are affirmed that although
    eternal life is God’s prize of salvation that we pursue with eager
    hope, eternal life is also the gift of grace that already
    invigorates us with the resurrection life so that we run the race
    with perseverance. Eternal life is the reward that we trust God
    will give to us who faithfully endure to the end of the race. Yet
    eternal life is also the very breath of heaven that already fills
    our hearts by God’s Spirit and enlivens our ‘feeble arms and weak
    knees’ (Hebrews 12:12) to ‘run the race set before us’ (Hebrews
    12:1).”
