The **Eternality of God** refers to his timeless nature. God had no
beginning, and will have no end.

This is one of the foundational beliefs of Christianity. If God is
not eternal, then eternal life is not His to give to anyone. Also
if God had a beginning He too would have to have a creator, at
which point he is not the one true God. Without the eternality of
God, Christianity is futile.

God's eternal Nature is very important to us because it ensures
that God will *always* be there for us. Whenever we need Him, no
matter when we are troubled, our eternal God will *always* be there
for us.

There are numerous references throughout scripture about God's
eternal nature.

-   Isaiah 57:15, "For thus says the One who is high and lifted up,
    who inhabits eternity..."
-   1 Timothy 1:17, "To the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the
    only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen."
