Eusebius of Caesarea
**Eusebius of Caesarea** (circa 275 to 339) was bishop of Caesarea
in Palestine and is often referred to as the father of church
history because of his work in recording the history of the early
[Christian](Christianity "Christianity") church. An earlier history
by Hegesippus that he referred to has not survived.

## Biography

His exact date and place of birth are unknown, and little is known
of his youth. He became acquainted with the presbyter Dorotheus in
Antioch and probably received exegetical instruction from him. In
296 he was in Palestine and saw Constantine who visited the country
with Diocletian. He was in Caesarea when Agapius was bishop and
became friendly with Pamphilus of Caesarea, with whom he seems to
have studied the text of the [Bible](Bible "Bible"), with the aid
of [Origen](Origen "Origen")'s *Hexapla,* and commentaries
collected by Pamphilus, in an attempt to prepare a correct
version.

In 307 Pamphilus was imprisoned, but Eusebius continued their
project. The resulting defence of Origen, in which they had
collaborated, was finished by Eusebius after the death of Pamphilus
and sent to the [martyrs](Martyr "Martyr") in the mines of Phaeno
in Egypt. Eusebius then seems to have gone to Tyre and later to
Egypt, where he first suffered persecution.

Eusebius is next heard of as [bishop](Bishop "Bishop") of Caesarea
Palaestina. He succeeded Agapius, whose time of office is not
known, but Eusebius must have become bishop soon after 313. Nothing
is known about the early years of his tenure. When the Council of
Nicaea met in 325, Eusebius was prominent in its transactions. He
was not naturally a spiritual leader or theologian, but as a very
learned man and a famous author who enjoyed the special favour of
the emperor, he came to the fore among the 300 members of the
council. The confession which he proposed became the basis of the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed").

Eusebius was involved in the further development of the
[Arian controversies](Arianism "Arianism"). For instance, in the
dispute with Eustathius of Antioch, who opposed the growing
influence of Origen and his practice of an allegorical exegesis of
scripture, seeing in his theology the roots of Arianism, Eusebius,
an admirer of Origen, was reproached by Eustathius for deviating
from the Nicene faith, and was charged in turn with
[Sabellianism](Sabellianism "Sabellianism"). Eustathius was
accused, condemned and deposed at a synod in Antioch. The people of
Antioch rebelled against this action, while the anti-Eustathians
proposed Eusebius as the new bishop, but he declined.

After Eustathius had been removed, the Eusebians proceeded against
Athanasius of Alexandria, a much more dangerous opponent. In 334
Athanasius was summoned before a synod in Caesarea; he did not
attend. In the following year he was again summoned before a synod
in Tyre at which Eusebius presided. Athanasius, foreseeing the
result, went to Constantinople to bring his cause before the
emperor. Constantine called the bishops to his court, among them
Eusebius. Athanasius was condemned and exiled at the end of 335. At
the same synod, another opponent was successfully attacked:
Marcellus of Ancyra had long opposed the Eusebians, and had
protested against the reinstitution of Arius. He was accused of
Sabellianism and deposed in 336. Constantine died the next year and
Eusebius did not long survive him. Eusebius died (probably at
Caesarea), in 340 at the latest and probably on May 30, 339.

## Works

Of the extensive literary activity of Eusebius, a relatively large
portion has been preserved. Although posterity suspected him of
Arianism, Eusebius had made himself indispensable by his method of
authorship; his comprehensive and careful excerpts from original
sources saved his successors the painstaking labor of original
research. Hence much has been preserved, quoted by Eusebius, which
otherwise would have been destroyed.

The literary productions of Eusebius reflect on the whole the
course of his life. At first he occupied himself with works on
Biblical criticism, under the influence of Pamphilus and probably
of Dorotheus of the School of Antioch. Afterward the persecutions
under Diocletian and Galerius directed his attention to the martyrs
of his own time and the past. And this led him to the history of
the whole Church and finally to the history of the world, which to
him was only a preparation for ecclesiastical history.

Then followed the time of the Arian controversies, and dogmatic
questions came into the foreground. Christianity at last found
recognition by the State; and this brought new problemsâ€”apologies
of a different sort had to be prepared. Lastly, Eusebius, the court
theologian, wrote eulogies in praise of Constantine. To all this
activity must be added numerous writings of a miscellaneous nature,
addresses, letters, and the like, and exegetical works which
include both commentaries and treatises on Biblical archeology and
extend over the whole of his life.

## The *Church History*

In his *Church History* or *Ecclesiastical History*
(*Historia Ecclesiastica*), Eusebius attempted according to his own
declaration (I.i.1) to present the history of the Church from the
apostles to his own time, with special regard to the following
points:

(1) the successions of bishops in the principal sees;
(2) the history of Christian teachers;
(3) the history of heresies;
(4) the history of the Jews;
(5) the relations to the heathen;
(6) the martyrdoms.
He grouped his material according to the reigns of the emperors,
presenting it as he found it in his sources. The contents are as
follows:

-   Book i: detailed introduction, on Jesus Christ
-   Book ii: The history of the apostolic time to the destruction
    of Jerusalem by Roman Emperor Titus
-   Book iii: The following time to Trajan
-   Books iv and v: the second century
-   Book vi: The time from Severus to Trajan Decius
-   Book vii: extends to the outbreak of the persecution under
    Diocletian
-   Book viii: more of this persecution
-   Book ix: history to Constantine's victory over Maxentius in the
    West and over Maximinus in the East
-   Book x: The reestablishment of the churches and the rebellion
    and conquest of Licinius.

In its present form the work was brought to a conclusion before the
death of Crispus (July, 326), and, since book x is dedicated to
Paulinus of Tyre who died before 325, at the end of 323 or in 324.
This work required the most comprehensive preparatory studies, and
it must have occupied him for years. His collection of martyrdoms
of the older period may have been one of these preparatory
studies.
