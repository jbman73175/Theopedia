**Eusebius of Caesarea** (ca. 265-ca.339) is known as the "father
of church history." He took part in the debates of his time,
leaning towards the [Arian](Arianism "Arianism") position regarding
the nature of the Son, [Origen](Origen "Origen")'s view on
subordination, and distrusted the teaching of
[Sabellianism](Sabellianism "Sabellianism"). After being charged
for the [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") of his Arian inclinations,
Eusebius adopted the Nicene understanding of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")
and rejected [Arius](Arius "Arius").

He was [Constantine](Constantine "Constantine")'s advisor and was
also a productive writer. His writing is considered the best source
of early Christian history, due to the information it contains on
events and people that is not recorded elsewhere.
