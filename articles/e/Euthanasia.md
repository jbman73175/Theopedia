**Euthanasia** is the act or practice of ending the life of an
individual suffering from a terminal illness or an incurable
condition, as by lethal injection or the suspension of
extraordinary medical treatment.

## Various definitions and terminology

-   Voluntary euthanasia -- When the person who is killed has
    requested to be killed.

-   Non-voluntary euthanasia -- When the person who is killed made
    no request and gave no consent.

-   Involuntary euthanasia -- When the person who is killed made an
    expressed wish to the contrary.

-   Assisted suicide -- Someone provides an individual with the
    information, guidance, and means to take his or her own life with
    the intention that they will be used for this purpose. When it is a
    doctor who helps another person to kill themselves it is called
    "physician assisted suicide."
