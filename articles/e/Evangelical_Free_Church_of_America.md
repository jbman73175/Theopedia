The **Evangelical Free Church of America** is an association of
some 1,300 autonomous churches united by a mutual commitment to
serve [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") with the guidance
of the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") and obedience to
the [Word of God](Bible "Bible"). The churches in this association
are committed to cooperate with one another in ministry and
fellowship as they seek to fulfill the
[Great Commission](Great_Commission "Great Commission") which
Christ has entrusted to His [Church](Church "Church"). The growing
ministry of the EFCA currently extends to some 45 countries of the
world.

The term *Evangelical* refers to its commitment to the proclamation
of the Gospel and to the
[authority of Scriptures](Authority_of_the_Bible "Authority of the Bible")
as being [inerrant](Inerrancy "Inerrancy") in the original writings
and the only safe and sufficient guide to faith and practice.

The term *Free* refers to its form of
[church government](Church_government "Church government") as being
[congregational](Congregational "Congregational"). Evangelical Free
Churches depend upon the active participation of lay people in the
decisions and directions.

## History

The Evangelical Free Church of America was formed in 1950 by the
merger of two church bodies: the Swedish Evangelical Free Church
and the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Free Church Association. Both
groups had been birthed in the revival movements of the late
nineteenth century.

The Swedish group had its formal beginnings in Boone, Iowa, at a
conference held in October of 1884. In that same year, two
Norwegian-Danish groups began to worship and fellowship together in
Boston, Massachusetts and Tacoma, Washington. By 1912, both the
Swedish Evangelical Free Church and the Norwegian-Danish
Evangelical Free Church Association had been formed.

Those two associations, representing 275 local congregations, were
formally joined together as they gathered for a merger conference
in June of 1950 at the Medicine Lake Conference Grounds near
Minneapolis, Minnesota. The international and national offices of
the EFCA have been located in Minneapolis since the merger took
place.

### Presidents

Dr. E.A. Halleen, who had served for 28 years as the president of
the Swedish association, was elected as the first president of the
newly formed Evangelical Free Church of America. His one-year term
crowned a brilliant ministry career as a pastor, teacher,
evangelist and church leader.

In 1951, Dr. Arnold T. Olson was elected president. He had served
as the president of the Norwegian-Danish association for six years,
as chairman of the merger committee and as the first moderator of
the EFCA. Under his leadership, The Evangelical Free Church of
America broke the boundaries of its ethnic background and flowed
into the mainstream of the
[evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical"). Dr. Olson served with
distinction as the president of the EFCA for twenty-five years.

Dr. Thomas A. McDill became the third president of the EFCA in
1976. His pastoral and administrative gifts were used by God to
significantly strengthen the church during an unsettled and
challenging time in American history. The movement grew
dramatically under his leadership both in numbers and in its
spiritual influence.

Dr. Paul A. Cedar served as the fourth president of the EFCA from
1990 until 1996. Dr. Cedar brought a passion for
[prayer](Prayer "Prayer"), spiritual dependence, and evangelism to
his leadership role. In 1996, Dr. Cedar left the EFCA to become the
first full-time president of Mission America, a national networking
and [evangelism](Evangelism "Evangelism") ministry.

Dr. William J. Hamel became the fifth president in June of 1997 and
serves currently in that role.
