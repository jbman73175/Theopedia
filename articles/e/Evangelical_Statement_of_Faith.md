A common **Evangelical Statement of Faith** is proclaimed by many
[Evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical") churches and
organizations, particularly in the United States.

## Text of the statement

Although this statement of faith varies slightly from one
institution to another, most versions resemble the following, which
is taken from the
[World Vision](http://www.worldvision.org/content.nsf/about/hr-faith?OpenDocument#faith)
website:

-   We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible,
    authoritative Word of God.
-   We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three
    persons: Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.
-   We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin
    birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and
    atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection,
    in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His
    personal return in power and glory.
-   We believe that for the salvation of lost and sinful man,
    regeneration of the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential.
-   We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose
    indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life.
-   We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost;
    they that are saved unto the resurrection of life and they that are
    lost unto the resurrection of damnation.
-   We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord
    Jesus Christ.
