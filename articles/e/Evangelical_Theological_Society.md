The **Evangelical Theological Society** (est. 1949) is an
association of Bible-believing scholars, educators, pastors, and
students in North America that meets annually for intellectual
stimulus and spiritual fellowship. The society encourages biblical
and theological research and the publication of significant
monographs, and full membership is open to anyone with a Th.M
degree or its equivalent who subscribes to the following doctrinal
basis: "The Bible alone, and the Bible in its entirety, is the Word
of God written and is therefore inerrant in the autographs. God is
a Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, each an uncreated person,
one in essence, equal in power and glory." The society publishes a
quarterly journal which contains scholarly articles and book
reviews from various evangelical perspectives.
