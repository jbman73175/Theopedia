"The term **Evangelicalism** is a wide-reaching definitional
"canopy" that covers a diverse number of
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") groups. The term originates
in the Greek word *evangelion*, meaning "the good news," or, more
commonly, the [gospel](Gospel "Gospel"). During the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation"),
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") adapted the term,
dubbing his breakaway movement the *evangelische kirke*, or
"evangelical church" -- a name still generally applied to the
[Lutheran Church](Lutheran "Lutheran") in Germany. In the
English-speaking world, however, the modern usage usually connotes
the religious movements and denominations which sprung forth from a
series of revivals that swept the North Atlantic Anglo-American
world in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries."

In this period, the
[First Great Awakening](Great_awakenings "Great awakenings") with
[Jonathan Edwards](Jonathan_Edwards "Jonathan Edwards") was deeply
influencing American religious life, while at the same time
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley"),
[George Whitefield](George_Whitefield "George Whitefield"), and the
[Methodist](Methodism "Methodism") movement were renewing British
Christianity. Much of this religious fervor was a reaction to
[Enlightenment](Enlightenment "Enlightenment") thinking and the
[deistic](Deism "Deism") writings of many of the western
philosophical elites.

In its early years, what was to become known as evangelicalism was
largely a hybrid of the [Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") emphasis on
doctrinal [orthodoxy](Orthodoxy "Orthodoxy"), and the
[pietist](Pietism "Pietism") emphasis on the heart and a "personal
relationship" with [God](God "God"). The movement saw a variety of
[liturgical](Liturgy "Liturgy") styles and ministry approaches,
though strong [preaching](Preaching "Preaching"), personal
[conversion](Conversion "Conversion"), and
[evangelism](Evangelism "Evangelism") were common features.

Not a formally organized movement, **modern evangelicals** usually
represent conservative elements from within numerous mainline
protestant denominations as well as independant
[Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") churches and [Bible](Bible "Bible")
churches. While there is no established set of beliefs which define
one as an *evangelical*, in general, evangelicals hold to:

-   an orthodox [Christology](Christology "Christology") and
    emphasis on Christ's [atoning work](Atonement "Atonement") and
    bodily [Resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection");
-   the belief that [salvation](Salvation "Salvation") is the
    result of God's grace through Christ rather than any human works;
-   the
    [authority](Authority_of_the_Bible "Authority of the Bible") and
    [inspiration](Inspiration_of_the_Bible "Inspiration of the Bible")
    of [Scripture](Bible "Bible"), usually holding to the
    [inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy") of the original autographs;
-   an emphasis on biblical [preaching](Preaching "Preaching") and
    teaching;
-   an emphasis on the [conversion](Conversion "Conversion")
    experience, typically referred to as being "*born again*" or
    experiencing a "*new birth*";
-   and an emphasis on [evangelism](Evangelism "Evangelism") and
    the importance of [mission work](Missiology "Missiology").

Evangelicals who are part of various traditions of Christian
thought ([Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"),
[Methodism](Methodism "Methodism"),
[Lutheranism](Lutheran "Lutheran"),
[Baptists](Baptists "Baptists"), etc.) may also emphasize other
doctrinal stances important to their own traditions, but all
typically agree with the above listed items.

Evangelicals consider *evangelicalism* as an emphasis on reviving
the true historic faith of the [Church](Church "Church") and the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"). They do not consider their positions to be
innovative or new.

## Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism

The Christian [fundamentalist](Fundamentalism "Fundamentalism")
"movement" is usually seen as the late 19th - early 20th century
reaction to [liberalism](Liberalism "Liberalism") among
conservative evangelicals, which some term the
Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy. The movement inherited its
name from *[The Fundamentals](The_Fundamentals "The Fundamentals")*
(1910-1915), a twelve-volume set of essays designed to combat
[Liberal theology](Liberalism "Liberalism") -- 94 essays by 64
British and American conservative Protestant theologians.

However, a growing element of the movement during the early-to-mid
1900s became more separatist in nature and more characteristically
dispensational in its theology. As
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") and
separatism began to overwhelmingly characterize the most popular
"fundamentalist" leaders, other "evangelicals" began to distance
themselves from this brand of fundamentalism.

This led to what some have termed the
**Evangelical-Fundamentalist break-up** in the mid
1900s.^[[2]](#note-1)^ The movement broke up along very definable
lines within conservative Evangelical Protestantism as issues
progressed.
[Neo-evangelicalism](Neo-evangelicalism "Neo-evangelicalism"), as
well as Reformed and Lutheran Confessionalism among others, began
to developed distinct identities within evangelicalism and none of
them acknowledge any more than an historical overlap with the
Fundamentalist Movement. They are fundamentalists in a broad sense,
but they sought to distance themselves form the cultural separatism
which was increasingly identified with "fundamentalism." Hence,
they no longer referred to themselves as fundamentalists. In
contrast, today's Fundamentalists look to the earlier
Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy for its identity and as its
primary historical point of reference.

Consequently, many Evangelical groups may be described as
"fundamentalist" in the broad sense, who do not belong in the
"Fundamentalist movement" in the narrow sense. Many Evangelicals
continue to hold the doctrine of Biblical
[inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy"), a basic issue of difference in
the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy a century ago. The
[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy](Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy "Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy"),
for instance, was signed in 1978 by nearly 300 conservative
scholars, including
[James Boice](James_Montgomery_Boice "James Montgomery Boice"),
[Norman Geisler](Norman_Geisler "Norman Geisler"),
[John Gerstner](John_Gerstner "John Gerstner"),
[Carl F. H. Henry](Carl_F._H._Henry "Carl F. H. Henry") (founder of
Christianity Today), Kenneth Kantzer, Harold Lindsell, John Warwick
Montgomery, [Roger Nicole](Roger_Nicole "Roger Nicole"),
[J. I. Packer](J._I._Packer "J. I. Packer"), Robert Preus, Earl
Radmacher,
[Francis Schaeffer](Francis_Schaeffer "Francis Schaeffer"),
[R. C. Sproul](R._C._Sproul "R. C. Sproul"), and John Wenham. Very
few if any of these men fit the definition of or identify
themselves with today's Fundamentalists.
