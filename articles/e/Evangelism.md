**Evangelism** is "the proclamation of
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") in [Christ](Jesus "Jesus") to
those who do not believe in him, calling them to
[repentance](Repentance "Repentance") and
[conversion](Conversion "Conversion"), announcing
[forgiveness](Forgiveness "Forgiveness") of [sin](Sin "Sin"), and
inviting them to become living members of Christ's earthly
community and to begin a life of service to others in the power of
the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit")" (Bosch 1991, 10-11).

Some distinguish evangelism from [missions](Missions "Missions"),
associating evangelism with the personal aspect of sharing Christ,
and missions the global aspect.

## Types

### E-1

"E-1 Evangelism is monocultural. It is the shorthand term that
refers to winning those of your own culture to Jesus Christ and
assumes that they will feel at home in your own kind of local
church. It includes both expansion and extension growth."
[[1]](http://gcuc.ncf.ca/evang.html)

### E-2 and E-3

"Both E-2 and E-3 are cross-cultural. They are actually
subdivisions of bridging growth. E-2 is evangelization in cultures
different from the culture of the evangelist, but only slightly
different. E-3 is evangelism in vastly different cultures. The
difference between the two is in degree, not in kind, since they
both involve starting churches in different cultures. Note that
geographical distances have nothing to do with this. People at an
E-3 distance can often be found in the same city."
[[2]](http://gcuc.ncf.ca/evang.html)

### E-0

"To complete the picture, E-0 evangelism means winning people to
Christ who are already church members. Some churches in [North]
America have large members who are not born again or committed to
Christ, people who obviously need to be evangelized."
[[3]](http://gcuc.ncf.ca/evang.html)

## Styles

### Initiative/active evangelism

##### Tracting

Tracts are a great resource for evangelism. They are able to speak
when one is absent, be where one is not, and even communicate the
message people sometimes have trouble articulating.
[God](God "God") can use tracts to reach people, but it takes
someone to distribute them. Even the most shy and inexperienced
Christian can sow more seeds for the Gospel in an hour using tracts
than many churches do in a year. With American society growing ever
more face-paced and less personal, tracts offer the seed-sower a
unique opportunity to share the gospel in a medium that has been
proven effective.

##### Open air preaching

Open Air Preaching is a powerful tool used by
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"), [Peter](Peter "Peter"), [Paul](Paul "Paul")
and many other Christians down through the ages. It is the
presentation of the Gospel to a group of people. A form of open air
preaching is street preaching. Many famous sermons were given out
of doors including the
[Sermon on the Mount](Sermon_on_the_Mount "Sermon on the Mount") as
well as much of the
[great awakening](Great_Awakening "Great Awakening") preaching.
Futhermore, many [Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") reformers
preached in forests away from the cities in order to avoid
persecution.

### Relational evangelism

#### Life-style evangelism

There are two distinct views on life-style evangelism. The first is
popularly phrased by Francis of Assisi who said, "Preach the Gospel
at all times and when necessary use words." The idea behind this
style of evangelism is to live the Christian walk with the hope
that people will see Christ through your actions.

The second view of life-style evangelism is to make sharing the
Gospel a life style. Those that follow this second view contend
that actions are important and indeed necessary, but to think that
one can live a life so holy that the world will see Christ in you
and then fall over converted is sometimes seen as arrogant. If the
most holy [Man](Jesus "Jesus") who ever lived had to fill the
scriptures with red text, why do we think we can share without
words? This view is best phrased by evangelist Mark Cahill who
said, "Preach the Gospel at all times and when necessary use
actions."

The goal for the balanced Christian is to share the Gospel through
both actions *and* words. Believers should not use their holiness
as an excuse not to explain the Gospel verbally. Nor should they
vocally share their faith and then discredit their words with their
actions or lack thereof.
