**Evelyn Stagg**, *née* **Evelyn Owen** (born 1914), is an
authority on classical studies, which led to her extensive research
on the cultural/historical status and treatment of women in the
ancient world, and in the world into which Jesus was born.

She is co-author of the book
*[Woman in the World of Jesus](Woman_in_the_World_of_Jesus_(book) "Woman in the World of Jesus (book)"),*^[[1]](#note-0)^
which purports to explain woman's role in the church today by
explaining:

-   the status of woman in the world Jesus entered
-   the position of Jesus with respect to women
-   the status of woman in the church as reflected in the
    [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament").

Married to eminent [Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") theologian
[Dr. Frank Stagg](Frank_Stagg "Frank Stagg"), she is a native of
Louisiana. Their three adult children are Ted, Bob, and Ginger. As
a young woman, Evelyn wanted to pursue a seminary degree. However,
in her denomination women could not attend seminary and could not
hold the title of minister and be ordained. When husband Frank was
in the seminary in the 1930s, Evelyn was permitted to sit in some
theology courses and take the exams, but not receive credit. Sarah
Frances Anders wrote that the course report would list the men by
name and add that "one unnamed woman" made one of the few
A's.^[[2]](#note-1)^
