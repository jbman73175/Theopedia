**Every Nation Church Crisis**

During 2003 former and current members of Morningstar International
Church (MSI), His People (HP) and Maranatha Campus Ministries (MCM)
began to increasingly discuss their concerns about the organisation
known as Morningstar International Inc. group of churches and
ministries. The Internet proved to be an ideal platform to network,
compare notes and to encourage others and come forward and share
their experiences and insights.

MSI became Every Nation Churches and Ministries in 2004 (EN).
Previously, former members and visitors comments had been ad hoc
and mainly been limited to email exchanges with other members, MSI
leaders and including former members of Maranatha Campus Ministries
(MCM), which disbanded in 1990.

**These concerns included:**

\1. Entrenched authoritarianism and a wandering away from Biblical
 standards of ministry

\2. Financial Mismanagement

\3. The dismissal of various senior leaders from the organisation.

\4. Doctrine

\5. Historical problems and issues as recognised in MCM.

There are a variety of opinions amongst critics regarding the
future of EN:

\1. EN should be disbanded as with MCM

\2. Members should be encouraged to leave ASAP

\3. Information needs to be disseminated and people should make up
 their own minds

Critical debate regarding EN has up to now been stifled or
controlled by EN leadership whenever raised internally. Many
members have raised their suspicions regarding communication etc.
in light of recent developments, trends and purported reforms etc.
