**Evolution** is a naturalistic theory of the origins of life,
attempting to explain the existence of life without invoking God.
It holds that all forms of life are descended from one "simple"
organism, which must have formed itself from non-living chemicals.
In order for all life to be descended from such an organism, there
must be a process by which new information can be added to its
genome. According to the theory of evolution, genetic mutations,
which are sorted by natural selection, increase genetic
information, thus producing increasingly complex forms of
life.^[[1]](#note-0)^ The theory was first proposed by Charles
Darwin in his 1859 book
*On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life*.

## Natural Selection

Natural selection is the process by which the genetic traits of an
organism that help it to survive in a particular environment become
more common in a population, because organisms without those traits
would be less likely to survive and reproduce than those with the
beneficial traits.^[[2]](#note-1)^ Natural selection, combined with
genetic mutations, is what is often cited as "proof" of evolution,
despite neither being able to increase information in the
genome.^[[3]](#note-2)^ Both of these processes can only ever
*shuffle*, or *delete* genetic information, making an organism more
specialized to its environment, and can *never* cause an increase
in information in the genome.^[[4]](#note-3)^^[[5]](#note-4)^

## Mutations

Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome, which
are caused by radiation, viruses, transposons^[[6]](#note-5)^ and
mutagenic chemicals^[[7]](#note-6)^, as well as errors that occur
during meiosis^[[8]](#note-7)^ or DNA
replication.^[[9]](#note-8)^^[[10]](#note-9)^^[[11]](#note-10)^
Whilst they can form new alleles, mutations *cannot* increase the
amount of information in the genome.^[[12]](#note-11)^

## Scripture

An honest reading of Scripture shows that God created life in six
regular, 24 hour days days^[[13]](#note-12)^. Calculations from the
chronogenealogies of Genesis 5 and 11 show that Adam was created in
about 4000 BC.^[[14]](#note-13)^ This totally contradicts the
theory of evolution, which holds that life essentially created
itself, billions of years ago.
