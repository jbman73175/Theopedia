**Exclusivism** (in Christianity) refers to the fact that orthodox
Christian doctrine maintains only faith in the Jesus Christ of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") leads to [salvation](Salvation "Salvation")
or [heaven](Heaven "Heaven"). Christianity is exclusive in that its
teachings indicate that the faith of other sects or religions will
not lead to [eternal life](Eternal_life "Eternal life"); or in
other words, that [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") is
the only true way to God. This is contrary to today's pluralistic
environment, which would suggest that, as in the old saying "all
roads lead to Rome", so all faiths indeed lead to God.

## History of the doctrine

"Exclusivism has been the historic position of much of the
church..."
-[Daniel B. Clendenin](http://www.christourshepherd.org/DiscipleshipArticles/September/Way.htm)

## What about those who never hear?

Regarding the question of those who may never hear the Christian
gospel, [R.C. Sproul](R.C._Sproul "R.C. Sproul") has said, "If a
person in a remote area has never heard of Christ, he will not be
punished for that. What he will be punished for is the rejection of
the Father of whom he has heard and for the disobedience to the law
that is written in his heart."

## Engaged exclusivism

## Arguments

### The post-resurrection role of the Holy Spirit

"John tells us that the Holy Spirit is sent by the Father and by
the Son in the name of the Son and that He does whatever He is told
to do and says whatever He is told to say. In this way, the Holy
Spirit acts as a sort of ambassador for the King and His Son. He is
co-equal with these Regents, but His role is to work in the world.
And as an ambassador, it is His job to point back to Those to whom
He is sent, namely the Father and Son."
