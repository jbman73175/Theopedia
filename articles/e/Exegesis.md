Biblical **exegesis** is a systematic process by which a person
arrives at a reasonable and coherent sense of the meaning and
message of a biblical passage. Ideally, an understanding of the
original texts ([Greek](Greek "Greek") and Hebrew) is required. In
the process of exegesis, a passage must be viewed in its historical
and grammatical context with its time/purpose of writing taken into
account. This is often accomodated by asking:

-   Who wrote the text, and who is the intended readership?
-   What is the context of the text, i.e. how does it fit in the
    author's larger thought process, purpose, or argument in the
    chapter and book where it resides?
-   Is the choice of words, wording, or word order significant in
    this particular passage?
-   Why was the text written (e.g. to correct, encourage, or
    explain, etc.)?
-   When was the text written?

## Distinct from hermeneutics

Sometimes the terms exegesis and
[hermeneutics](Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics") have been used
interchangeably. However, there is a distinction to be made.
[Bernard Ramm](Bernard_Ramm "Bernard Ramm") describes the
difference as follows:

"Hermeneutics . . . stands in the same relationship to exegesis
that a rule-book stands to a game. . . . The rules are not the
game, and the game is meaningless without the rules. Hermeneutics
proper is not exegesis, but exegesis is applied
hermeneutics."^[[1]](#note-0)^
In this sense, hermeneutics may also be seen as the "method of
exegesis."
