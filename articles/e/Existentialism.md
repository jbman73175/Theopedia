**Existentialism** is "the philosophical theory which holds that a
further set of categories, governed by the norm of *authenticity*,
is necessary to grasp human existence."
[[1]](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/) In other
words, existentialism deals with human existence. It is considered
more "a movement of the past", but is also considered an attitude
of one's thought. Existentialism has had a profound affect on
[philosophy](Philosophy "Philosophy") and
[theology](Theology "Theology") over the last 50 years.

The first philosopher to use the term was
[Soren Kierkegaard](Soren_Kierkegaard "Soren Kierkegaard") (1813 -
1855), commonly called the "father of existentialism", although the
term was explicitly adopted as a self-description by Jean-Paul
Sartre. [[2]](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/)

Existentialism has also been recognized by it's slogan, " Existence
precedes Essence." This means that we have no predetermined nature
or essence that controls what we are, what we do, or what is
valuable for us. Further, we are radically free to act
independently of determination by outside influences. We create our
own human nature through these free choices, and we also create our
values through these choices.

## Precursors of existentialism

-   [Soren Kierkegaard](Soren_Kierkegaard "Soren Kierkegaard") -
    Kierkegaard died too soon to be a part of the existentialist
    movement, and would have rejected many tenets of Sartre's
    existentialism. Yet, he was one of the first philosophers dealing
    with the problems of human existence in ways recognizable as
    forerunners of Sartrean existentialism.
-   [Friedrich Nietzche](Friedrich_Nietzche "Friedrich Nietzche") -
    Like Kierkegaard, Nietzche died too soon to be part of the
    existentialist movement, and, in many ways differs from the
    existentialism we know. Yet, his work is precursor to many of the
    developments in later existentialist thought.
-   [Martin Heidegger](index.php?title=Martin_Heidegger&action=edit&redlink=1 "Martin Heidegger (page does not exist)")

## Existentialist theologians

-   [Rudolf Bultmann](Rudolf_Bultmann "Rudolf Bultmann")
-   [Paul Tillich](Paul_Tillich "Paul Tillich")
-   [Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth") (this is debatable)
