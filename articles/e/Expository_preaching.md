**Expository preaching** is a kind of preaching that expounds upon
the meaning of a particular text or passage of Scripture.

"One defining characteristic of expository preaching is that it
does not dwell on non-biblical examples. It does not focus on
stories, jokes and anecdotes. Instead, it seeks to stay focused on
the text in question." -Tim Challies

## Quotes

-   "One advantage in preaching through a book of the Bibleâ€¦ is
    that it compels us to face every single statement, come what may,
    and stand before it, and look at it, and allow it to speak to us.
    Indeed it is interesting to observe that not infrequently certain
    well-known Bible teachers never face certain Epistles at all in
    their expositions because there are difficulties which they are
    resolved to avoid." -Martyn Lloyd Jones
