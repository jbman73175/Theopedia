**Ezra** was a [priest](Priest "Priest"),
[scribe](index.php?title=Scribe&action=edit&redlink=1 "Scribe (page does not exist)")
and religious reformer who led a group of exiles back to
[Jerusalem](Jerusalem "Jerusalem") in 458BCE during the reign of
Artaxerxes I. His name means ‘God Helps.’ Ezra is the son of
Seraiah, a
[High Priest](index.php?title=High_Priest&action=edit&redlink=1 "High Priest (page does not exist)")
who was taken captive by the Babylonians.

Ezra is mentioned in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah in the word of
God. The Bible describes him as a “scribe skilled in the law of
Moses” (Ezra 7:6).

Through the hand of God Ezra was able to secure permission from the
king to return back to Jerusalem with any of the Israelites,
priests or Levites who were willing to go back. The king offered a
significant amount of gold, silver and provisions for the temple of
God and extended all support for this task. Ezra was given
authority to ensure that the worship and sacrifices take place in
the temple of God in Jerusalmen, to appoint judges to administer
justice to the people, and to teach the Law of God to those who do
not know it. Ezra was given the authority to punish any
disobedience to the Law of God either by death, banishment,
property confiscation and imprisonment.

Ezra was able to gather a number of exiles to return with him. He
started his journey on the first day of the first month (Nisan,
which is April) and reached Jerusalem traveling via the ford of
Euphrates at Carchemish on the first day of the fifth month (Ab,
which is August)—a journey of nearly nine hundred miles, taking
four months.

He assembled all the people at the River Ahava. On checking the
people he could not find Levites among them and then summoned
certain leaders and sent them to Iddo the leader in Casiphia who
sent him 38 Levites. At the River Ahava Ezra proclaimed a fast so
that they may humble themselves before God and to ask for
protection during their journey back. He was not willing to ask the
king for soldiers to protect them. Ezra appointed 12 leading
priests and 12 Levites to be in charge of all the gold, silver and
other articles given by the king, his advisers and other people for
the temple of God. There were 25 tons of silver, 3.75 tons of
silver articles, 3.75 tons of gold, 20 bowls of gold, and 2
articles of very precious bronze. They then started on their
journey from Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month (Nisan).

On reaching Jerusalem, they rested for three days and on the fourth
day weighed out the gold and silver into the hand of the priests,
and the total weights were recorded.

Ezra came to know through the leaders that the Jewish people living
in the land have not been faithful to the covenant of separation
from the Gentiles that God told them to have and had intermarried
with the Gentiles. They were also following their detestable
practices. Ezra was heart-broken at the state of affairs and tore
his clothes in sorrow and prayed to God for forgiveness. He was
praying, confessing, and weeping before the house of God. A large
crowd of Israelites gathered there and confessing their failure to
adhere to the Law of God, decided to send away their foreign wives
and children. They encouraged Ezra to implement this decision
throughout the land.
