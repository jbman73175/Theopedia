F. B. Meyer, c. 1899
**Frederick Brotherton Meyer** (1847-1929) born in London, was a
[Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") pastor and evangelist in England. He
attended Brighton College and graduated from London University in
1869. He studied theology at Regents Park Baptist College.

Meyer began a lenghty pastoring ministry in 1870. His first
pastorate was at Pembroke Baptist Chapel in Liverpool. In 1872 he
pastored Priory Street Baptist Church in York. While he was there
he met the American evangelist
[Dwight L. Moody](Dwight_L._Moody "Dwight L. Moody"), whom he
introduced to other churches in England. The two preachers became
lifelong friends.

His evangelistic tours included South Africa and Asia. He also
visited the United States and Canada on a number of occasions.
Meyer was part of the "Higher Life movement" and preached often at
the Keswick Convention. He was known as a crusader against
immorality.

Meyer wrote over 40 books, including Christian biographies and
devotional commentaries on the [Bible](Bible "Bible").
