"Now **faith** is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction
of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1). This passage is considered one
of the most concise definitions of faith given in the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"). Faith is synonymous with belief, and both
are translated from the same [Greek](Greek "Greek") word
^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#4102](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=4102&version=nas)]*^
in the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament").

Many theologians, especially from Reformed backgrounds, argue that
true saving faith as described in the Bible must include not only
mental *knowledge* and *assent* but the vital aspect of *trust*.
This idea is found in the
[Westminster Confession of Faith](Westminster_Confession_of_Faith "Westminster Confession of Faith")
in the phrase "But the principal acts of saving faith are
*accepting*, *receiving*, and *resting* upon Christ alone for
justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the
covenant of grace," (WCF 14.2).

## Faith and justification

The Bibles teaches that people are "justified by faith apart from
works of the law" (Romans 3:28). [Paul](Paul "Paul"), the author of
this letter, appealed to the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") for this view: "The
righteous shall live by faith" (Habakkuk 2:4). In Paul's mind this
faith is a living faith that "work[s] through love" (Galatians
5:6), yet is distinct from works: "And to the one who does not work
but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as
righteousness" (Romans 4:5). This is the faith that alone justifies
a person, so that [God](God "God") gets the credit and glory for
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation"), so that there is no boasting,
and so that the only righteousness on display is the righteousness
of Christ. We are justified neither by love, nor by the fruits of
faith, but by faith alone.

A very clear, recurring theme in the
[Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") is belief:
"Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not
obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on
him" (John 3:36). "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my
word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not
come into judgment, but has passed from death to life" (John
5:24).

## Faith without works

The [Apostle Paul](Apostle_Paul "Apostle Paul") also had a category
for dead or vain faith:

"Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you,
which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being
saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you - unless you
believed in vain" (1 Corinthians 15:1-2).
This is the same category that is generally considered to be what
James had in mind when he speaks of "faith" in
[James 2](James_2 "James 2")--a dead, hypocritical faith, which was
not accompanied by the fruits and evidences of works:

"What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but
does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or
sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you
says to them, 'Go in peace, be warmed and filled,' without giving
them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also
faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone
will say, 'You have faith and I have works.' Show me your faith
apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe -
and shudder! Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that
faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father
justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?
You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was
completed by his works; and the Scripture was fulfilled that says,
'Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness'
- and he was called a friend of God. You see that a person is
justified by works and not by faith alone" (James 2:14-24).
While the [Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") is
abundantly clear that "whoever believes in him should not perish
but have eternal life" (John 3:16), one of the reoccuring themes in
the gospel is also a vain faith that is too dependent on seeing
signs: "Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many
believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing. But
Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew
all people and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he
himself knew what was in man" (John 2:23-25).

## Saving faith, a gift from God

Saving faith is treated in several places of the New Testament as a
gift of God. This means that apart from God giving faith, no man
would ever place their faith in Christ. The reason that they will
not place their faith in Christ is not because God is hindering
them, but because their sinful, depraved heart rejects Christ (Jer.
17:9). Not only is grace freely received by faith, faith also is a
gift itself, given from God so that we cannot take credit for
anything. Faith is a product of God's workmanship.

-   "For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you
    should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake."
    (Philippians 1:29)
-   "And he said, 'This is why I told you that no one can come to
    me unless it is granted him by the Father.'" (John 6:65)
-   "And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brothers encouraged
    him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he
    greatly helped those who through grace had believed," (Acts 18:27)

## Faith in the Christian life

God has "assigned" every Christian a "measure of faith" associated
with various spiritual gifts, variously designed to contribute to
the body of Christ, therefore we ought not to think of ourselves
too highly:

"For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to
think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think
with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that
God has assigned. For as in one body we have many members, and the
members do not all have the same function, so we, though many, are
one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. Having
gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use
them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; if service, in our
serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching; the one who exhorts,
in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one
who leads, with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with
cheerfulness" (Romans 12:3-8).

## Faith and spiritual sight

Faith is sometimes equated with a looking to Christ, or a spiritual
sight and rapt, heart-focus on his glory. In John 3, believing in
Christ is synonymous with looking at the Son of Man lifted up, just
as the serpent was lifted up in the wilderness by Moses:

"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the
Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him may have
eternal life" (John 3:14-15).
