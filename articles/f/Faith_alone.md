**By faith alone**, from the Latin **Sola Fide**, is one of the
[five Solas](Five_Solas "Five Solas") of the 16th century
Protestant Reformation. This was
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther")'s cry in reference
to [Justification](Justification "Justification"), our
"right-standing" before God. Justification, he declared, is by
faith alone, not faith plus anything else. Luther believed this was
a critical doctrine and regarded it as the truth by which the
church would either stand or fall.

## Rooted in "sola gratia"

"The doctrine of free justification by faith alone, which became
the storm center of so much controversy during the Reformation
period, is so often regarded as the heart of the Reformers’
theology but this is not accurate. The truth is that their thinking
was really centered upon the contention of Paul, echoed by
Augustine and others, that the sinner’s entire salvation is by free
and sovereign grace only, and that the doctrine of justification by
faith was important to them because it safeguarded the principle of
sovereign grace. The sovereignty of grace found expression in their
thinking at a more profound level still in the doctrine of
monergistic regeneration." -
