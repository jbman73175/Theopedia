"A limestone ossuary found more than 25 years ago in a 2,000
year-old tomb in Jerusalem, that may have held the remains of Mary
Magdalene, is displayed to the media during a news conference in

The **Family Tomb of Jesus story** concerns the controversal claim
of Simcha Jacobovici and Charles R. Pellegrino that the Talpiot
Tomb is the tomb of Jesus Christ and his family.

## What are the basic history problems?

"The historical problems with all this are too numerous to list
here: A) the ancestral home of Joseph was Bethlehem, and his adult
home was Nazareth. The family was still in Nazareth after he was
apparently dead and gone. Why in the world would be be buried
(alone at this point) in Jerusalem? It’s unlikely. B) One of the
ossuaries has the name Jude son of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). We have
no historical evidence of such a son of Jesus, indeed we have no
historical evidence he was ever married; C) the Mary ossuaries
(there are two) do not mention anyone from Migdal. It simply has
the name Mary-- and that's about the most common of all ancient
Jewish female names. D) we have names like
[Matthew](Matthew "Matthew") on another ossuary, which don't match
up with the list of brothers' names. E) By all ancient accounts,
the tomb of Jesus was empty-- even the Jewish and Roman authorities
acknowledged this. Now it takes a year for the flesh to desiccate,
and then you put the man's bones in an ossuary. But Jesus' body was
long gone from Joseph of Arimathea's tomb well before then. Are we
really to believe it was moved to another tomb, decayed, and then
was put in an ossuary? Its not likely. F) Implicitly you must
accuse James, [Peter](Peter "Peter") and John (mentioned in Gal.
1-2-- in our earliest NT document from 49 A.D.) of fraud and
coverup. Are we really to believe that they knew Jesus didn't rise
bodily from the dead but perpetrated a fraudulent religion, for
which they and others were prepared to die? Did they really hide
the body of Jesus in another tomb? We need to remember that the
James in question is Jesus' brother, who certainly would have known
about a family tomb. This frankly is impossible for me to
believe."^[[1]](#note-0)^
## Is "Mariamne" Mary Magdalene?

"[S]ince the identification of 'Mariamne' as
[Mary Magdalene](Mary_Magdalene "Mary Magdalene") is central to the
entire theory, don't you find it rather odd that Jacobovici and his
team overlooked the prevalence of the name and the source of it
(Mariamne was the favorite wife of Herod--how many baby girls were
named "Jackie" back in the 1960s?) in the contemporary records
while running to a document written 1) at least three centuries
later, probably four, 2) known in full only from a 14th century
translation, 3) in a different language than that relevant to the
ossuaries, 4) from a geographical location far removed from
Jerusalem, 5) that itself never identifies Mariamne as Mary
Magdalene (that is pure speculation on the part of Francois Bovon)
and 6) that is utterly a-historical and mythical? Is this really
how you do serious 'investigation' and
scholarship?"^[[2]](#note-1)^
## What about the statistics?

[James White](James_White "James White") writes:

"At least 20 men would, using the same statistics, have lived in
Jerusalem during that time period that had a father named Joseph
and a brother named James. And guess what? All twenty or more of
them died. And were buried. How many had ossuaries? Hard to say. We
have found multiple attestations of the name Jesus in ossuaries
from the time. The Talpiot tomb is nothing new. But Jesus wasn't
from Jerusalem. He did not live there, nor would there be any
reason to think that a multi-generational tomb would be owned there
by someone from Nazareth which is far to the north of Jerusalem.
But beyond the fact that it is truly stretching it to assert that a
poor man from Nazareth would have a rich tomb in Jerusalem...where
he was crucified...and where his followers were persecuted by the
Jewish leaders...who would have made the tomb the main-stay of
their apologetic arguments against the growing Christian faith
(nothing like showing off Jesus' tomb to end rumors of
resurrection!), the fact is that the odds are high against any
particular combination of names appearing in a single tomb in any
one place."^[[3]](#note-2)^
## What does the DNA show?

"The mitochondrial DNA evidence... conclusively proves that the
tiny bone fragments recovered from ossuaries 80-500 and 80-503 came
from people who were not related to one another maternally. Nothing
more. They could have been related paternally, i.e., 80-503 could
have been the father of 80-500 but the DNA evidence currently
available cannot say much more than that. Finding people in a
family tomb who are not maternally related is, of course, not
unusual. In fact, it is normal. The assumption that Yeshua ben
Yosef, if that inscription is being read correctly at all, was
married to at least one of those whose bones were placed in ossuary
80-500 (there could have been more than one), is fanciful at best.
Tell me, why do you think the authors of the book forgot to tell
their readers about the paternal possibilities of relationship
between these two ossuaries? Is it because that reality is fatal to
the case they are trying to construct?"^[[4]](#note-3)^
## Does John 19 describe a conversation between Jesus and his wife?

"The unique theory presented in the show is that John 19 presents a
conversation between Jesus on the cross and his wife Mary
Magdalene, with their son being the Beloved Disciple! The problem
of course with this is that Jesus is addressing his own mother,
Mary. John 19.26 is quite clear--- Jesus saw his mother standing
there, and spoke to her about the Beloved Disciple, who is
certainly not his son. In John 13 and following the Beloved
Disciple is portrayed as one of the adult disciples in the upper
room. Not as a child. Here is but one more example of how normal
interpretations of the Biblical evidence are ignored and rejected
in favor of rewriting the text to support the theory, and much
later non-eyewitness Gnostic evidence from the Acts of Philip is
made crucial to the case, even when that evidence itself does not
likely support the case at all!"^[[5]](#note-4)^
## Was the Gospel of Thomas written by "Jesus' son Judah"?

"[T]he Gospel of Thomas was written far, far from Jerusalem, in a
different language, and it comes from a completely different
worldview. Those who are not invested in selling books promoting
the Gospel of Thomas recognize that it was written no earlier than
about AD 165. So, if Judah was buried around AD 65, it was quite
the trick for him to write a book a hundred years after he was
buried, in a land far away, in a language he would have no reason
to speak!"^[[6]](#note-5)^
## Tenth ossuary missing?

"[T]he makers of this film and book were told that the tenth
ossuary found in the Talpiot tomb was not missing. It was a blank,
having neither ornamentation nor inscription, and so it was not
catalogued with the other nine. However, on the show, mystery is
concocted when the list of the nine catalogued ossuaries is
presented and it is concluded one is missing, which is false." -
