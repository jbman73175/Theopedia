The **Federal Vision** (hereafter FV) is the view that seeks a
restatement of traditional
[Reformed theology](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology") in order
to apply a more robust
[Covenant theology](Covenant_theology "Covenant theology") in the
study of the relationship between
[obedience](index.php?title=Obedience&action=edit&redlink=1 "Obedience (page does not exist)")
and [faith](Faith "Faith"), and the role of the
[Church](Church "Church") and [Sacrament](Sacrament "Sacrament") in
one's [salvation](Salvation "Salvation"). Proponents are made up of
a loosely organized but vocal group of writers among the
confessional [Reformed](Reformed_churches "Reformed churches") and
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") churches who appear
intent on revising core confessional
[doctrines](Doctrine "Doctrine") such as
[election](Election "Election"),
[covenant](Covenant_Theology "Covenant Theology"), the
[sacraments](Sacraments "Sacraments"), and
[justification](Justification "Justification").

FV proponents claim to be addressing problems in the contemporary
evangelical and Reformed churches such as individualism, the
neglect of the covenantal objectivity of salvation, an
over-emphasized subjectivity in seeking assurance of salvation,
[antinomianism](Antinomianism "Antinomianism"), and an inadequate
view of the role of the sacraments as signs and seals of
salvation.

Critics see the pastoral concern in these matters as commendable,
but contend that the FV re-casting of the
[orthodox](Orthodox "Orthodox") understanding of certain vital
aspects of biblical and Reformed theology (cf. the
[Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession"))
raises far more serious problems than the ones which FV proponents
claim to solve.

## Background

According to Dr. R. Scott Clark, the current Federal Vision
theology is based on the 1974 views of Norman Shepherd, then
teaching systematic theology at Westminster Seminary
(Philadelphia), which essentially revised the doctrines of Covenant
and Justification. He notes that Shepherd's teaching along with
some elements from the the
[New Perspective on Paul](New_Perspective_on_Paul "New Perspective on Paul")
"converged in a series of conferences at Auburn Avenue Church and
they gave themselves the name: The Federal Vision."
[[1]](http://www.wscal.edu/clark/tuning.php)

Early in 2002, Auburn Avenue Presbyterian Church (PCA) held a
pastor's conference entitled "Federal Vision" that became
controversial especially in the PCA and OPC denominations. The
primary conference speakers were Steve Wilkins, John Barach, Steve
Schlissel, and Doug Wilson whose lectures articulated what they
themselves called a new paradigm in theology. The main theme of the
conference centered on a new way to view the covenant which they
referred to as "the objectivity of the covenant."

Some claimed that what was taught at the conference compromised the
Reformed doctrine regarding justification by faith alone, the
covenants, election, perseverance, and the sacraments. Later in
2002, the Reformed Presbyterian Church of the United States issued
an official condemnation of some of the themes of the conference
and what it perceived to be implications of those themes, accusing
the speakers of undermining the Westminster Standards and the
Reformed faith. The issue of "Federal Vision" theology has since
become an intense controversy among Presbyterians in particular.

Subsequently, a special colloquium was called in Southern Florida
during August 2003, hosted by Dr. E. Calvin Beisner. Papers were
exchanged and discussed, by seven of the Federal Vision proponents
and by seven of its critics. The former were John Barach, Peter J.
Leithart, Rick Lusk, Steve M. Schlissel, Tom Trouwborst, Steve
Wilkins, and Douglas Wilson. The critics of the Federal Vision were
Christopher A. Hutchinson, George W. Knight, III, Richard D.
Phillips, Joseph A. Pipa, Jr., Carl D. Robbins, Morton H. Smith;
and R. Fowler White. The collection of papers was published as
*Auburn Avenue Theology, Pros and Cons: Debating the Federal Vision*
(Dr. E. Calvin Beisner, editor) and has provided a basis for
continued debate.

"Today the FV movement has been rejected by several of the major
denominations in the North American Presbyterian and Reformed
Council (NAPARC). Among those denominations that have rejected the
FV: The Presbyterian Church in America, the Orthodox Presbyterian
Church, the United Reformed Churches, the Reformed Church in the U.
S., and the Orthodox Christian Reformed Churches. . . Since most of
the NAPARC churches have rejected the FV, the principal
ecclesiastical home of the FV movement has become a group called
the Confederation of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC). . . The
CREC is not recognized by NAPARC as a Reformed denomination and is
not in formal ecclesiastical fellowship with the OPC, the URCs, the
PCA, or the RCUS." [[2]](http://www.wscal.edu/clark/tuning.php)

## Areas of concern

-   The Federal Vision introduces different views of
    [covenant](Covenant "Covenant"), [faith](Faith "Faith"),
    [baptism](Baptism "Baptism"), the
    [Lord's Supper](Lord's_Supper "Lord's Supper"),
    [election](Election "Election"),
    [regeneration](Regeneration "Regeneration"),
    [apostasy](Apostasy "Apostasy"), and
    [sacramental](Sacraments "Sacraments") efficacy. While it is
    claimed that all these re-formulations are within the parameters of
    the orthodox Reformed Faith, critics claim that the Federal Vision
    is, in the end, contrary to the Westminster Standards.

-   Critics see in the FV a loss of biblical balance regarding
    [covenant theology](Covenant_theology "Covenant theology"). Union
    with the (visible) church automatically implies union with Christ
    in the Federal Vision teaching. This over-objective view of the
    covenant fails to distinguish between covenantal union in the
    visible church from the saving union of the invisible church.

-   The FV perspective involves incipient sacramentalism. Critics
    see the FV imputing the efficacy of the thing signified to the sign
    itself, whether in regard to [baptism](Baptism "Baptism") or the
    [Lord's Supper](Lord's_Supper "Lord's Supper"). The
    [sacraments](Sacraments "Sacraments") can communicate blessings
    apart from faith, and baptism appears to be a converting ordinance.
    The Federal Vision states that the unbelieving feed upon Christ
    when they partake of the Lord's Supper, and that a person is given
    new life by virtue of baptismal union with Christ.

## Federal Vision and the New Perspective on Paul

"While there is, to be sure, some overlap between the concerns of
NPP and the concerns of FV, it is not accurate to describe them as
a single movement. They properly represent different theological
traditions and different constituencies, and have separate aims and
objectives." (Guy P. Waters, *Federal Vision*, p. 3)

## Quotes

"After nearly three years of reading and listening widely and
carefully to Federal Vision proponents, including voluminous
correspondance with many of them, I am convinced that what the
Federal Vision offers is not a renewal or improvement of the
historic Reformed faith but a wholesale replacement of it with a
curious hybrid affecting soteriology, sacramentology, and
ecclesiology, closely similar to and heavily influenced by the
[New Perspective on Paul](New_Perspective_on_Paul "New Perspective on Paul")
associated with [James D. G. Dunn](James_Dunn "James Dunn"),
[E. P. Sanders](E._P._Sanders "E. P. Sanders"), and
[N. T. Wright](N._T._Wright "N. T. Wright")." (E. Calvin Beisner in
preface to Waters' *Federal Vision*).

"We do no better in closing than to recall Warfield's judgment of
Lewis Sperry Chafer: that "Mr. Chafer is in the unfortunate and,
one would think, very uncomfortable condition of having two
inconsistent systems of religion struggling together in his mind."
As with Chafer's Southern Presbyterianism and his Higher Life
Christianity, the evangelical and the sacerdotal, the monergistic
and synergistic, the rational and the dialectical doctrinal
sympathies of FV writers are, to borrow again Warfield's words,
"quite incompatible.... The two can unite as little as fire and
water."" (Guy Prentiss Waters'
*The Federal Vision and Covenant Theology: A Comparative Analysis*).
