**Feminism**, based on a belief in the fundamental equality of the
sexes, specifically promotes the rights and interests of women.
Within Christianity, feminism is primarily concerned with the role
of women in the church. A distinction may be made between two
groups: "Liberal-Christian feminists" who work from the standpoint
of a commitment to the Christian faith but accept the authority of
[Scripture](Scripture "Scripture") in only a limited way, and
"Evangelical feminists" who have a high view of Scripture and
believe that the Bible teaches the full equality of men and women
without role distinctions based on gender."

To many, liberal-Christian feminism and evangelical feminism are
both seen as included in the idea of Christian
[egalitarianism](Egalitarianism "Egalitarianism") (gender equality)
-- the difference being primarily in how they each deal with the
Scriptures.

To the liberal-Christian, the [Bible](Bible "Bible") is not viewed
as infallible or [inerrant](Inerrancy "Inerrancy"), and therefore
its authority is limited. The patriarchal framework of the Old
Testament and the New Testament teaching of Paul (which seems to
limit the role of women) are simply viewed as culturally obsolete
and wrong.

The evangelical feminist, who generally accepts the infallibility
of Scripture, seeks [hermeneutical](Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics")
(or interpretational) means, in addition to issues of cultural
limitation, to argue for
[egalitarianism](Egalitarianism "Egalitarianism"). However, they
attempt to do so while remaining faithful to the text of
Scripture.
