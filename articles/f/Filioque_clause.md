The **filioque clause** or more appropriately the
**filioque controversy** has to do with the Latin phrase,
translated "and the son", which was accepted as an addition to the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") by the Western churches
and subsequently opposed by the Eastern churches:

The Nicene Creed as confirmed by the First Council of
Constantinople in 381:

"We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who
proceeds from the Father. Who with the Father and the Son is
worshiped and glorified."
The Nicene Creed with the "filioque" as accepted by the Western
churches after the Synod of Toledo in Spain in 589:

"We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who
proceeds from the Father **and the Son.** Who with the Father and
the Son is worshiped and glorified."
The theological dispute between the Eastern and Western Church is
somewhat subtle, dealing with the persons of the Godhead and the
nature of the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"). However, it was a
continuing source of friction between the east and the west and was
eventually elevated to become one of the "official" causes of the
[Great Schism](Great_Schism "Great Schism") in 1054 A.D.
