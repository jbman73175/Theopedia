**Final Judgment** is the sentence that will be passed on our
actions at the last day (Matt. 25; Rom. 14:10, 11; 2 Cor. 5: 10; 2
Thess. 1:7-10). The judge is Jesus Christ, as mediator. All
judgment is committed to him (Acts 17:31; John 5:22, 27; Rev. 1:7).
"It pertains to him as mediator to complete and publicly manifest
the salvation of his people and the overthrow of his enemies,
together with the glorious righteousness of his work in both
respects." The persons to be judged are, (1) the whole race of Adam
without a single exception (Matt. 25:31-46; 1 Cor. 15:51, 52; Rev.
20:11-15); and (2) the fallen angels (2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 6).
The rule of judgment is the standard of God's law as revealed to
men, the heathen by the law as written on their hearts (Luke 12:47,
48; Rom. 2:12-16); the Jew who "sinned in the law shall be judged
by the law" (Rom. 2:12); the Christian enjoying the light of
revelation, by the will of God as made known to him (Matt.
11:20-24; John 3:19). Then the secrets of all hearts will be
brought to light (1 Cor. 4:5; Luke 8:17; 12:2, 3) to vindicate the
justice of the sentence pronounced. The time of the judgment will
be after the resurrection (Heb. 9:27; Acts 17: 31). As the
Scriptures represent the final judgment "as certain [Eccl. 11:9],
universal [2 Cor. 5:10], righteous [Rom. 2:5], decisive [1 Cor.
15:52], and eternal as to its consequences [Heb. 6:2], let us be
concerned for the welfare of our immortal interests, flee to the
refuge set before us, improve our precious time, depend on the
merits of the Redeemer, and adhere to the dictates of the divine
word, that we may be found of him in peace." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Judgment Seat

The Judgment Seat of Christ (or *bema seat*) is one of several
judgments described in the Bible, specific to individual believers
standing before God in the last day to receive their reward. Some
believe it is distinct from the event described in Revelation where
unbelievers are cast into the Lake of Fire.

The word *bema* is used in the Bible to describe the place where
defendant and accuser stand in front of a magistrate in a court
(Matthew 27:19, John 19:13), but also in classical Greek usage as
the evaluation stand for athletes. Although it is used
metaphorically in both ways in Paul's writings, it is more commonly
believed to be associated with reward than punishment.

(Cf. Romans 14:10, 1 Corinthians 9:24-27, 2 Corinthians 5:10)

## White throne judgment

The White Throne judgment is seen as the final judgment described
in the Bible. The name *White Throne* comes from the description
given in Rev. 20:11-15. Similarly there is what appears to be a
description of final judgment in Matthew 25:31-46. Some
[premillennialists](Premillennialism "Premillennialism") see these
as describing two judgments separated by the 1000 year
[millennial reign](Millennial_Kingdom "Millennial Kingdom") of
Christ on earth. Others
([amillennialists](Amillennialism "Amillennialism") and
[postmillennialists](Postmillennialism "Postmillennialism")) see
this as the same judgment as at the White Throne -- the final
judgment before the eternal state.
