The **First Council of Constantinople** was called by Byzantine
Emperor Theodosius I in 381 to confirm the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") and deal with other
matters of the [Arian](Arianism "Arianism") controversy. This was
the second of the first seven
[ecumenical councils](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils").
This council, which was attended by 186 bishops, settled two basic
issues: the deity of the Holy Spirit and the true humanity of
Christ.

The council affirmed the original Nicene Creed of faith as far as
it went but expanded the discussion on the Holy Spirit to combat
heresies. It is therefore called the "Nicene Creed of 381" or the
Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed to distinguish it from that of the
First Council of Nicaea (325 A.D.).

Specifically, this council expanded the 3rd article of the creed
dealing with the Holy Spirit to say that he is "the Lord, the Giver
of Life, Who proceeds from the Father, With the Father and the Son
he is worshipped and glorified".

The Council's decision on the Holy Spirit gave official endorsement
to the concept of the Trinity. By the end of the 4th century, the
Byzantine Emperor Theodosius "issued a decree that the doctrine of
the Trinity was to be the offical state religion and that all
subjects shall adhere to it". (Cf
