The **First Council of Nicaea** was the first ecumenical council of
bishops held in 325 AD at Nicaea in Asia Minor (modern Turkey). The
purpose was to resolve disputes in the church - primarily those
concerned with [Arianism](Arianism "Arianism") - regarding the
relationship between the [Father](God_the_Father "God the Father")
and [Son](Son_of_God "Son of God").
[Constantine](Constantine "Constantine") (ca. 288-377), the sole
emperor of the Roman Empire, feared that the church would split
over this theological issue and thus called a universal council. In
May 325^[[1]](#note-0)^ Constantine opened the council where
roughly 250-300 bishops attended, the majority from the
East.^[[2]](#note-1)^ The council produced the first truly
ecumenical creed which is known as the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") which became a test of
[orthodoxy](Orthodoxy "Orthodoxy") and set a precedent for future
councils.

## Background and historical setting

The main issue set before the Council of Nicaea concerned the
teachings of Arius (ca. 250-ca. 336), a presbyter from Alexandria.
The church was required to give a more concrete definition of
Jesus' relationship to the Father, further specifying his unique
status as "Son of God", "Word" or "Logos." Many solutions had been
proposed, yet the efforts to define Jesus'
[nature](Nature "Nature") had been unsatisfactory.

### Monarchianism

One of the proposals was known as
[Monarchianism](index.php?title=Monarchianism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Monarchianism (page does not exist)").
Coming from the [Greek](Greek "Greek") word *monarchy*, meaning
"one source", this view stressed the unity of God. One
Monarchianist,
[Sabellius](index.php?title=Sabellius&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sabellius (page does not exist)"),
taught that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were separate modes
from which the one God had appeared throughout history. These were
merely three names that described one reality. Followers of
Sabellius later became known as [Modalists](Modalism "Modalism").
Another variation of Monarchianism was known as
[Adoptionism](Adoptionism "Adoptionism"). Proponents of this view
taught that Jesus had been adopted by God and was given the
fullness of the divine presence. Neither view was found to be
satisfactory since both threatened the belief that Jesus was a
distinct person and was fully divine. ^[[3]](#note-2)^

### Origen and Arius

Origen (ca. 185-ca. 254), the great Alexandrian theologian, argued
that Jesus was "generated" from the Father but that this generation
was "eternal." His goal was to preserve the unity of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") and yet keep a real distinction
between the Father and Son. One of his followers,
[Arius](Arius "Arius") of Alexandria, did not seek to sustain this
balance. In 318 Arius first communicated his views to his bishop,
Alexander, stating

## Aftermath

The First Council of Nicaea did not end all debates. "For fifty
years after Nicaea, the Church debated the affirmation, "Of one
essence with the Father."^[[4]](#note-3)^
