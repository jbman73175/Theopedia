The **First London Baptist Confession** (first edition) was
published in 1644. The second edition "corrected and enlarged" was
originally published in 1646. The preface to this edition reads as
follows:

A confession of faith of seven congregations or churches of Christ
in London, which are commonly, but unjustly, called Anabaptists;
published for the vindication of the truth and information of the
ignorant; likewise for the taking off those aspersions which are
frequently, both in pulpit and print, unjustly cast upon them.
Printed in London, Anno 1646.
## Background

"In England during the 1630's and 1640's, Congregationalists and
[Baptists](Baptist "Baptist") of the Calvinistic persuasion emerged
from the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England"), termed
dissenters. Their early existence was marked by repeated cycles of
persecution at the hands of the established religion of crown and
Parliament.

"Presbyterians and Congregationalists suffered less than did
Baptists under this harassment. No little reason for their relative
success in resisting government tyrrany was their united front of
doctrinal agreement. All Presbyterians stood by thier
[Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")
of 1646. Congregationalists adopted virtually the same articles of
faith in the Savoy Confession of 1658. Feeling their substantial
unity with the paedobaptists suffering under the same cruel
injustice, Calvinistic Baptists met to publish their substantial
harmony with them in doctrine."

The First London Baptist Confession was drawn up to distinguish the
newly organized Calvinistic (Particular) Baptists from both the
[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") (General) Baptists and the
continental [Anabaptists](Anabaptists "Anabaptists").

The better known
"[Second London Confession](London_Baptist_Confession_of_1689 "London Baptist Confession of 1689"),"
published anonymously in 1677, was republished in 1689 with
endorsement upon the issuance of the Act of Toleration when William
and Mary assumed England's throne. This Second Baptist Confession
of 1689 is basically a re-statement of the Westminster Confession
with only the minor changes necessary to reflect the distinctives
in baptism.

In that Confession of Faith one will find stress placed upon the
law of God summarily comprehended in the Ten Commandments as a rule
of life for the believer, as with the Westminster Confession.
However, in the First London Confession of 1644, and in its second
edition of 1646, the stress is upon the New Covenant commands, or
law of Christ.

Today, the Calvinistic Baptists who prefer a
[New Covenant Theology](New_Covenant_Theology "New Covenant Theology")
perspective as opposed to the
[Covenant Theology](Covenant_Theology "Covenant Theology") of the
Westminster Confession adhere to the First London Baptist
Confession of 1646 rather than the Baptist Confession of 1689.
