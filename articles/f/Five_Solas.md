The **Five Solas** are five Latin phrases (or slogans) that emerged
from the
[Protestant Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation")
intended to summarize the Reformers' basic theological principles
in contrast to certain teachings of the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
of the day. "Sola" is Latin meaning "alone" or "only" and the
corresponding phrases are:

-   *Sola Fide*, by faith alone.
-   *Sola Scriptura*, by Scripture alone.
-   *Solus Christus*, through Christ alone.
-   *Sola Gratia*, by grace alone.
-   *Soli Deo Gloria*, glory to God alone.

These phrases may be found individually expressed in the various
writings of the 16th century Reformers, either explicitly or
implicitly, but they are not found presented as a list *per se*. It
is most likely the list of Solas came about later.^[[1]](#note-0)^

The following summary of the Five Solas is adapted from the modern
restatement in
[The Cambridge Declaration of the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals](The_Cambridge_Declaration_of_the_Alliance_of_Confessing_Evangelicals "The Cambridge Declaration of the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals")
(1996):

## Faith alone (*Sola Fide*)

[Justification](Justification "Justification") is by grace alone
through faith alone because of Christ alone. In justification
Christ's righteousness is imputed to us as the only possible
satisfaction of God's perfect justice. Our justification does not
rest on any merit to be found in us, nor upon the grounds of an
infusion of Christ's righteousness in us, nor that an institution
claiming to be a church that denies or condemns sola fide can be
recognized as a legitimate church.

*See main article: [Faith alone](Faith_alone "Faith alone")*
## Scripture alone (*Sola Scriptura*)

The inerrant Scripture (the Bible) is the sole source of written
divine revelation, which alone can bind the conscience. The Bible
alone teaches all that is necessary for our salvation from sin and
is the standard by which all Christian behavior must be measured.
It is denied that any creed, council or individual may bind a
Christian's conscience, that the Holy Spirit speaks independently
of or contrary to what is set forth in the Bible, or that personal
spiritual experience can ever be a vehicle of revelation.

*See main article: [Scripture alone](Scripture_alone "Scripture alone")*
## Christ alone (*Solus Christus*)

Our salvation is accomplished by the mediatorial work of the
historical Christ alone. His sinless life and substitutionary
atonement alone are sufficient for our justification and
reconciliation to the Father. It is denied that the gospel is
preached if Christ's substitutionary work is not declared and faith
in Christ and his work is not solicited.

*See main article: [Christ alone](Christ_alone "Christ alone")*
## Grace alone (*Sola Gratia*)

In salvation we are rescued from God's wrath by his grace alone. It
is the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit that brings us to
Christ by releasing us from our bondage to sin and raising us from
spiritual death to spiritual life. It is denied that salvation is
in any sense a human work. Human methods, techniques or strategies
by themselves cannot accomplish this transformation. Faith is not
produced by our unregenerated human nature.

*See main article: [Grace alone](Grace_alone "Grace alone")*
## Glory to God alone (*Soli Deo Gloria*)

It is affirmed that because salvation is of God and has been
accomplished by God, it is for God's glory and that we must glorify
him always. We must live our entire lives before the face of God,
under the authority of God and for his glory alone. It is denied
that we can properly glorify God if our worship is confused with
entertainment, if we neglect either Law or Gospel in our preaching,
or if self-improvement, self-esteem or self- fulfillment are
allowed to become alternatives to the gospel.
