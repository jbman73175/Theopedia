[Wayne Grudem](Wayne_Grudem "Wayne Grudem") notes that,

"If we assume that God's knowledge of the future is true (which
evangelicals all agree upon), then it is absolutely certain that
person A will believe and person B will not. There is no way their
lives could turn out any differently than this. Therefore it is
fair to say that their destinies are still determined, for they
could not be otherwise. But by what are their destinies determined?
If they are determined by God himself, then we no longer have
election based ultimately on foreknowledge of faith, but rather on
God's sovereign will. But if these destinies are not determined by
[God](God "God"), then who or what determines them? Certainly no
Christian would say that there is some powerful being other than
God controlling people's destinies. Therefore the only possible
alternative is to say they are determined by some impersonal force,
some kind of fate, operative in the universe, making things turn
out as they do. But what kind of benefit is this? We have then
sacrificed [election](Election "Election") in love by a personal
God for a kind of determinism by an impersonal force and God is no
longer to be given the ultimate credit for our
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation")" (*Systematic Theology*, p.
679).
