## Quotes

### Scriptural

"For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly
Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their
sins, your Father will not forgive your sins." -- Matthew 6:14-15
(NIV)

"Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall I
forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?'
Jesus answered, 'I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven
times.'1" -- Matthew 18:21-22 (NIV)

*1 Or seventy times seven*

"If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth
is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and
will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."
-- 1 John 1:8-9 (NIV)

### External Sources

-   "In Scripture, forgiveness is never sentimental. It is not
    'that's okay, don't worry about it.' Forgiveness doesn't point us
    to how civilized we are, or how sweet-tempered we should be.
    Forgiveness is a declaration that we have an eschatology [a secure
    future]." -- Russell Moore

    by [Tim Challies](Tim_Challies "Tim Challies") - "What we need to
    avoid is a man-centered approach to sin where we first ask 'how
    have I harmed myself with this sin.' Rather, we must turn to God
    and ask Him to forgive us, for our sin has been primarily against
    the Lord. We substitute self-forgiveness for true repentence before
    God and acceptance of His forgiveness."
