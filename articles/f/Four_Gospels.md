The **four Gospels** are the first four books of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"). They are each a
written narrative of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus
Christ. The four Gospels are:

-   [Gospel of Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew")
-   [Gospel of Mark](Gospel_of_Mark "Gospel of Mark")
-   [Gospel of Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke")
-   [Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John")

The first three of these are also called the
[Synoptic Gospels](Synoptic_Gospels "Synoptic Gospels"), because
they are similarly structured, and can be compared side by side.
