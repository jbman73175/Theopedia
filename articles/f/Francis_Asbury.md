[Bishop](Bishop "Bishop") **Francis Asbury** (1745-1816) was the
first great leader of American [Methodism](Methodism "Methodism")
and one of the most prominent religious figures in American
history.

Asbury was born at Handsworth, near Birmingham, England of
Methodist parents. He became a local preacher at 18 and was
ordained at 22. In 1771 he volunteered to travel to America. When
the American Revolution broke out in 1776 he was the only Methodist
minister to remain in America.

In 1784 [John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley") named Asbury and
[Thomas Coke](Thomas_Coke "Thomas Coke") as co-superintendents of
the work in America. The American Methodists named them both
"bishops". This marks the beginning of the "Methodist Episcopal
Church of the USA". For the next 32 years, Asbury led all the
Methodists in America.

Like Wesley, Asbury preached in all sorts of places: courthouses,
public houses, tobacco houses, fields, public squares, wherever a
crowd assembled to hear him. For the remainder of his life he rode
an average of 6000 miles each year, preaching virtually every day
and conducting meetings and conferences. Under his direction the
church grew from 1,200 to 214,000 members.
