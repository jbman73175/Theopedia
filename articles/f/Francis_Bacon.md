**Francis Bacon** (1561-1626) served as the Lord Chancellor of
England. His books, particularly *Advancement of Learning* (1605)
and *Novum Organum* (Latin for *New Instrument*, 1620), exerted a
powerful influence on the development of early modern science and
early modern thought.

## Religious orientation

His mother Anne Bacon held deep orthodox protestant convictions and
had Francis and his brother tutored in the Reformed creed as well
as in a less formal style reflecting an influence of continental
Calvinism. Francis's 1602 *Confession of Faith* mirrors Calvin's
*[Institutes of the Christian Religion](John_Calvin#The_Institutes "John Calvin")*.
Although some of Francis's writings do contain criticisms of
Protestant reformers and their later Puritan successors, his
learning program reflects typical Calvinist preoccupations: "the
Fall and its consequences, the importance of the earthly vocation,
the sanctity of work, and the duty to transform
society."^[[1]](#note-0)^
