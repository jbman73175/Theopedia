## Beckwith's conversion

"During the last week of March 2007, after much prayer, counsel and
consideration, my wife and I decided to seek full communion with
the Roman Catholic Church." ^[[1]](#note-0)^ Beckwith's reasoning
included his consideration of the Roman Catholic view of
[justification](Justification "Justification") ^[[2]](#note-1)^
which, when "correctly understood, is biblically and historically
defensible." The Washington Post also notes, "Beckwith said he was
also deeply affected by a
[joint declaration in 1999](Joint_Declaration_on_the_Doctrine_of_Justification "Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification")
by the Lutheran World Federation and the Catholic Church on the
doctrine of justification, which he said went a long way toward
eliminating this historical source of division." ^[[3]](#note-2)^
He also noted his reading of the
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers")
where he concluded that "the Early Church is more Catholic than
Protestant." ^[[4]](#note-3)^
