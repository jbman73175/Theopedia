Francis Schaeffer
**Francis A. Schaeffer** (1912-1984) is most famous for his writing
and his establishment of the [L'Abri](L'Abri "L'Abri") community.
Described as 'the last modern theologian' — but opposed to
theological Modernism —, Schaeffer was deeply committed to an
Orthodox Protestant faith which answered the questions of the age.

## Quotes

-   "...the hippies of the 1960s did understand something. They
    were right in fighting the plastic culture, and the church should
    have been fighting it too... More than this, they were right in the
    fact that the plastic culture - modern man, the mechanistic
    worldview in university textbooks and in practice, the total threat
    of the machine, the establishment technology, the bourgeois upper
    middle class - is poor in its sensitivity to nature... As a utopian
    group, the counterculture understands something very real, both as
    to the culture as a culture, but also as to the poverty of modern
    man's concept of nature and the way the machine is eating up nature
    on every side." (*Pollution and the Death of Man*)
-   "If Christianity is really true, then it involves the whole
    man, including his intellect and creativeness. Christianity is not
    just "dogmatically" true or "doctrinally" true. Rather, it is true
    to what is there, true in the whole area of the whole man in all of
    life." - (*Art and the Bible*)
