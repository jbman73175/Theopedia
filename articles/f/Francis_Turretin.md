Woodcut of Francis Turretin
**Francis Turretin** (October 17, 1623 - September 28, 1687) was a
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed")
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian"). He was the son of Benedict
Turrettini and was born at Geneva. Educated at Geneva, Leiden,
Utrecht, Paris, Saumur, Montauban, and Nimes, Turretin returned to
his native city and was made pastor of the Italian church (1648)
and professor of theology (1653).

Turretin is especially known as a zealous opponent of the theology
of Saumur (embodied by
[Moses Amyraut](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Amyraut "wikipedia:Moses Amyraut"),
and called [Amyraldism](Amyraldism "Amyraldism")), as an earnest
defender of the [Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") orthodoxy
represented by the [Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort"),
and as one of the authors of the
[Helvetic Consensus](Helvetic_Consensus_Formula "Helvetic Consensus Formula"),
which defended the formulation of double
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination") from the Synod of
Dort and the verbal inspiration of the Bible. Among his writings,
which are chiefly dogmatic in character, special mention should be
made of his *Institutio Thelogiae Elencticae* (3 parts, Geneva,
1679-1685), which is a dogmatic theology written in a polemic
fashion and which became a standard text in
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed")
[Christian](Christianity "Christianity") circles until it was
replaced by [Charles Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge")'s
*Systematic Theology* in the late 19th century.

Turretin greatly influenced the [Puritans](Puritan "Puritan"), but
today, he is a mostly forgotten
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant")
[scholastic](Scholasticism "Scholasticism") from the annals of
church history, though the rough English translation of his
*Institutes of Elenctic Theology* is still read by students of
theology. [John Gerstner](John_Gerstner "John Gerstner") called
Turretin "the most precise theologian in the Calvinistic
tradition."
