## Biography

His early years were frivolous, but an experience of sickness and
another of military service were instrumental in leading him to
reflect on the purpose of life. One day, in the church of San
Damiano, he seemed to hear Christ saying to him, "Francis, repair
my falling house." He took the words literally, and sold a bale of
silk from his father's warehouse to pay for repairs to the church
of San Damiano. His father was outraged, and there was a public
confrontation at which his father disinherited and disowned him,
and he in turn renounced his father's wealth--one account says that
he not only handed his father his purse, but also took off his
expensive clothes, laid them at his father's feet, and walked away
naked. He declared himself "wedded to Lady Poverty", renounced all
material possessions, and devoted himself to serving the poor. In
his day the most dreaded of all diseases was something known as
leprosy. (It is probably not the same as either the modern or the
Biblical disease of that name.) Lepers were kept at a distance and
regarded with fear and disgust. Francis cared for them, fed them,
bathed their sores, and kissed them. Since he could not pay for
repairs to the Church of San Damiano, he undertook to repair it by
his own labors. He moved in with the priest, and begged stones
lying useless in fields, shaping them for use in repairing the
church. He got his meals, not by asking for money so that he might
live at the expense of others, but by scrounging crusts and
discarded vegetable from trash-bins, and by working as a day
laborer, insisting on being paid in bread, milk, eggs, or
vegetables rather than in money. Soon a few companions joined him.

After three years, in 1210, the Pope authorized the forming of the
Order of Friars Minor, commonly called the Franciscans. ("Friar"
means "brother," as in "fraternity", and "minor" means "lesser" or
"younger."

Francis and his companions took literally the words of Christ when
he sent his disciples out to preach - "Preach as you go, saying,
"The kingdom of Heaven is at hand." ... You have received the
Gospel without payment, give it to others as freely. Take no gold,
or silver, or copper in your belts, no bag for your journey, no
spare garment, nor sandals, nor staff" (Matthew 10:7-10).

In 1219, Francis went to the Holy Land to preach to the moslems. He
was given a pass through the enemy lines, and spoke to the Sultan,
Melek-al-Kamil. Francis proclaimed the Gospel to the Sultan, who
replied that he had his own beliefs, and that moslems were as
firmly convinced of the truth of Islam as Francis was of the truth
of Christianity. Francis proposed that a fire be built, and that he
and a moslem volunteer would walk side by side into the fire to
show whose faith was stronger. The Sultan said he was not sure that
a moslem volunteer could be found. Francis then offered to walk
into the fire alone. The Sultan who was deeply impressed but
remained unconverted. Francis proposed an armistice between the two
warring sides, and drew up terms for one; the Sultan agreed, but,
to Francis's deep disappointment, the Christian leaders would not.
Francis returned to Italy, but a permanent result was that the
Franciscans were given custody of the Christian shrines then in
moslem hands.

Back in Italy and neighboring countries, the Order was suffering
from its own success. Then, as now, many persons were deeply
attracted by Francis and his air of joy, abandonment, and freedom.
What is overlooked is that these were made possible only by his
willingness to accept total poverty, not picturesque poverty but
real dirt, rags, cold, and hunger, and lepers with real pus oozing
from their sores and a real danger of infection. Many idealistic
young men were joining the Order in a burst of enthusiasm and then
finding themselves not so sure that such extremes of poverty were
really necessary. When there were only a few friars, they were all
known to Francis personally, and the force of his personality kept
the original ideals of the Order alive in them. Now that the Order
was larger, this was no longer enough. In 1220 Francis resigned as
minister-general of the Order, and in 1221 he agreed to a new and
modified rule, which he did not approve, but could not resist. He
died on 4 October 1226. The Franciscan split into the Conventual
Franciscans, who held a limited amount of property in common, and
the Spiritual Franciscans, who disavowed all property. They taught
that Christ and the twelve apostles had held no property, singly or
jointly. This view offended those who held property, and was
declared to be heretical (proof text, John 18:10; Jesus said to
Peter, "Put up thy sword...."). In 1318, several Spiritual
Franciscans were burned at the stake in Marseilles.

A story is told of the days when the friars first began to have
permanent houses. A beggar came by when Brother Juniper was at the
gate and asked for a little money. Brother Juniper said, "There is
no money in the house. But wait a minute. Last week someone gave us
an altar cloth with little silver bells attached. We don't need
those. I will cut them off for you. They will be as good as money."
And he did. When the sacristan learned what had happened, he
complained to the prior, who said, "We are fortunate that he did
not give away the cloth itself. But send him to me, and I will
scold him." Brother Juniper came, and the prior scolded him until
he was hoarse. Brother Juniper noticed that the prior was hoarse,
and went to the kitchen and cooked him some mint sauce. He brought
it to the prior, who had gone to bed. He said, "Father Prior, get
up and eat this mint sauce. It will be good for your throat." The
prior said, "I don't want any mint sauce. Go away and let me
sleep." Brother Juniper said, "It's good sauce, and will be good
for your throat." The prior said, "Go away, I don't want it."
Brother Juniper said, "Well, if you won't eat it, how about holding
the candle while I eat it?" This was too much for the prior. He got
up and they both ate.
