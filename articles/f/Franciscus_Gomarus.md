Franciscus Gomarus
**Franciscus Gomarus**, born January 30, 1563 in Bruges, died 1641,
was a Dutch theologian, a strict [Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism")
and opponent of the teaching of
[Jacobus Arminius](Jacobus_Arminius "Jacobus Arminius") (and his
followers) which was formally judged at the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort")

## Life

His parents, having embraced the principles of the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation"), emigrated to the
Palatinate in 1578, in order to enjoy freedom to profess their new
faith, and they sent their son to be educated at Strasbourg under
Johann Sturm. He remained there three years, and then went in 1580
to Neustadt, whither the professors of Heidelberg had been driven
by the elector-palatine because they were not
[Lutherans](Lutheran "Lutheran"). Here his teachers in theology
were Zacharius Ursinus (1534-1583), Hieronymus Zanchius (1560-
1590), and Daniel Tossanus (1541-1602). Crossing to England towards
the end of 1582, he attended the lectures of John Rainolds
(1549-1607) at Oxford, and those of William Whitaker (1548-1595) at
Cambridge. He graduated at Cambridge in 1584, and then went to
Heidelberg, where the faculty had been by this time re-established.
He was pastor of a Dutch Reformed Church in Frankfort from 1587
till 1593, when the congregation was dispersed by persecution. In
1594 he was appointed professor of theology at the University of
Leiden, and before going there received from the university of
Heidelberg the degree of doctor.

## Theology

He taught quietly at Leiden until 1603, when
[Jacobus Arminius](Jacobus_Arminius "Jacobus Arminius") came to be
one of his colleagues in the theological faculty, and began to
teach [Pelagian](Pelagianism "Pelagianism") doctrines and to create
a [new party](Arminianism "Arminianism") in the university. Gomarus
immediately set himself earnestly to oppose these views in his
classes at college, and was supported by Johann B. Bogermann
(1570-1637), who afterwards became professor of theology at
Franeker. Arminius sought to make [election](Election "Election")
dependent upon faith, whilst they sought to enforce absolute
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination") as the rule of
faith, according to which the whole Scriptures are to be
interpreted (J. A. Dorner, *History of Protestant Theology*, i. p.
417). Gomarus then became the leader of the opponents of Arminius,
who from that circumstance came to be known as Gomarists (dutch:
*contra-remonstranten*). He engaged twice in personal disputation
with Arminius in the assembly of the estates of Holland in 1608,
and was one of five Gomarists who met five Arminians or
Remonstrants in the same assembly of 1609. On the death of Arminius
shortly after this time, Konrad Vorstius (1569-1622), who
sympathized with his views, was appointed to succeed him, in spite
of the keen opposition of Gomarus and his friends; and Gomarus took
his defeat so ill that he resigned his post, and went to Middleburg
in 1611, where he became preacher at the Reformed church, and
taught theology and Hebrew in the newly founded Illustre Schule.
From this place he was called in 1614 to a chair of theology at
Saumur, where he remained four years, and then accepted a call as
professor of theology and Hebrew to Groningen where he stayed till
his death on the 11th of January 1641.

## Synod of Dort

He took a leading part in the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort"), assembled in 1618
to judge of the doctrines of Arminius. He was a man of ability,
enthusiasm and learning, a considerable Oriental scholar, and also
a keen controversialist. He took part in revising the Dutch
translation of the Old Testament in 1633, and after his death a
book by him, called the *Lyra Davidis*, was published, which sought
to explain the principles of Hebrew metre, and which created some
controversy at the time, having been opposed by Louis Cappel. His
works were collected and published in one volume folio, in
Amsterdam in 1645. He was succeeded at Groningen in 1643 by his
pupil Samuel Maresius (1599-1673).
