**Frank Stagg** (1911-2001) was a noted Southern
[Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") theologian, seminary professor,
author, and pastor over a 50-year ministry career. He taught New
Testament interpretation and Greek at New Orleans Baptist
Theological Seminar] from 1945 until 1964 and at Southern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, from 1964 until 1978.
His publications, recognitions and honors earned him distinction as
one of the eminent theologians of the past
century.^[[1]](#note-0)^^[[2]](#note-Samford)^ When preaching or
teaching, he read directly from the Greek New Testament,
translating it into English as smoothly as if he were reading from
an English translation. Other eminent theologians have honored him
as a "Teaching Prophet."^[[3]](#note-Talbert)^

## Personal

Dr. Frank Stagg was born October 20, 1911, on his grandfather's
rice farm near the small community of Eunice, Louisiana. Although
the family name comes from an English ancestor, the Stagg family
was of French Catholic descent, commonly called Cajuns. His
grandfather and his uncle were the first of the Staggs to become
Evangelical Christians. His uncle became a preacher who ministered
in the native "Cajun" dialect. Frank was proud of his Louisiana
French heritage and of his upbringing in the home of a Baptist
deacon and Sunday School teacher.

In his junior year at Louisiana College, Frank met the person who
was to become such an integral part of his life and work, Evelyn
Owen from Ruston, Louisiana. They married in 1935 and raised three
children—Ted, Bob and Ginger.

## A couple endeavor

Frank and Evelyn together wrote and edited
*Woman in the World of Jesus.*^[[5]](#note-2)^ The book is divided
into three parts:

1.  The world into which Jesus came
2.  Jesus and woman
3.  The early church and woman

## Beliefs

Counted among the "best-known progressive
activists,"^[[6]](#note-3)^ Stagg addressed a variety of
contemporary issues. These included civil rights, gender equity,
Vietnam, the First Gulf War, ecumenism and aging. He also argued
for the Bible's relevance. "The Bible is relevant," Stagg said. "We
don't have to make it relevant."^[[3]](#note-Talbert)^ He said that
the First Gulf War presented the ideal opportunity for Southern
Baptists to "reassess and reject" the just war doctrine and embrace
pacifism as the appropriate Christian response to all
wars.^[[7]](#note-4)^ He opposed Reformed points of doctrine such
as predestination and other Calvinist beliefs in Southern Baptist
life.^[[8]](#note-5)^

## Library collection

Through the years, Dr. Stagg amassed an extensive library and
wealth of knowledge and scholarship in the form of correspondence,
writings, articles, speeches, commentaries, book reviews,
photographs, sermon notes and even private musings.
*The Papers of Dr. Frank Stagg, 1938–1999* now reside at Samford
University in Birmingham, Alabama. The 36 feet of material
represent more than a half century of his life's journey and
Christian pilgrimage. His collection shares prominence in the
library with the manuscript collection of famed English theologian
and preacher
[Charles H. Spurgeon](Charles_H._Spurgeon "Charles H. Spurgeon").

## Recognition and honors

Frank Stagg is included in various lists of distinguished twentieth
century Baptist theologians: E. Y. Mullins, W. T. Connor, W. O.
Carver, Frank Stagg, W. W. Stevens, Dale Moody, Dallas Roark, James
Wm. McClendon, Morris Ashcraft, Frank Tupper, Warren McWilliams, A.
J. Conyers, and Curtis Freeman.^[[9]](#note-6)^ He also has been
called "one of the foremost interpreters of the New Testament among
Baptists in the twentieth century."^[[10]](#note-7)^

At the Louisville seminary he held the prestigious James Buchanan
Harrison Chair of New Testament Theology.

The Stagg-Tolbert Forum for Biblical Studies is an annual event
named in his honor. It is designed to make excellence in biblical
scholarship accessible to the lay person.^[[11]](#note-8)^
