**Frederic William Farrar** (7 Aug 1831 - 22 Mar 1903), an English
clergyman and author, was born in Bombay, India, and educated in
England. In 1876 he was installed canon of Westminster and rector
of St. Margaret's. He became archdeacon of Westminster in 1883 and
in 1885 he was appointed Bampton lecturer at Oxford, and took for
his subject "The History of Interpretation." He was appointed dean
of Canterbury in 1895, in which capacity he served until his death.
He was influential in the spread of the "Broad Church" movement and
was one of the founders of the institution known as the Anglican
Brotherhood.^[[1]](#note-0)^ His writings cover a wide range, from
school stories to Scripture commentaries and theological studies.
His *Life of Christ* (1874) and *Eternal Hope* (1878) have seen
several editions.

In *Eternal Hope* Farrar called into question the view of
everlasting punishment and "attacked eternal conscious torment as
unworthy of the love and fairness of God. He dismissed the doctrine
of purgatory, spurned annihilationism, and was unable to embrace
[universalism](Universalism "Universalism") wholeheartedly. 'He
preferred to maintain a reverent agnosticism, though he was
prepared to affirm that the fate of man was not 'finally and
irrevocably sealed at death.' He is probably best labeled a hopeful
universalist." *Mercy and Judgment* (1881) Farrar defended
[universalism](Universalism "Universalism") at length.
