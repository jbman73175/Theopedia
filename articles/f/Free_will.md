Probably the most common definition of **free will** is the
"ability to make choices without any prior prejudice, inclination,
or disposition,"^[[1]](#note-0)^ and specifically that these "free
will" choices are not ultimately predestined by God.

According to the [Bible](Bible "Bible"), however, the choices of
man are not only ultimately determined by
[God](Sovereignty_of_God "Sovereignty of God"), but morally
determined by one's [nature](Nature "Nature"). Man is indeed a free
moral agent and freely makes choices, but in his natural state he
necessarily acts in accordance with his
[fallen nature](Total_depravity "Total depravity"). Man willingly
makes choices that flow from the heart, and [sin](Sin "Sin") is
also always attributed to the desires of the heart (James 1:13-15).
When a person turns to Christ, he does so not because of his own
"free will", but because God has supernaturally enabled and moved
him to do so through [regeneration](Regeneration "Regeneration").
God never coerces man's will, rather God gives the ability to
believe through the work of the Holy Spirit.

This is a doctrinal distinction between the theologies of
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") and
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"): In Arminianism, God saves
those who believe of their own free will. In
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"), God saves those who willingly
believe as a result of sovereign enablement by the regenerating
work of the Spirit.

Rather than man's will being free, Jesus tells us that, "everyone
who commits sin is a [slave](Slavery "Slavery") to sin," (John
8:34). The heart, until born again, is "deceitful above all things,
and desperately sick" (Jeremiah 17:9). God saw in man that "every
intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually"
(Genesis 6:5). "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me
draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day." (John 6:44).

Man is most free in [heaven](Heaven "Heaven"), where he is morally
unable to sin. True freedom isn't freedom *to* sin, but freedom
*from* sin.

## Definitions

The Compatibilist believes that free will is "compatible" with
determinism (as in the sovereignty of God). The incompatibilist
says that the free will is "incompatible" with determinism. The
Libertarian is an incompatibilist who consequently rejects any
determinism associated with the sovereignty of God. Hence,
[Libertarian free will](Libertarian_free_will "Libertarian free will")
is necessarily associated with both
[Open Theism](Open_Theism "Open Theism"), which maintains that God
does not foreknow or predetermine the free choices of man, and
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"), which contends that God
in his [omniscience](Omniscience_of_God "Omniscience of God")
foresees man's free choices and reacts accordingly. Libertarian
freedom is the general view of liberal Protestantism and a growing
number of evangelicals.

## Reasons for believing

### Compatibilist freedom

In compatibilism, free will is affected by human nature and man
will never choose contrary to his nature and desires. Man will
always do what he desires most at any particular moment - even when
there are competing desires. And man is not able to freely change
the direction or the degree of his desires. God is the one who must
turn his heart.

"But the things that proceed out of the mouth come from the heart"
(Matthew 15:18)
"For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the evil
thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, deeds of
coveting and wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy,
slander, pride and foolishness. All these evil things proceed from
within and defile the man." (Mark 7:21-23, also Matthew 15:19)
"The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the Lord; he
turns it wherever he will." (Proverbs 21:1)
"What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there?
May it never be! For He says to Moses, 'I will have mercy on whom I
have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.'
So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who
runs, but on God who has mercy." (Romans 9:14-16)
The main arguments for this position are as follows:

-   It is overwhelmingly testified to in scripture, even in an
    explicit manner.
-   The Bible speaks of faith as a gift.
-   *Sola gratia*, by grace alone, necessarily implies that
    everything we have is a gift.
-   That God is God necessarily implies that he is the primary
    cause of all reality.
-   The nature of
    [God's foreknowledge](Foreknowledge_of_God "Foreknowledge of God")
    necessarily implies that God foreordains the future.
-   Man cannot be held accountable for his choices if they are
    ultimately spontaneous and random. The intent of his heart must be
    the criteria.
-   In heaven, when man is finally redeemed from his flesh and its
    corresponding worldly desires, he will no longer want to sin.
-   True freedom is freedom *from* sin, not the freedom *to* sin.

*See main page: [Compatibilism](Compatibilism "Compatibilism")*
### Libertarian freedom

In libertarianism (not to be confused with the political ideology),
free will is affected by human nature but man retains ability to
choose contrary to his nature and desires. Man has the moral
ability to turn to God in Christ and believe of his own "free
will," apart from a divine, irresistible grace. Indeed, according
to Open Theism, God is anxiously waiting to see what each person
will do, for he cannot know ahead of time what the choice might be.
Or, according to Arminianism, God chooses to save those whom he
foresees will believe of their own free will.

The main arguments for this position are as follows:

-   The commands and invitations of God in scripture seem to imply
    a moral ability in man to receive spiritual things, incline the
    heart, and respond positively.
-   It seems unfair that God would blame sinners for their sin if
    God's will is ultimately irresistible. (cf. Romans 9:19)
-   That God is love seems to imply that God would not predestine
    anyone to go to hell.

*See main page: [Libertarian free will](Libertarian_free_will "Libertarian free will")*
## Objections

### Objections to libertarian freedom

-   Libertarian freedom is primarily a philosophical notion, not a
    scriptural one. It's proponents place an undue reliance upon human
    philosophy.
-   Libertarian freedom necessarily implies that man has the power
    of *ex nihilo* creation.
-   The logical extension of libertarian freedom is that God
    himself is not free. But God is the freest being in the universe,
    and *can only* act in accordance with his holy nature. Therefore,
    true freedom cannot be libertarian.
-   The premise goes against the very purpose of the law. "Now the
    law came in to increase the trespass..." (Romans 5:20). "The very
    commandment that promised life proved to be death to me." (Romans
    7:10)
-   This is precisely the objection that Paul briefly interacted
    with in Romans 9:

"You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who
can resist his will?” But who are you, O man, to answer back to
God? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me
like this?” Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of
the same lump one vessel for honored use and another for
dishonorable use? What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to
make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of
wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches
of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand
for glory—even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but
also from the Gentiles?" -Romans 9:19-24, ESV
-   When this very subject arose in Romans 9, Paul quoted the
    following scripture:

"...though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good
or bad—in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not
because of works but because of his call—she was told, “The older
will serve the younger.” As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau
I hated.” " (Romans 9:11-13) There is a mystery here: God loves the
world and is kind and patient toward it, meaning to lead it to
repentance. But ultimately, God's purpose in election stands, and
his electing love is for his Bride alone. "So then he has mercy on
whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills." (Romans 9:18)
### Objections to compatibilistic freedom

1.  It seems to be logically contradictory to say that God is
    totally sovereign and yet people have freedom.
2.  Argument from Scripture: the Bible seems to be comfortable with
    [determinism](index.php?title=Determinism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Determinism (page does not exist)"),
    and the biblical authors do not seem compelled to make a case for
    free will.
    ^[***[citations\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
3.  The argument for compatibilistic freedom is essentially an
    argument for determinism because it reduces man's freedom to a
    level that is neither consistent with any traditional definition of
    "freedom." In other words, the concept of freedom becomes so
    qualified by God's sovereignty, that the doctrine is essentially
    irrelevant. If compatibilistic freedom is simply another way to
    package determinism in more acceptable terms, then it can be argued
    against with the same reasoning that one argues against
    determinism.

## Theological framework and the will of man

### Augustinianism / Calvinism

In [Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"), man has free will in that he
is a free moral agent and makes real choices that will have very
real consequences, but he is limited by his fallen nature. God
desires from man a worship that comes not ultimately from
compulsion, but from love and desire. Man's will is never coerced
by God (James 1:13-15). It always flows from his spiritual
[nature](Nature "Nature") and the desires of his heart. But in his
fallen state man cannot discern spiritual things, please God, or
trust in Christ (Romans 8:7, 1 Corinthians 2:14). Man is free to
*will* what he most desires, but, until born again, his heart is in
bondage to sin. Furthermore, his will is ultimately subordinate to
the providence and sovereignty of God. This may be regarded as a
"compatibilist" view of free will which sees man's free choices as
compatible with God's absolute sovereignty. As Augustine put it,
"the human will does not obtain grace by freedom, but obtains
freedom by grace," (*On Rebuke and Grace to Valentinus*).

*See main page: [Total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity"), [Predestination](Predestination "Predestination"), and [Compatibilism](Compatibilism "Compatibilism")*
The following views are essentially called "libertarian free will"
which re-interprets
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination") and determinism
on the part of God.

### Arminianism

"The providence of God is subordinate to creation; and it is,
therefore, necessary that it should not impinge against creation,
which it would do, were it to inhibit or hinder the use of free
will in man. . ." *The Works of James Arminius*, Vol. 2, in
*The Master Christian Library* [CD-ROM] (Albany, OR: AGES Software,
1997), 460
In Arminianism the fall indeed corrupted man's nature but God's
"[universal prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace")"
has restored his free will and moral ability toward good. Although
the Arminians pay homage to the doctrines of
[original sin](Original_sin "Original sin") and
[total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity"), what they
give with one hand, they take away with the other -- the result
being libertarian free will *by grace* rather than *by nature*.

### Semi-Pelagianism and Pelagianism

Semi-Pelaginism acknowledges that man's will and nature are
somewhat affected (injured) by the Fall, but mankind retains
libertarian free will. The end result is essentially the same as
the Arminian view -- the difference being free will "by nature"
rather than by the Arminian's universal prevenient grace. In
Semi-Pelagianism, man has a free will essentially unaffected by the
fall and not limited by his natural desires, inclinations, or prior
dispositions. By way of reference,
[Pelagianism](Pelagianism "Pelagianism") says man's will (and
nature) is not affected at all by the Fall.

## Quotes

"The decisive point is whether freedom in the Christian sense is
identical with the freedom of Hercules: choice between two ways at
a crossroad. This is a heathen notion of freedom. Is it freedom to
decide for the devil? The only freedom that means something is the
freedom to me myself as I am created by God. God did not create a
neutral creature, but his creature. He placed him in a garden that
he might build it up; his freedom is to do that. When man began to
discern good and evil, this knowledge was the beginning of sin. Man
should not have asked this question about good and evil, but should
have remained in true created freedom. We are confused by the
political idea of freedom. What is the light in the Statue of
Liberty? Freedom to choose good and evil? What light that would be!
Light is light and not darkness. If it shines darkness is done away
with, not proposed for choice! Being a slave of Christ means being
free"^[[2]](#note-1)^
