The **freedom of God**, also called **divine freedom**, designates
that [God](God "God") is free and "not constrained by anyone other
than himself. He does what he pleases (Ps. 115:3), and therefore he
is always free... He is not bound to the dictates of anyone else.
He does make promises, to be sure, which obligate him to do certain
things, but he makes those promises voluntarily." ^[[1]](#note-0)^
