**Freemasonry** is a fraternal organization whose traditions date
to Medieval craft guilds but which was formally organized as a
secret religion in the 18th century ^[[1]](#note-0)^. The term
*freemason* is thought to originally refer to artisans (masons) who
either (A) worked in ornamental *(free)* stone as opposed to rough
stone, or (B) were exempt from the control of local guilds and
thereby *free* to work wherever their services were needed
^[[2]](#note-1)^. Despite ardent claims to the contrary,
Freemasonry is "an eminently religious
institution"^[[3]](#note-2)^, holding itself up to be "...the
custodian and depository (since Enoch) of the great philosophical
and religious truths, unknown to the world at large, and handed
down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied
in symbols, emblems and allegories"^[[4]](#note-3)^.

Two primary tenets of Freemasonry are belief in a Supreme Being
(often referred to as the "Great Architect of the Universe") and
the Universal Brotherhood of all men. The beliefs of Freemasonry
borrow from all kinds of pagan traditions, including the ancient
pantheism of Egypt and Babylon, the mysticism of the East, and the
monotheisthic religions of the
West^[[5]](#note-4)^^[[6]](#note-5)^^[[7]](#note-6)^^[[8]](#note-7)^.

    written scriptures of his own religion" (Pike, p 226).

    brother of the order to assign to each such higher and even divine
    characteristics as his creed and truth require" (Pike, p 525).
