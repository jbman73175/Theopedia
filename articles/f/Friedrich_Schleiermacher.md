Friedrich Schleiermacher
**Friedrich Schleiermacher** (1768-1834), often called the
**father of modern theology**, was a German philosopher and one of
the greatest [Protestant](Protestant "Protestant")
[theologians](Theologian "Theologian") of the 19th century. He is
often regarded as the father of modern hermeneutics, i.e. the
science of
[interpreting the Bible](Interpretation_of_the_Bible "Interpretation of the Bible"),
and known for his many other works in the area of
[systematic theology](Systematic_theology "Systematic theology").
Otto Weber states that, "Retrospectively, the dogmatics of the 19th
century can be understood essentially as the direct, indirect, or
negatively received influence of the theology of Friedrich Daniel
Schleiermacher, one of the most powerful personalities in all of
[church history](Church_history "Church history"), in some ways
comparable with [Augustine](Augustine "Augustine")."

## Biographical sketch

Born in Breslaw, Germany in 1768, Schleiermacher was the son of a
Prussain army chaplain. At age nine his father came into contact
with [Pietism](Pietism "Pietism") and entered into a devotional
lifestyle. Friedrich was sent at age 15 to a boarding school run by
the Moravian Brethren, a pious evangelical group that traced its
roots back to [Jan Huss](Jan_Huss "Jan Huss"). ^[[2]](#note-1)^.
While at boarding school Schleiermacher began to question his faith
to which the Moravians did not care to give an answer.

As time went on Schleiermacher left to study at the University of
Halle. Upon his fathers advice he studied
[Immanuel Kant](Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") who at this point in
time was "causing a storm throughout the intellectual world." In
1790 he became a Reformed minister and later moved to Berlin in
1796 to be a hospital chaplain. While there he met Friedrich
Schlegel with whom it was decided to attempt a translation of the
works of Plato in the German language. ^[[3]](#note-2)^

In 1799 Schleiermacher published
*On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers*. "It defended
religion against its Enlightenment critics. Religion, he argued,
was not a philosophy, nor abstract metaphysical thought, nor
natural science, nor adherence to dogmatic formulae, but the "sense
and taste for the infinite" consisting primarily in feeling; belief
and action are secondary. Knowledge of the soul and knowledge of
God are inseparable—a concept that had been presented more than
1000 years earlier by St. Augustine. His thought thus has a
subjective focus, but it should not on that account be deemed sheer
"subjectivism." Schleiermacher's careful analysis of religious
feelings always has in view, at least by implication, the infinite
and eternal reality to which these feelings are responses. The
Speeches are sometimes held to be pantheist in tone, but he did not
identify the world with the "infinite and eternal." Rather, he held
that it is always in and through one's experience of the whole
interconnecting realm of the finite that there comes a sense of
dependence upon the infinite ground of all things."
^[[4]](#note-3)^

After the invasion of Napolean in 1806 Schleiermacher left and
moved back to Berlin. In 1810 he became the dean of theology at the
University of Berlin and in 1815 became the rector of the
University. ^[[5]](#note-4)^ However, it was in 1821 that
Schleiermacher wrote *The Christian Faith* with a revision written
in 1830. This book was based on his *Speeches* (1799). "The
*Speeches* provided the agenda for the new conception of religion;
*The Christian Faith* sets forth that new conception."
^[[6]](#note-5)^ Modern systematic theologies have followed his
model ever since.

Although Schleiermacher received attention for his published works,
he achieved his greatest fame as a pastor. Jonathan Hill describes
him as a "brilliant, charismatic speaker" ^[[7]](#note-6)^ and his
ability to preach to the hearts and minds of his listeners was
evident as many traveled great distances to hear him preach. His
proudest achievement came as he was awarded the Order of the Red
Eagle by the king of Prussia.

Schleiermacher died in 1834. "His coffin, carried by twelve of his
students, was followed through the streets of Berlin by a line of
mourners over a mile long, among whom were he king and crown
prince; and thousands crowded the streets to watch."
^[[8]](#note-7)^ Schleiermacher opened up the possibilities of
Christian thought to blossom and develop in ways previously
unimagined.
