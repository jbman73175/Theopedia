**Christian Fundamentalism** refers to the movement that arose
mainly within American and British Protestantism in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries, led by conservative
[evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") Christians in
reaction to [modernism](Modernism "Modernism") and
[liberalism](Liberalism "Liberalism") in the mainline
denominations. This movement included not only denominational
evangelicals (such as the Princeton theologians
[B. B. Warfield](B._B._Warfield "B. B. Warfield") and
[J. Gresham Machen](J._Gresham_Machen "J. Gresham Machen")), but a
growing breed of
[premillennial](Premillennialism "Premillennialism") and
[dispensational](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism")
independants such as [D. L. Moody](D._L._Moody "D. L. Moody"), R.
A. Torrey, and the independant Bible college and Bible church
movement.

Taking its name from
[The Fundamentals](The_Fundamentals "The Fundamentals")
(1910-1915), a twelve-volume set of essays designed to combat
Liberal theology, the movement grew by leaps and bounds after World
War I. The term "Fundamentalist" was perhaps first used by Curtis
Lee Laws, a British journalist for the *Watchman-Examiner*, in 1920
to designate those who were willing to do "battle royal for the
Fundamentals." [[1]](http://mb-soft.com/believe/text/fundamen.htm)

## Fundamentalism versus broader Evangelicalism

The nature of the *Fundamentalist movement*, while originally a
united effort within conservative
[evangelicalism](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism"), evolved during
the early-to-mid 1900s to become more separatist in nature and more
characteristically dispensational in its theology.
Premillennialism, dispensationalism, and separatism began to
overwhelmingly characterize the most popular leaders, which also
had an effect on the way that "evangelicals" as a whole were
perceived by outside observers. This eventually led to purposeful
distinctions between fundamentalism and what was seen as the
broader [evangelicalism](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism").

For example, it should be noted that The "Princeton Theologians",
particularly Machen, eventually distanced himself from the
fundamentalist movement because of its emphasis on separating from
culture instead of engaging it. In a letter to the board of
trustees of Bryan Memorial University refusing their offer to make
him president Machen wrote:

> I never call myself a "Fundamentalist." There is indeed, no
> inherent objection to the term; and if the disjunction is between
> "Fundamentalism" and "Modernism," then I am willing to call myself
> a Fundamentalist of the most pronounced type. But after all, what I
> prefer to call myself is not a "Fundamentalist" but a
> "Calvinist"—that is, an adherent of the Reformed Faith. As such I
> regard myself as standing in the great central current of the
> Church's life—the current which flows down from the Word of God
> through Augustine and Calvin, and which has found noteworthy
> expression in America in the great tradition represented by Charles
> Hodge and Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield and the other
> representatives of the "Princeton School."^[[1]](#note-0)^
