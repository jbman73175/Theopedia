**G. Campbell Morgan** (1863-1945) was born on a farm in Tetbury,
England, the son of a Baptist minister. When Campbell was 10 years
old, [D. L. Moody](D._L._Moody "D. L. Moody") came to England for
the first time, and the effect of his ministry, combined with the
dedication of his parents, made such an impression on young Morgan,
that at the age of 13, he preached his first sermon. Two years
later, he was preaching regularly in country chapels during his
Sundays and holidays.

In 1886, at the age of 23, he left the teaching profession, for
which he had been trained, and devoted himself to preaching and
Bible exposition. He was ordained to the Congregational ministry in
1890. He had no formal training for the ministry, but his devotion
to studying of the Bible made him one of the leading Bible teachers
in his day. His reputation as preacher and Bible expositor grew
throughout England and spread to the United States.

In 1896, D. L. Moody invited him to lecture to the students at the
Moody Bible Institute. This was the first of his 54 crossings of
the Atlantic to preach and teach. After the death of Moody in 1899,
Morgan assumed the position of director of the Northfield Bible
Conference. After five successful years in this capacity, he
returned to England (in 1904) and became pastor of Westminster
Chapel of London. His preaching and weekly Friday night Bible
classes were attended by thousands. Leaving Westminster Chapel in
1919, he once again returned to the United States, where he
conducted an itinerant preaching/teaching ministry for 14 years.
Finally, in 1933, he returned to England, where he again became
pastor of Westminster Chapel and remained there until his
retirement in 1943. He was instrumental in bringing
[Martyn Lloyd-Jones](Martyn_Lloyd-Jones "Martyn Lloyd-Jones") to
Westminster in 1939 to share the pulpit and become his successor.
Morgan died on May 16, 1945, at the age of 81.
