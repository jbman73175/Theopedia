**George Ernest Wright** (1909-1974) was both an archaeologist and
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") scholar. As an
archaeologist he was known for his work in the study and dating of
pottery. He rose to prominence with his publication of
*The Pottery of Palestine from Earliest Times to the End of the Early Bronze Age*
(1937). As a biblical theologian, his work
*God Who Acts: Biblical Theology as Recital* (1952) was the focus
of much scholarly attention. His 1969 book
*The Old Testament and Theology* criticized the direction taken by
[biblical theology](Biblical_theology "Biblical theology") in the
interim seventeen years.^[[1]](#note-0)^

"He studied with William Foxwell Albright at Johns Hopkins
University, where he received his M.A. (1936) and PhD. (1937). He
taught Old Testament History and Theology at McCormick Seminary
from 1939-1958. He joined the faculty of Harvard Divinity School in
1958, where he was Parkman Professor and the Curator of the Semitic
Museum (the latter beginning in 1961) until his death in
1974."^[[2]](#note-1)^
