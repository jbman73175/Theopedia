G. K. Chesterton
**Gilbert Keith Chesterton** (1874 - 1936), born in London, was a
prolific English writer of the early 20th century. Though he
considered himself a mere "rollicking journalist," he was actually
a prolific and gifted writer in virtually every area of literature
including journalism, poetry, biography, fiction, and Christian
[apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics"). A man of strong opinions
and enormously talented at defending them, his exuberant
personality nevertheless allowed him to maintain warm friendships
with people such as George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, with whom
he vehemently disagreed.

Chesterton was notably concerned in what he wrote with religious
matters. His classic *Orthodoxy* was published in 1909, the purpose
of which (in his own words) was "to attempt an explanation, not of
whether the Christian Faith can be believed, but of how he
personally has come to believe it," (from the *Preface*). He found
in [Christianity](Christianity "Christianity") the answers to the
dilemmas and paradoxes he saw in life. A liberal critic of
[inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy"), he formally became a
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") in 1922.

[C. S. Lewis](C._S._Lewis "C. S. Lewis") considered Chesterton's
*The Everlasting Man* (1925) to be the best popular defense of the
full Christian position he knew of (*The Collected Letters*, Vol.
2) and listed it among the top ten books most influencial in
shaping his philosophy of life (article in *The Christian Century*
June 6, 1962).

He wrote a hundred books, contributions to 200 more, hundreds of
poems, including the epic *Ballad of the White Horse*, five plays,
five novels, and some two hundred short stories, including a
popular series featuring the priest-detective, *Father Brown*. In
spite of his literary accomplishments, he considered himself
primarily a journalist.
