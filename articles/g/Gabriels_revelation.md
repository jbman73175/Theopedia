## History of the tablet

### Source

The tablet was purchased by a Jordanian antiquities dealer by an
Israeli-Swiss collector. David Jeselsohn, the owner, who is himself
an expert in antiquities showed it to Ada Yardeni, who specializes
in Hebrew writing. Yardeni and her colleague, Binyamin Elitzur
published a long analysis of the text in “Cathedra” the
Hebrew-language history and archaeology quarterly.Analysis of the
lettering and language indicates that the words on the tablet were
written sometime in the late first century BCE. The ancient source
of this tablet is of yet unknown. Ada Yardeni states, "Where did
this stone come from? I wish we knew. Chances are it came from
Jordan. It simply appeared on the antiquities market, however, and
was acquired by Zurich collector David Jeselsohn, who has kindly
permitted me to publish it."^[[1]](#note-AdaYardeniArticle)^
Retired professor, Stan Seidner contends that it reflects the
Apocalyptic beliefs of the day, many which are found in the Dead
Sea Scrolls, as antecedent and predictive writings of Christianity.
He also suggested the use of infra-red technological applications,
similar to what had been utilized on Dead Sea Scroll Material in
the recent past. Yehezkel Kaufman Professor of Biblical Studies at
Hebrew University originally translated the tablet, and declared
the text “revolutionary,” during a cconference onducted at the
Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

### Date

Ada Yardeni states, "It is clearly dated by the shape and form of
the letters (paleography) to sometime between the late first
century B.C.E. and early first century C.E.—around the turn of the
era, the same period as the scrolls. This dating is confirmed by
the Hebrew of the text (post-Biblical and
pre-Mishnaic)."^[[1]](#note-AdaYardeniArticle)^
