The churches of **Galatia** were founded by Paul himself (Acts
16:6; Gal. 1:8; 4:13, 19). They seem to have been composed mainly
of converts from paganism (4:8), but partly also of Jewish
converts, who probably, under the influence of Jewish teachers,
sought to incorporate the rites of Judaism with Christianity.

It is debatable as to whether Paul wrote to the ethnic territory of
Galatia or the Roman province in his
[Epistle to the Galatians](Epistle_to_the_Galatians "Epistle to the Galatians").
