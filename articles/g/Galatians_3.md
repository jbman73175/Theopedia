### 28

*There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. (ESV)*
#### Background

This text must be seen in light of the background and cultural
context in which Paul wrote this part of the letter. For example,
the following ancient Greek statement was apparently condoned by
both Socrates and Plato where the speaker gives thanks that he,

was born a human being and not an animal, that I was born a man and
not a woman, and that I was born a Greek and not a barbarian.
Social distinctions were a large part of Paul's culture, and we see
this in the Jewish version of this thanksgiving, prayed three times
daily by the male,

Blessed art thou, Lord, who hast not made me a heathen, who hast
not made me a woman, and who hast not made me a brutish man.
It was sometimes included with "that I was not made a slave."
