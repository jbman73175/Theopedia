**Gary Habermas** (b. 1950) is an American Christian apologist,
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian"), and philosopher of religion.
He is Distinguished Professor of Apologetics and Philosophy and
chairman of the department of philosophy and theology at Liberty
University in Lynchburg, Virginia.

Habermas is noted for his work defending the
[resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection") and is often cited in
the area of Christian [apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics"). He
has also specialized in cataloging and communicating trends among
scholars in the field of historical [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") and
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") studies.

In 1985, Habermas and Antony Flew debated the question of Jesus'
resurrection as a literal and historical/physical event, before a
crowd of three thousand people. The debate was judged by
professional debate judges and was published as a book under the
title *Did Jesus Rise from the Dead? The Resurrection Debate*
(Harper & Row, 1987).

## Habermas' journey to belief in the Resurrection

Gary R. Habermas was born just outside Detroit, Michigan in 1950.
Although he was raised in a Christian home and attended a German
Baptist Church, he began having serious doubts about Christianity.
For more than ten years, he faced uncertainty about key Christian
claims and searched other religious and non-religious systems,
especially [naturalism](Naturalism "Naturalism"). His studies
centered chiefly on investigating various
[world views](Worldview "Worldview"), occasionally getting close to
what he thought might be the proper approach. During this time, as
he explains, "The last thing I did at night was recall what I had
learned that day to further my search. Early the next morning, it
seems that the first thing that came to my mind was, 'Where did I
end my studies last night?'" This continued for several agonizing
years.

Habermas' interest in the field of
[apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics") began early in his search
when he realized that some religions made claims that could be
either verified or falsified. He searched the various religious
systems to ascertain if such claims were verifiable. After several
years of study, he concluded that very few religious claims could
be substantiated. Habermas concluded that even Christianity
suffered in this sense. While certainly having more evidential
considerations than other religions, there always seemed to be a
reason why the argument could not be finalized. While Habermas
conducted detailed studies of creation, fulfilled
[prophecy](Prophecy "Prophecy"), archaeological discoveries, and
the general reliability of the Old and New Testaments, he
constantly asked if there were any "clinching" arguments.

Habermas especially studied the notion that Eastern metaphysics
were confirmed by modern physics, as well as the claims made on
behalf of various other holy books. He reached the conclusion that,
while religious beliefs could be held by faith, they usually lacked
great evidence and could not be "proven" to be true.

Habermas' search frequently took the form of debating with various
adherents of non-Christian as well as Christian views. He told
practitioners from both camps that their beliefs were not as
grounded as they would like to believe. He especially recalls one
encounter where an exasperated Christian told him that he was
filled with [demons](Demons "Demons")! Once his mother called to
see how he was doing, and he announced that he thought he was close
to becoming a Buddhist, his latest research interest.

During this time, one subject began to appeal to Habermas more than
any other. He realized that if Jesus had been raised from the dead,
this would go a long way toward arguing that Christianity was true.
He also studied the founders of the major religious traditions,
along with some lesser-known figures, to see if there were other
claims that someone had been raised from the dead. He was
especially interested in whether there was any historical or other
evidence for any such teachings. Thirteen hundred note cards later,
he was well on the way to a lifetime of being "hooked" on the
subject of Jesus' [resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection").
Little did he know that his early years of study on this subject
would begin his fascination with the topic that has never
lessened.[[1]](http://www.garyhabermas.com/vitainnuce.htm)
