Geerhardus Vos
**Geerhardus Vos** (1862-1949), a Reformed theologian and one of
the most distinguished representatives of the Princeton Theology,
he is sometimes called the father of Reformed Biblical Theology.

Born in the Netherlands, he came to the United States in 1881 when
his father accepted the pastorate of a Christian Reformed Church in
Grand Rapids, Michigan. Geerhardus graduated from the Theological
School (now Calvin College) in 1883. Vos went to Princeton Seminary
to do post-graduate work, then studied for one year at the
University of Berlin, followed by two years at the University of
Strasburg, where he earned his doctorate.

In 1892, Vos accepted appointment as professor of the newly created
chair of Biblical Theology at Princeton Seminary, where he taught
until he retired in 1932. Among his students were such eminent men
as [J. Gresham Machen](J._Gresham_Machen "J. Gresham Machen"),
[John Murray](John_Murray "John Murray"), and
[Cornelius Van Til](Cornelius_Van_Til "Cornelius Van Til"). During
his 39 years at Princeton, Dr. Vos laid the groundwork for his
best-known books: *Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments* and
*The Pauline Eschatology*.
