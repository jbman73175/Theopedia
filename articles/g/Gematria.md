**Gematria** is a type of numerological study that may be defined
as one of more systems for calculating the numerical equivalence of
letters, words, and phrases in a particular Hebrew text. These
systems are used for the purpose of gaining insight into
interrelating concepts and for finding correspondences between
words and concepts. Although not identical, gematria is also in the
same orbit as the so-called “Bible Codes” and “Equi-distant Letter
Sequences” (ELS) that have become fashionable recently.

Within the earliest Jewish traditions, groups of Jewish scholars
counted the number of times each letter appeared in the Scriptures
(as well as the number of words, verses, paragraphs, etc.). These
textual specialists were called *Soferim* (counters). The Soferim
ensured that every Torah scroll (and the other books of the
*Tanakh*) were identical, noting any unusual words and spellings
and replicating them exactly through their scribal arts. Many Jews
believe that Ezra the Scribe instituted many of the practices of
the Soferim.

According to most practitioners, there are several methods used to
calculate the numerical value for individual words and phrases.
When converted to a number, words/phrases can then be compared to
other words/phrases and similarities drawn.
