**Genesis** ([Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew"): בְּרֵאשִׁית, **Be-reshit**,
meaning *"In the beginning"*) is the first book of the
[Book of::Bible](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Book_of::Bible&action=edit&redlink=1 "Book of::Bible (page does not exist)").
It is one of the five books of [Moses](Moses "Moses"), commonly
referred to as the [Pentateuch](Pentateuch "Pentateuch"). The
authorship of Genesis is tied to a larger argument for the
[Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch](Mosaic_authorship_of_the_Pentateuch "Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch").

## Organizational Structure

There are basically two theories of the organizational structure of
the text. The first dividing the book into two sections: the
Primeval History and the Patriarchal History. The second
structuring it by the generations of several people throughout the
work.

## Primeval/Patriarchal Theory

The first eleven chapters of Genesis deal with a wide range of
topics. Obvious are those of [creation](Creation "Creation"),
[humanity](Humanity "Humanity"), [sin](Sin "Sin") or
[the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall"), and God's action(s) involved in
these issues. Chapters 3-11 establish a major theme: the moral
failure and decay of humankind. It was clear that "the wickedness
of humankind was great on the earth, and... every inclination of
the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually," (Gen 6:5).
The
[flood](index.php?title=Flood&action=edit&redlink=1 "Flood (page does not exist)")
shows God's determination to deal with the human condition, and
after it takes place, God makes his
[covenant with Noah](Noahic_Covenant "Noahic Covenant").

Chapters 12-50 take a turn as Genesis begins to deal with
[Abraham](Abraham "Abraham"),
[Isaac](index.php?title=Isaac&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isaac (page does not exist)"),
[Jacob](Jacob "Jacob"), and [Joseph](Joseph "Joseph"). Important to
this section is God's
[covenant with Abraham](Abrahamic_Covenant "Abrahamic Covenant")
through whom he will bless all nations. The remainder of Genesis
traces the story of Abraham and his decendants. Theological themes
emerge such as [election](Election "Election"),
[covenant](Covenant "Covenant"), and promise, all of which can be
seen in the stories throughout Genesis. Further developments
involve the
[Abrahamic Covenant](Abrahamic_Covenant "Abrahamic Covenant") which
contains New Testament implications (e.g., Galatians 3:16-18).

## Toledot Theory

An additional theory of the structure of Genesis is known as the
the Toledot Theory. This argues that this book is a book of
generations, toledot. It argues that Chapter 2 begins the
generations of Heaven; and that subsequent sections are started
with the phrase: "these are the generations of." The sections would
then be the generations of: Adam, Noah, Shem, Abram, Isaac, Jacob,
and perhaps Joseph.
