[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament")
This chapter records [Abraham](Abraham "Abraham")'s interactions
with Abimelech, king of Gerar (Genesis 20:2), when Abraham and his
family venture into that area (Genesis 20:1). By previous
arrangement with his wife Sarah, and for fear of his life, Abraham
states that Sarah is in fact his sister (Genesis 20:13). Abimelech
took Sarah to be his own wife (Genesis 20:2), but was prevented by
God from consummating the marriage (Genesis 20:4, Genesis 20:17).

### 6

***"Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her."***
([ESV](ESV "ESV"))
God showed mercy to Abimelech by preventing him from doing wrong,
albeit unwittingly. This shows the
[sovereignty of God](Sovereignty_of_God "Sovereignty of God") in
this situation. God allowed the situation to go 'so far, but no
further'.

### 11

***"Abraham said, "I did it because I thought, There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.""***
(ESV)
"This was slander on Abimelech. Abimelech had a great deal of
reverential fear for God and a very commendable sense of right and
wrong. Abraham was blind to this because of his own foolish pride
and disobedience." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

### 13

***"And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This is the kindness you must do me; at every place to which we come, say of me, He is my brother'.""***
(ESV)
This was an agreement between Abraham and Sarah from when they
first left the land of Ur (Genesis 12).

## Critical views

"Critical scholars reckon the story a duplicate of 12:10ff.,
[Genesis 12:10-20] ultimately on the ground that a man doesnot
repeat a lapse of this kind. ^[[2]](#note-1)^ The critical process
is described by James Montgomery Boice,

"Whenever there are two similar accounts, as here, they regard them
as variants of one original account and then compare both to try to
get back to what they regard as the earliest tradition. ... This is
bad scholarship however." ^[[3]](#note-2)^
