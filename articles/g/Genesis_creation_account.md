Different interpretations of the **Genesis creation account** have
been proposed. The views considered in this article are those which
deal specifically with the text of Genesis 1 and 2. It is not the
main aim of this article to handle concerns dealing with scientific
issues.

Almost all views of the opening of Genesis consider the natural
division of the text to come to an end at 2:3 or 2:4a; for this
reason, when referring to the creation account of Genesis 1, the
discussion in fact has in view the entire passage of Genesis
1:1-2:3 or 4a.

## Monotheism of the account

"The Genesis account differs markedly from the other cosmogonies in
its assumption of monotheism. There is a single Creator, and no
other gods are involved in the creative acts, either as helpers or
as opponents. There is no primeval goddess, so the model of
procreation for the creative process has no place in the account.
It is also notable that there is no
[theogony](index.php?title=Theogony&action=edit&redlink=1 "Theogony (page does not exist)")
as a preface to cosmology. The existence of the Creator is assumed,
and there is no attempt to explain it. There are no lesser gods
whose coming into being needs explaining. Some scholars think that
the plural in Genesis 1:26 (“Let *us* make …”) is a remnant of an
earlier polytheistic account. However, they agree that this is not
the significance of the plural in the account as it stands. Most
take it as either an address to the heavenly council (Wenham) or as
a plural of self-deliberation (Westermann)." (T. Desmond Alexander,
David Weston Baker, *Dictionary of the Old Testament: Pentateuch*,
p. 135)


## General approaches to the text

### Scientifically accurate theological text

"Throughout the narrative, the God-revealed and real cosmogony (as
opposed to merely literary, analogous, anthropomorphic, or didactic
cosmogony) is the vehicle by which Moses wages war against the
heathen worldviews of the day while buttressing the convictions of
the Hebrew people. If we analyze the text fairly, we cannot ignore
or relegate to a secondary status the cosmogony it contains.
Cosmogony is central in every way."^[[1]](#note-0)^
Within this view there are two major positions concerning the issue
of the meaning of "day".

#### Actual 24-hour day view

"The 24-hour view holds that God created the universe and all life
in six sequential natural days marked by evenings and mornings.
According to this view, God created the universe and all life in
approximately 144 hours and in the sequence presented in Genesis
1."^[[2]](#note-1)^

In addition to arguing from the internal evidence of scripture,
proponents of this view point to church history. J. Ligon Duncan
and David Hall write,

"While one may find in the record of historical theology a small
smattering of orthodox theologians who approached the days of
Genesis as something other than normal days, he will not find
detailed debate over this matter until the sixteenth century and
will seldom find debates between orthodox divines arguing for and
against the days as long ages until the nineteenth
century."^[[3]](#note-2)^
#### Day-age view

"The day-age view... agrees with the 24-hour view that the events
recorded in Genesis 1 are sequential. The day-age view, however,
parts company with the 24-hour view regarding the length of the
creation days. According to the day-age view, God did not create
the universe and all life in six 24-hour days, but in six
sequential ages of unspecified, though finite,
duration."^[[4]](#note-3)^

Hugh Ross and Gleason L. Archer argue that "a sinless Adam could
not finish his sixth-day duties" in a mere 24-hour
period^[[5]](#note-4)^, and that part of God's Sabbath rest is
ceasing to introduce new kinds of life forms.^[[6]](#note-5)^

On the Church Fathers, they write,

"Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Lactantius, Victorinus of Pettau, and
Methodius of Olympus all explicitly endorse six consecutive
thousand-year periods for the Genesis creation days... Though
uncertain about the duration of the creation week, Clement of
Alexandria, Origen, and Augustine explicitly rejected the 144-hour
notion."^[[7]](#note-6)^
### Non-scientific figurative theological text

This view, also called the "framework view",

"holds that the days of Genesis form a figurative framework in
which the divine works of creation are narrated in a topical,
rather than sequential, order. This view holds that the picture of
God completing His work of creation in six days and resting on the
seventh was not intended to reveal the sequence or duration of
creation, but to proclaim an eschatological theology of
creation."^[[8]](#note-7)^
The view takes the authorial intent of Genesis 1 to be theological
rather than scientific and his organization of the material to be
thematic rather than chronological. In this view, scientifically
inaccurate views on cosmology did not find expression in the text.
The interests of the author of Genesis lie not with providing an
ordered account of the creation so much as the drawing out of
themes and the development of theology. This view agrees that many
of the parts of the text are "literal", but it takes the complete
account as figurative^[[9]](#note-8)^ or symbolic.

The main evidence given for this view is a two-triad view of the
six days of creation, the relationship between day 1 and day 4, the
figurative nature of the divine Sabbath day which lasts forever,
and the heavy use of anthropomorphic language.

Some evangelicals of this view focus on a cosmic temple creationism
motif (see section below). G. K. Beale writes,

"[S]ome evangelicals believe that the Old Testament borrows
mythological beliefs about the cosmos that are clearly incompatible
with modern scientific knowledge... [T]hese cosmic portrayals that
some believe to represent ancient mythology and ancient naïve
scientific views are, in reality, better understood as symbolic
depictions of the cosmos as a massive temple where God dwells. Such
a perspective does not intend to convey ancient or modern
scientific views or mythological views of the world but rather a
theological conception about the heavens and earth as God’s
dwelling place."^[[10]](#note-9)^
### Cosmogonical approach

God communicated theology (i.e. about giving function and order to
cosmos) through culture's scientifically naive worldview, and this
worldview found expression in the text in a way that does not
compromise the message. John Walton writes,

"If we think about the example of creation texts, we realize that
if God were to reveal his work of creation in our modern culture,
he would have to explain how it related to the Big Bang theory or
to evolution. His revelation would focus on the origins of the
physical structure of the universe because that is what is
important in our cultural perspective. In the ancient world,
though, physical structure was relatively insignificant. People at
that time were much more interested in the aspect of bringing order
out of chaos and the divine exercise of jurisdiction demonstrated
in giving everything a role and a purpose. In this context, any
account of origins would of necessity have to be presented with
these ancient ideas in mind.
"The biblical text, in other words, formulated its discussion in
relation to the thinking found in the ancient literature. It should
be no surprise, then, if areas of similarity are found. This is far
different from the contention that Israelite literature is simply
derivative mythology. There is a great distance between borrowing
from a particular piece of literature (as has been claimed in
critical circles) and resonating with the larger culture that has
itself been influenced by its literatures. When Americans speak of
the philosophy of 'eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,'
they are resonating with an idea that has penetrated society rather
than borrowing from the writings of Epicurus."^[[11]](#note-10)^
## Old Testament view of the cosmos

Describing [ANE](ANE "ANE") portrayals in the "recent escalation
and profusion of ancient Near Eastern studies", G. K. Beale
writes,

"Accordingly, Old Testament writers’ minds were shaped by the
typical language and conceptions of the world that were a part of
the overall way of thinking in their ancient culture. The universe
was commonly understood as a composition of three tiers: the
heavens, the earth, and the netherworld. The significant features
of each of these parts include the following: (1) the earth was
composed of only one continent that had mountains at its perimeters
to hold up the sky; (2) the sky was a solid mass, a tent or dome,
which separated the earthly seas from the heavenly sea that was
just above the dome; (3) deities dwelt in the heaven above the
earth; (4) the heavens were a composition of three or more levels
with pavements of different kinds of stone; and (5) the earth was
understood either to float on or be surrounded by cosmic waters or
to be supported by pillars."^[[12]](#note-11)^
### Solid dome or atmospheric expanse?

G. K. Beale explains,

"Some believe that the [raqiya] was rock-solid and formed a dome
over the earth, reflecting the [ANE](ANE "ANE") mythological
viewpoint without any qualification or critique... For example, P.
H. Seely argues for such a view in an
[article published in the *Westminster Theological Journal*](http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/OTeSources/01-Genesis/Text/Articles-Books/Seely-Firmament-WTJ.pdf).
He contends that the [raqiya\`] in Genesis 1:6, 14, 17, 20 and in
Ezekiel must be considered solid since this was the common ANE
view, both from the mythological perspective and from the viewpoint
of the ancient common person."^[[13]](#note-12)^
G. K. Beale, opposing this view, writes, "[W]e just do not know
that all ancients believed the sky was a solid dome or that there
was anything near unanimity on this point."^[[14]](#note-13)^ Hugh
Ross also takes exception to this view of the
expanse.^[[15]](#note-14)^

### "Earth" and "seas"

## Other textual issues

### *yom* (day)

The Hebrew word *yom* for "day" in the creation account, can mean
many different things depending on the context that it is used,
just like any word in any language.

1.  It can mean a 24-hour period of time
2.  the bright part of it (as in "day and night")
3.  an extended period of time (Gen 2:4)

This principle is true even in the English language, as in "In my
father's day (period of time) it took three days (24 hour-days) to
drive across the state during the day (bright part of a
24-hr.day)".

The creation account defines a "day" as morning and evening, as in
v. 8: "...and there was evening and there was morning, a second
day." Outside the book of Genesis, whenever "day" is accompanied by
a number or by the terms "evening" or "morning", it always refers
to a 24-hour day. Additionally, the fourth commandment of the
[Decalogue](Decalogue "Decalogue") (Exodus 20:8-11) makes reference
to the Genesis creation account and instructs the Israelites to
imitate God's pattern of work and rest:

"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. *Six days* you shall
labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of the
LORD your God; ...
*For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth*, the sea
and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore
the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy."
They were commanded to work "six days" (that is, six 24-hour days)
because God made the heavens and the earth in "six days".
*Prima facie*, six-day creationists hold, it is natural to
interpret Genesis 1:1-2:3 as teaching that God created everything
in six, 24-hour days. The biggest obstruction to this argument is
that Hebrews 4 suggests that the seventh day is not in fact a
simple 24-hour day, but rather began after God's six days of
creating and continues unto the consummation
([Meredith Kline](Meredith_Kline "Meredith Kline"),
*Kingdom Prologue*). Additionally, critics say, the genre of the
creation account has bearing on how it and its component parts
should be understood.^[[16]](#note-15)^

### Gap implied between verses one and two?

The gap theory maintains that an indefinite span of time exists
between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2. This time span is usually
considered to be quite large (millions of years) and is also
supposed to encompass the so-called “geologic ages.” Proponents of
the gap theory also suggest that a cataclysmic judgment came upon
the earth during this gap period resulting from the fall of Lucifer
(Satan). Therefore, they would say, the ensuing verses of Genesis
chapter 1 describe a re-creation or reforming of the earth from a
chaotic state and not an initial creative effort on the part of
God.
