## Biographical summary

Ladd converted to Christianity in 1929 after hearing a young
graduate of Gordon College preach in his
[Methodist](Methodism "Methodism") church. In 1933 he was ordained
in the Northern Baptist Convention (now American Baptist) and
pastored three congregations.^[[1]](#note-0)^ While pastoring at
the last congregation, Ladd taught at both Gordon College and the
Divinity school.^[[2]](#note-1)^

He later received a Bachelor of Theology from Gordon College (1933)
and attended Gordon Divinity School where he received a Bachelor of
Divinity (1942). Ladd then spent two years at Boston University
before enrolling at Harvard where he was supervised by Henry J.
Cadbury and received his PhD in Biblical and Patristic Greek in
1949.^[[3]](#note-2)^ He joined the faculty of
[Fuller Theological Seminary](Fuller_Theological_Seminary "Fuller Theological Seminary")
in Pasadena, CA in 1950 where he remained for the final thirty
years of his academic career. Ladd had a stroke in 1980, and died
in 1982. Ladd "was arguably the most important New Testament
scholar of the post-war evangelical resurgence in North
America."^[[4]](#note-3)^
