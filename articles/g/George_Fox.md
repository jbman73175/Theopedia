**George Fox** (July 1624 â€“ January 1691) was an English
[Nonconformist](Nonconformist "Nonconformist") and a major early
figure often considered the founder of the Religious Society of
Friends, commonly known as the [Quakers](Quakers "Quakers"). Living
in a time of great social upheaval, he rebelled against the
emerging religious and political establishment by proposing a
radical and uncompromising approach to the
[Christian faith](Christianity "Christianity"). His journal is a
text popular even among non-Quakers for its vivid account of his
personal journey.
