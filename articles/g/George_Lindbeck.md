**George Lindbeck** (b. 1923) is a [Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran")
theologian and known today as an advocate of
[postliberalism](Postliberalism "Postliberalism"). However, "for
most of his career he was known primarily as a medievalist and,
above all, as a theologian at the forefront of ecumenical
dialogue." ^[[1]](#note-0)^ Lindbeck has a BA from Gustavus (1943)
and a BD and PhD from Yale University (1946; 1955). While still
finishing his doctoral degree, Lindbeck was appointed to the Yale
faculty in 1952 where he remained until his retirement in 1993. He
is well known for his Cultural-Linguistic approach to
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") which he argues in his book,
*The Nature of Doctrine* (1984).
[Hans Frei](Hans_Frei "Hans Frei"), Paul Holmer and David Kelsey
have had a major influence on his thought.
