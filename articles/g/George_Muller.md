George Müller
**George Muller**, or Müller or Mueller^[[1]](#note-0)^
(1805-1898), a Prussian-born English evangelist and philanthropist.
Especially known for his work in establishing orphanages in Bristol
and founding the
[Scriptural Knowledge Institution for Home and Abroad](http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts/Ends52%5C0000202652_ac_20080229_e_c.pdf)
in 1834 to provide practical support for missionaries. Muller was
an early leader of the Open Brethren movement, a branch of the
[Plymouth Brethren](Plymouth_Brethren "Plymouth Brethren").^[[2]](#note-1)^

    (MP3), by [John Piper](John_Piper "John Piper")

As John Piper recalls, "He saw the great awakening of 1859 which he
said led to the conversion of hundreds of thousands. He did follow
up work for [D. L. Moody](D._L._Moody "D. L. Moody"), preached for
[Charles Spurgeon](Charles_Spurgeon "Charles Spurgeon"), and
inspired the missionary faith of
[Hudson Taylor](index.php?title=Hudson_Taylor&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hudson Taylor (page does not exist)").
. . He spent most of his life in Bristol, England and pastored the
same church there for over sixty-six years — a kind of independent,
premillennial, Calvinistic Baptist church that celebrated the
Lord's supper weekly and admitted non-baptized people into
membership. If this sounds unconventional, that would be accurate."

Reflecting on the Calvinistic
[doctrines of grace](Calvinism "Calvinism"), Muller wrote his diary
(1829) the following:

"Before this period I had been much opposed to the doctrines of
[election](Election "Election"),
[particular redemption](Particular_redemption "Particular redemption"),
and
[final persevering grace](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints");
so much so that, a few days after my arrival at Teignmouth, I
called election a devilish doctrine. I did not believe that I had
brought myself to the Lord, for that was too manifestly false; but
yet I held, that I might have resisted finally. And further, I knew
nothing about the choice of God's people, and did not believe that
the child of God, when once made so, was safe for ever. In my
fleshly mind I had repeatedly said, If once I could prove that I am
a child of God for ever, I might go back into the world for a year
or two, and then return to the Lord, and at last be saved. But now
I was brought to examine these precious truths by the word of God.
Being made willing to have no glory of my own in the conversion of
sinners, but to consider myself merely as an instrument; and being
made willing to receive what the Scriptures said; I went to the
Word, reading the New Testament from the beginning, with a
particular reference to these truths. To my great astonishment I
found that the passages which speak decidedly for election and
persevering grace, were about four times as many as those which
speak apparently against these truths; and even those few, shortly
after, when I had examined and understood them, served to confirm
me in the above doctrines." ^[[4]](#note-3)^
