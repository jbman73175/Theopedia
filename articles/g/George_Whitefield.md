George Whitefield
**George Whitefield** was a minister in the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England") and one
of the leaders of the [Methodist](Methodist "Methodist") movement.
He was born on December 16, 1714 at the Bell Inn, Gloucester, and
died in Newburyport, Massachusetts on September 30, 1770. In
contemporary accounts, he, not
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley"), is spoken of as the
supreme figure and even as the founder of
[Methodism](Methodism "Methodism"). He was famous for his preaching
in America which was a significant part of the
[Great Awakening](Great_Awakening "Great Awakening") movement of
Christian revivals.

Whitefield preached his first sermon in the Crypt Church in his
home town of Gloucester. In 1738, he went to America, becoming
minister of Savannah, Georgia. Returning home in the following
year, he resumed his evangelical activities, preaching in the open
air when churches refused to admit him.

He parted company with Wesley over the doctrine of
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination"); Whitefield was a
follower of [Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") in this respect.
Three churches were established in England in his name: one in
Bristol and two others, the "Moorfields
[Tabernacle](Tabernacle "Tabernacle")" and the "Tottenham Court
Road Chapel", in London. Later the society meeting at the second
Kingswood School at Kingswood, a town on the eastern edge of
Bristol, was also called Whitefield's Tabernacle. His legacy is
still felt in America, as well. The Old South Presbyterian Church
in Newburyport, Massachusetts was built for the evangelist's use,
and before dying Whitefield requested to be buried under the pulpit
of this church; his tomb remains there to this day. Some of his
followers joined the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion", spreading
a Calvinistic form of Methodism in Wales, and Whitefield became the
Countess's chaplain. In an age when crossing the Atlantic Ocean was
a long and hazardous adventure, he visited America seven times,
making 13 trans-Atlantic crossings in total! It is estimated that
throughout his life, he preached more than 18,000 formal sermons
and if less formal occasions are included, that number might rise
to more than 30,000. In addition to his work in America and
England, he made 15 journeys to Scotland, 2 to Ireland, and one
each to Bermuda, Gibraltar, and The Netherlands.

In 1738 Whitefield preached a series of revivals in Georgia. Here
he established the Bethesda Orphanage, which still exists to this
day. In Georgia there was originally a prohibition on slavery.
However in 1749 there was a movement to introduce it there, which
Whitefield supported. He owned slaves who worked at the orphanage,
and these were bequeathed to the Countess of Huntingdon when he
died. When he returned to America in 1740 he preached nearly every
day for months to large crowds of sometimes several thousand people
as he travelled throughout the colonies, especially New England.

Like his contemporary and acquaintance,
[Jonathan Edwards](Jonathan_Edwards "Jonathan Edwards"), Whitefield
preached with a [Calvinist](Calvinist "Calvinist") theology. He was
known for his powerful voice and his ability to appeal to the
emotions of a crowd, and unlike most preachers of his time spoke
extemporaneously, rather than reading his sermon from notes. It is
difficult to say wherein the effect of his preaching lay; certainly
not in his language or logic, for his printed sermons contain
nothing remarkable; it must have been by earnestness and charm of
voice that he could attract to him the rich as well as the poor.
