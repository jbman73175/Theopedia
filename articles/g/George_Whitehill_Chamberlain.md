**George Whitehill Chamberlain** (August 13, 1839-July 31, 1902)
was a [Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") minister and
[missionary](Missionary "Missionary"), one of the planters of
[Presbyterian Church of Brazil](Presbyterian_Church_of_Brazil "Presbyterian Church of Brazil")
(Igreja Presbiteriana do Brasil).

Chamberlain studied at the Union Theological Seminary, New York
(1857-1859). He was ordained by the
[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America](Presbyterian_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America "Presbyterian Church in the United States of America")
(Presbytery of Rio de Janeiro) in July 8, 1866.

Chamberlain moved to Brazil for medical reasons. He was having eye
problems and his doctor advised him to take a nautical trip in
order to reestablish his vision to normal conditions. He arrived at
Rio de Janeiro in July 21, 1862. He brought with him a
recommendation letter for
[Alexander Latimer Blackford](Alexander_Latimer_Blackford "Alexander Latimer Blackford"),
who was already working in Brazil by them. Chamberlain visited SÃ£o
Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, Brazilian provinces where he worked as
English teacher.

After a short period back in the United States, in order to
complete his studies, Chamberlain came back to Brazil where he was
ordained by the Presbytery of Rio de Janeiro in 1866.

In 1870, along with his wife, Mary Chamberlain, he started giving
classes in his house for [protestant](Protestant "Protestant")
children, in what became the Mackenzie Presbyterian University
(Portuguese: Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie). Chamberlain was
one of the main contributors in the development of this
institution.

Chamberlain was one of the main leaders of Presbyterianism in
Brazil during its first decades of existence.
