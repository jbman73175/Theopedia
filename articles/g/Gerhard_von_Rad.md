**Gerhard von Rad** (1901-1971) was a prominent German
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") scholar whose work
brought back focus to the Old Testament. He was educated at the
University of Erlangen and at the University of Tübingen and later
received honorary Doctorates from the Universities of Lund, Wales,
Leipzig and Glasgow. He also taught at the University of Jena,
University of Gottingen, Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg.
The *Encyclopedia of World Biography* notes him as having
"developed the 'tradition history' approach to the Old Testament
that has dominated the study of the Bible for the last 40
years."^[[1]](#note-0)^ His dissertation was on "Das Gottesvolk im
Deuteronomium" (The People of God in Deuteronomy).

"The historical events of his lifetime, including the two World
Wars, left their mark on him, and it was not least his detestation
for the nazis's treatment of the Jews, which called his interest
for OT forth, and he became a member of the academic world in stead
of the clergy. Two fields of research are in a special way
connected to his name. He was one of the founders of the
traditio-historical method. Being one of A. Alt's doctoral
students, history and the development of traditions always played
an important part in his research. The historical credo (Deut 26)
and its importance for the making of the Hexateuch has made a great
impact on the scholarly world. The other field is OT theology, in
which he stressed the theology in the transmission of the biblical
traditions, in Vol. I the historical tradition and in Vol II the
prophetic tradition. His way of doing Theologie was quite different
from the traditional German Old Testament
Theology."^[[2]](#note-1)^

"Von Rad's views were highly controversial, evoking considerable
heat. Many of his theories have not stood the test of time, but it
would be difficult to find another person who has contributed so
much to the understanding of the Old Testament. It may be that in
truth he wrote a history of Israelite religion rather than an Old
Testament theology, but he insisted that the Hebrew Bible be
understood in the context of the religious life of ancient Israel.
That is surely a correct insight." ^[[3]](#note-2)^
