The **glory of Jesus** can refer to different things. *Glory* was
something that Jesus had in heaven (John 12:41; 17:5, 24); it was
visible in his earthly ministry (John 1:14; 8:54; 11:4; 13:32;
17:1, 5, 10, 22); and it was something he received when he
[ascended](Ascension_of_Christ "Ascension of Christ") to the
Father(Acts 3:13). "Glory" can generally refer to a distinguished
quality that is evident in a person, and also refers to the honor
intended for that person (Burge,
*Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels*, p. 269).

Since Jesus is associated with God, it is natural that he would
reflect God's glory. Jesus reveals his glory, in conjunction with
the Father's, in different ways: signs (John 2:11), his crucifixion
(John 7:39; 2:16 & 23; 13:31-32), and in his being (Hebrews 1:3).

## Light

The term "light" within the
[Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") is connected with
Jesus' glory. Since glory is pictured as a radiant quality, light
and glory often appear together in the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") and in
[Hellenistic](Hellenism "Hellenism") religion. John employs "light"
twenty-three times (triple that of any other Gospel) to express the
Hebraic thought that in bringing God's glory, so too Christ ushers
divine light into the world (John 1:4-9; 3:19; 8:12; 12:46)." -
(Burge, p. 270).
