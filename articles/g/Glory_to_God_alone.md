**Glory to God alone**, also known as **Soli Deo gloria**, is one
of the [Five Solas](Five_Solas "Five Solas") of the Reformatiom
meaning *all the glory is due to God alone*, since he did all the
work â€” not only in the atonement of Christ, but even granting the
faith which unites us to Christ and brings us into the salvation
provided by his atonement.
