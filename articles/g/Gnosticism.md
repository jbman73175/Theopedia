**Gnosticism** is a [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") which is made up of a
diverse set of beliefs. It is the teaching based on the idea of
*gnosis* (a Koine Greek word meaning "secret knowledge"), or
knowledge of transcendence arrived at by way of internal, intuitive
means. While Gnosticism thus relies on personal religious
experience as its primary authority, early "Christian" Gnostics did
adopt their own versions of authoritative Scriptures, such as those
found at *Nag Hammadi* in Egypt.

What we know about Gnosticism comes from
[Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") who studied twenty of the most
influential Gnostic writers and defined and criticized their
beliefs. Other
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers"),
such as [Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian") and
[Origen](Origen "Origen") also provide information regarding
Gnostic beliefs. Lastly, many Gnostic writings were discovered at
the
[Nag Hammadi Library](Nag_Hammadi_Library "Nag Hammadi Library").
Nag Hammadi is a town in Upper Egypt near ancient Chenoboskion and
13 codices were discovered about 1945.

## General beliefs

The following information is taken from Olson,
*The Story of Christian Theology*, p. 37.

### Matter or materiality

Gnostics believed that matter, whether it be the physical universe
or the humanly body, is evil. It is obvious that there is a great
tension between spirit and matter. This effects many of their
beliefs and especially the way they perceive(d) the world and God's
interactions with it.

### God

God is wholly transcendent, that is, he is far removed from his
creation. He did not create the material universe because it was
instead created by an evil or lesser God, sometimes called a
"demiurge". God is thus too perfect and pure to have much to do
with the evilness of the material universe.

### Humanity

Gnostics believed that human beings were "sparks" or "droplets" of
the very same spiritual substance (or essence) that God is. Somehow
we we became trapped in our physical bodies from which we are to
escape.

### The Fall

All Gnostics agreed that The Fall was identical to the fall into
matter. In other words, creation and The Fall coincide. "As long as
spirits are trapped in physical bodies and materiality, they will
be subject to sin, which is caused by ignorance of their true
nature and home."

### Salvation

Gnosticism commonly held that "salvation is to escape from the
bondage of the material existence and travel back to the home from
which souls/spirits have fallen." God initiates salvation because
he wants to draw back the stray bits and pieces of himself, and so
he sends forth an emanation of himself - "a spiritual redeemer" -
who comes down from heaven and gives an attempt to teach some of
the "divine sparks of Spirit" what their true identity is and where
their real home lies. Once they are awakened by this redeemer they
can then begin their journey back home. "Salvation is by knowledge
- self-knowledge."

### Jesus

Lastly, as far as most scholars know, Gnostics considered
themselves Christians and saw Jesus as a heavenly messenger.
However, they rejected the idea of God becoming incarnate (God
becoming a man), dying and rising bodily. "These beliefs were
considered unspiritual and against true wisdom because they
entangled spirit with matter." Most Gnostics believe that whoever
entered Jesus at his baptism left him before he died on the cross.

## Gnosticism's present existence

This heretical view is still in existence today, both in various
secretive cults and in such pop religious movements as astrology or
alchemy.

The
[Masonic movement](index.php?title=Masonic_movement&action=edit&redlink=1 "Masonic movement (page does not exist)")
has been referred to as a Gnostic movement. The popular book
*[The Da Vinci Code](The_Da_Vinci_Code "The Da Vinci Code")* (2003,
Doubleday) by Dan Brown promotes Gnostic ideas as it attempts to
undermine orthodox Christianity.
