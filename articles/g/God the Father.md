To **God the Father** "is attributed the beginning of activity, and
the fountain and wellspring of all things".[^1] In
relation to [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), the
[Son of God](Son_of_God "Son of God"), and in relation to us united
with his Son, "*Father* is the proper name for God, and does not
merely describe what he is like".[^2] As
[John the Apostle](John_the_Apostle "John the Apostle") records, in
the words of the Lord, it is
[eternal life](Eternal_life "Eternal life") to know the Father,
"the only true God", and Jesus Christ whom he has
sent.[^3] To see how this confession of faith in "the
God and Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ" [^4]
necessarily implies [Trinitarianism](Trinity "Trinity") requires
fuller explanation from Scripture, and the wisdom which is given by
the Holy Spirit.[^5]

## Father as beginning

The Father created all things by His Word and Spirit; it is from
Him that His Son Jesus Christ came "for us and for our salvation"
(as the [Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") puts it) in the
power of the Holy Spirit; and, it is from Him that the Spirit of
His Son is sent into our hearts, crying out to God, "Abba! Father!"
[^6] Therefore, "in respect to order and degree, the
beginning *[principium or origo]* of divinity is in the
Father"[^7] It is the Father, in love and for our
salvation, who exalted Jesus Christ "far above all rule and
authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is
named, not only in this age but also in the one to come". It is the
Father who subjects all things to His Son, and "gave him as head
over all things to the church".[^8] It is in this sense
that the Father is sometimes referred to as the "first person" of
the [Holy Trinity](Holy_Trinity "Holy Trinity") â€” but this
terminology of "first" (and "second", and "third") is for
convenience only. It is not meant to imply that there ever has been
any God except the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Neither does it
imply that the Son or the Spirit, considered as it were
*in themselves*, are subtractable in any way or in any sense at
all. And finally, the Father confessed as the "beginning" of God
does not deny that, each one of these distinct Holy Persons is the
entirety of God, in every sense except the eternal distinction of
persons (*see [Perichoresis](Perichoresis "Perichoresis")*).

## Inherent Fatherhood

Besides being the creator and nurturer of creation by His Son and
Spirit, and the provider for his people as revealed in the Old
Testament, the New Testament presents God the Father in eternal
relation to his only Son, [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"), which implies an
exclusive and intimate familiarity that is of their very nature:
"No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the
Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal
him." (Matthew 11:27). In Christian theology, this is the
[revelation](Revelation_of_God "Revelation of God") that Fatherhood
is inherent to God's very [being](Being "Being").[^9]
Thus, in Christianity, God is not called Father by comparison to
mankind; rather family and fatherhood among men is called such by
comparison to God.[^10]

## An eternal life: sons to the Father

Although God may be said to be Father of all in the sense that he
is the Creator of all, the special personal relationship as father
is more restricted. God was the father of the nation Israel in the
Old Testament in that he chose to set his love on them and set them
apart from other nations and peoples. God is the father of
Christians in the sense that they are set apart by his sovereign
election and indwelt with his Spirit. Thus, Christians are called
*children of God* (cf. John 1:12) in a sense which does not apply
to all people.

Christians are made participants in the eternal relationship of
Father and Son, through Jesus Christ. Christians are *adopted*
children of God:

"But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His
Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were
under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. And
because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into
your hearts crying out, 'Abba, Father!' Therefore you are no longer
a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through
Christ." (Galatians 4:4-7)

## Worship: to the glory of God the Father

In his *Commentary on John*,
[Cyril of Alexandria](Cyril_of_Alexandria "Cyril of Alexandria")
states, "all things proceed from the Father, but wholly through the
Son in the Spirit". Thus, Christian worship, the fruit of
salvation, is a work of God enacted by the Father, accomplished by
the Son, and produced by the Holy Spirit. Therefore, Christian
worship is a communion with the Father which consists "in his
communication of himself unto us, *with our returnal unto him*" and
it flows "from that *union* which in Jesus Christ we have with
him".[^11] The Father is both, the origin and the
object of our worship of God through Jesus Christ and in the Holy
Spirit. When the Father is in this way the object of worship, the
Son and Spirit are not diminished, but properly glorified together
with the Father as one God; for the fullness of the Father and of
the Son dwells in the one Spirit given to
us.[^12] Therefore, when we by
humbling ourselves in the Holy Spirit glorify the name of Jesus
Christ, whom the Father has "highly exalted and bestowed on him the
name that is above every name", it is to the infinite glory of God
the Father through the Son in the Spirit.[^14]
