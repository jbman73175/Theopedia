**God** is the [triune](Trinity "Trinity") Supreme Being, the
sovereign Creator and Ruler of the universe, the principal Object
of the Christian faith. "From the biblical viewpoint it is
generally agreed that it is impossible to give a strict definition
of the idea of God," (*Evangelical Dictionary of Theology*, p.
501). This is because using finite language to define an infinite
God quickly proves inadequate.

Attempts have been made, however, to give a definition for Who and
What God is. [Anselm](Anselm "Anselm") said that God is "that than
which nothing greater is conceivable" and that he is "the supreme
Being." Yet, this does not begin to encompass what God has revealed
of himself in the [Bible](Bible "Bible") regarding his existence,
nature, character, purposes, and most significantly in the person
of [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"). The study of God is
[theology](Theology "Theology").

*"I AM who I AM." - Exodus 3:14*
*"The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us..." - Acts 17:24-27*

## The Trinity

The doctrine of the Trinity is a challenging and yet
[essential doctrine](Essential_doctrine "Essential doctrine") of
Christianity. It is essential because it is fundamental to God's
revelation of Himself and effects our understanding of all other
doctrines. It also distinguishes Christianity from all religions,
adding to the
[exclusive message of the gospel](Exclusivism "Exclusivism") that
was found on the very lips of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") (John 8:24).
Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand how there exists
[one God](Monotheism "Monotheism") and yet three persons. Since the
fourth-century (i.e., the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed")), the church has found
the explanation of the Trinity helpful when understanding
Scripture's affirmation of 'one God' and 'three distinct persons' -
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

*See main pages: [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"), [God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father"), [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit"), [Development of Trinitarian theology](Development_of_Trinitarian_theology "Development of Trinitarian theology"), [Trinitarian theology](Trinitarian_theology "Trinitarian theology")*
## Existence of God

Throughout the
[history of Christianity](Church_history "Church history") various
arguments have been proposed that seek to prove the existence of
God on rational grounds. Some have been made in response to
criticism, while others have been made to strengthen and even
defend one's faith. It is sometimes held, however, that the
existence of God cannot be proven because it is more basic to human
thought than any reasoning that could be used to prove it.

*See main page: [Arguments for the existence of God](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God "Arguments for the existence of God")*
## God's revelation

[Colin Gunton](Colin_Gunton "Colin Gunton") sheds light on the
attributes of God when he says, "we are concerned, rather, first of
all with who God is, not what we attribute to him... what we seek
are not our attributions but the ways in which God is perfect,"
^[[1]](#note-0)^. That is, we must be careful to not attribute
something to God that he has not revealed about himself. Gunton
concludes this idea by stating, "It is not a matter of what
*we attribute*, but of what he *reveals himself* to be," (ibid.,
emphasis in original). This statement reminds those who approach
the attributes of God to make sure that their conclusions are
grounded in Scripture where God has revealed himself most clearly.

*See main page: [Revelation of God](Revelation_of_God "Revelation of God")*
## God in history

From creation, the cross, and to the present, God has revealed
himself in history and will continue to do so. In the beginning,
God created the heavens and earth. Generations later he took
Abraham and made a people for himself. God made them his own, and
made covenants with them. Roughly two thousand years ago God
revealed himself preeminently in Jesus Christ, "the image of the
invisible God." Jesus Christ is the culmination of the revelation
of God, and His
[first coming](Incarnation_of_the_Son_of_God "Incarnation of the Son of God")
is the turning point of history. He is still at work today through
His Holy Spirit, preeminently as He works in His people to testify
of Jesus Christ.

*See main page: [Redemptive history](Redemptive_history "Redemptive history")*
## Can we know God?

Scripture states that we will never be able to fully comprehend God
and his ways (Isaiah 55:9; Job 11:7, 26:14, 37:5). However, the
Bible still says that we *can* know God (Jeremiah 9:23-24), and
most clearly through Jesus Christ (John 17:3; I John 5:20, I John
2:13). So although we may never know everything about God, we can
still comprehend what he has revealed to us through his creation,
the Scriptures, and his Son.

*See main page: [Knowability of God](Knowability_of_God "Knowability of God")*

## Character of God

To understand who God is or what he is like it is important to
study his attributes and identity. In general, "attribute" can be
understood as a quality or characteristic that makes a person who
they are. In Scripture, God's attributes are closely associated to
His name (see below). All of God's attributes are essential to who
He is, making him special and uniquely worthy of worship. Yet, some
attributes can be found or are imaged within humanity. To know the
attributes of God is to know God as He has revealed Himself in
Scripture.

*See main pages: [Attributes of God](Attributes_of_God "Attributes of God")*,
*[Divine simplicity](Divine_simplicity "Divine simplicity")*
## Titles and names of God

In the Western world names do not hold the significance they did in
the past. However, in biblical times, names carried a meaning.
Names could commemorate historical events, and even signified a
parent's hope for their child. In the Bible we find that God has
selected titles and names for Himself that reveal his nature and
character to us in ways that we can understand.
