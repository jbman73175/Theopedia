**God of the Gaps** arguments are a discredited and outmoded
approach to [apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics"), in which a
gap in scientific knowledge is used as evidence for the
[existence of God](Existence_of_God "Existence of God").

Before the scientific revolution of the last four centuries, such
arguments were commonplace and widely accepted, presumably because
the "gaps" were large and showing no signs of shrinking. A
lightning bolt crashes down, the peasants working in the field
cross themselves and say "well, we don't understand that, so it
must be God."

## Problems with God of the Gaps

From a philosophical point of view, the inherent problem with a God
of the Gaps apologetic is that it relegates God to only a portion
of creation — the portion that we don't understand yet. It places
the apologist at a disadvantage by ignoring how the underlying
patterns in the things we understand speak to the work of the
Creator God. It also denies, in effect, the Christian view of
science, which is that science is "thinking God's thoughts after
him"; it does this by suggesting that we can only see God in the
areas of nature which we do not understand, rather than seeing him
most clearly in those which we do understand.

From a pragmatic point of view, the main problem with a God of the
Gaps apologetic is that the gaps are getting smaller with every
passing year. No one felt this more keenly than Isaac Newton, a
religious man (in the end a [Deist](Deism "Deism")) who closed more
gaps than any other scientist. As recorded in the
*General Scholium*^[[1]](#note-0)^, Newton struggled to find a gap
big enough for God. He eventually settled on gravity's
*action at a distance*, unwilling to believe that a simple force
could act across vast empty spaces and penetrate to matter in the
center of the planets. That gap, of course, has long since
disappeared from classical and relativistic physics.

## Origin of the term

The earliest use of the term "God of the Gaps" was probably by
[Henry Drummond](index.php?title=Henry_Drummond&action=edit&redlink=1 "Henry Drummond (page does not exist)"),
a Scottish evangelist and close associate of
[D.L. Moody](Dwight_L._Moody "Dwight L. Moody"), who was renowned
for his endeavours to harmonize emerging scientific theories with
the gospel. Writing in 1894, Drummond was critical of those who
focused on what science did not yet know:

> There are reverent minds who ceaselessly scan the fields of Nature
> and the books of Science in search of gaps — gaps which they will
> fill up with God. As if God lived in the gaps? What view of Nature
> or of Truth is theirs whose interest in Science is not in what it
> can explain but in what it cannot, whose quest is ignorance not
> knowledge, whose daily dread is that the cloud may lift, and who,
> as darkness melts from this field or from that, begin to tremble
> for the place of His abode? What needs altering in such finely
> jealous souls is at once their view of Nature and of God. Nature is
> God's writing, and can only tell the truth; God is light, and in
> Him is no darkness at all.^[[2]](#note-1)^

[Bonhoeffer](Dietrich_Bonhoeffer "Dietrich Bonhoeffer"), who may
have read Drummond's book, used a similar term in a letter that he
wrote in 1944:

> ...how wrong it is to use God as a stop-gap for the incompleteness
> of our knowledge. If in fact the frontiers of knowledge are being
> pushed further and further back (and that is bound to be the case),
> then God is being pushed back with them, and is therefore
> continually in retreat. We are to find God in what we know, not in
> what we don't know; God wants us to realize his presence, not in
> unsolved problems but in those that are solved.^[[3]](#note-2)^

## God of the Gaps in theology and apologetics

Theologians and religious scientists have used God of the Gaps
arguments at least since the thirteenth century, revising them in
response to developments in science.

[Thomas Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") argued that
because there is order and predictability in inanimate objects,
which clearly cannot create order for themselves, there must be an
intelligent being ordering them:

> We see that things which lack knowledge, such as natural bodies,
> act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or
> nearly always, in the same way, so as to obtain the best result.
> Hence it is plain that they achieve their end, not fortuitously,
> but designedly. Now whatever lacks knowledge cannot move towards an
> end, unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and
> intelligence; as the arrow is directed by the archer. Therefore
> some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are
> directed to their end; and this being we call God. ^[[4]](#note-3)^

Isaac Newton, a [deist](Deism "Deism"), developed equations that
explained much of the order in inanimate objects, which challenged
Aquinas's God of the Gaps arguments. In response, Newton turned to
the *variety* that he saw in creation, as evidence for a creator:

> We know him only by his most wise and excellent contrivances of
> things, and final cause: we admire him for his perfections; but we
> reverence and adore him on account of his dominion: for we adore
> him as his servants; and a god without dominion, providence, and
> final causes, is nothing else but Fate and Nature. Blind
> metaphysical necessity, which is certainly the same always and
> every where, could produce no variety of things. All that diversity
> of natural things which we find suited to different times and
> places could arise from nothing but the ideas and will of a Being
> necessarily existing. ^[[5]](#note-4)^

[William Paley](index.php?title=William_Paley&action=edit&redlink=1 "William Paley (page does not exist)"),
writing more than a century after Newton, argued that the
*complexity* and obvious *design* of God's creation, and in
particular of living things, was irrefutable evidence for God's
existence:

> In crossing a heath, suppose I ... found a watch upon the ground,
> and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that
> place;... This mechanism being observed... the inference, we think,
> is inevitable, that the watch must have had a maker....who
> comprehended its construction, and designed its use.
> ^[[6]](#note-5)^

Not many years after Paley, Darwin offered an explanation that
undermined Paley's "argument from design." Many of those who had
based their faith on Paley's arguments found their faith severely
challenged. It was in this context that Drummond wrote "The Ascent
of Man" as quoted above.



## God of the Gaps in secular discourse

One frustration for Christian apologists is the tendency for
secular commentators, even well-respected ones, to assume that
Christian theology is based on God of the Gaps arguments. A typical
non-believing syllogism might proceed as follows:

-   "I note that Christians see God's hand in the wonders of
    creation"
-   "I can explain all observables without resorting to God-talk"
-   "therefore Christians are wrong to believe in God"

The logical
*[cum hoc ergo propter hoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cum_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc "w:Cum hoc ergo propter hoc")*
error, of course, is to think that Christians have faith *because*
they see God in creation. In general the reverse is the case:
Christians see God in creation *because they have faith* — the veil
has been lifted from their eyes and they can see God's hand in
everything (2 Cor 4:3-4).

Believing that faith is based on a God of the Gaps, sceptics try to
undermine faith by stitching up the gaps.

### Contemporary example

Stephen Hawking provides an example of this in his 1988 best seller
*A Brief History of Time*^[[7]](#note-6)^. In Chapter 8 "The Origin
and Fate of the Universe" he sets up a God of the Gaps
[strawman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strawman "w:strawman")
argument:

-   "In the hot big bang model ... the initial state of the
    universe would have to have had exactly the same temperature
    everywhere in order to account for the fact that the microwave
    background has the same temperature in every direction we look."
-   "It would be very difficult to explain why the universe should
    have begun in just this way, except as the act of a God who
    intended to create beings like us."

Hawking then introduces various Inflationary models of the
universe, and a "no-boundary" proposal that requires no singularity
at the big bang. With that cosmological gap thus closed, he
concludes:

-   "So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it
    had a creator. But if the universe is really completely
    self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither
    beginning nor end: it would simply be. What place then, for a
    creator?"
