**Gordon Haddon Clark** (1902-1985) was a philosopher and
[Calvinist](Calvinist "Calvinist")
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian") and taught
[philosophy](Philosophy "Philosophy") at the college level for most
of his life. He was an expert in pre-Socratic and ancient
philosophy and was noted for his rigor in defending Platonic
realism against all forms of empiricism, in arguing that all truth
is propositional, and in applying the laws of logic. The
[Trinity Foundation](http://www.trinityfoundation.org) continues to
publish his writings and other books as well.

"Gordon Clark was not primarily an apologist for the Christian
faith, but rather a professional philosopher critiquing what
secular philosophers have said concerning ultimate reality. Through
rigorous logic, he continually sought to evaluate and expose the
weaknesses of secular philosophy, and to espouse Christian theism
as dominantly superior. Although he touches on all areas of
philosophy in his works, he is predominately taken up with
understanding and evaluating thoughts about
[epistemology](Epistemology "Epistemology") – how it is that men
know, and how they know what they know." (Dr. C. Matthew McMahon

Gordon Clark early in his career
## Biographical sketch

Clark graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1924 with a
bachelor's degree and earned his PhD from the same institution in
1929. The following year, he did postgraduate work at the Sorbonne
in Paris.

He began teaching at the University of Pennsylvania and also taught
at Reformed Episcopal Seminary in Philadelphia. In 1936, he
accepted a professorship in philosophy at Wheaton College, where he
remained until 1944, at which time he accepted a position at Butler
University. In 1974, he left Butler and taught at several
institutions, including Covenant College in Lookout Mountain,
Georgia and Sangre de Cristo Seminary in Westcliffe, Colorado.

In 1944, Clark was ordained as a minister in the Orthodox
Presbyterian Church. Clark left the OPC in 1948 following what has
become known as the Clark-Van Til Controversy. He first changed to
the United Presbyterian Church of North America and later to the
Reformed Presbyterian Church. He died in 1985 and was buried in
Westcliffe, Colorado.

## The Clark-Van Til controversy

In 1943 Dr. Gordon H. Clark, who was to become one of the foremost
Christian philosopher of the twentieth century, sought ordination
in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, a small denomination barely
seven years old at that time.

Dr. Clark was immediately opposed by the faculty of Westminster
Theological Seminary, led by Professor
[Cornelius Van Til](Cornelius_Van_Til "Cornelius Van Til"). Despite
their zealous opposition, Dr. Clark was ordained by the OPC. In
1944 the Westminster Seminary faculty tried to remove Dr. Clark
from office, not by filing charges against him, but by arguing that
the procedure the OPC used to ordain him was irregular. They were
struggling, not merely to prevent Dr. Clark from gaining influence
in the denomination, but to retain their control of the Seminary as
well.

The related theological issues, revolving around the relation of
knowledge to the incomprehensibility of God, continue to resonate
in Christian philosophical discussions today.
