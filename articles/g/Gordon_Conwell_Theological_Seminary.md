**Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary** was formed in 1969 by the
merger of The Conwell School of Theology (predecessor to Temple
University in Philadelphia) and Gordon Divinity School (formerly
Boston Missionary Training School). The main campus is in South
Hamilton, MA, with an urban ministry campus in Boston, MA, and
satellite locations in Charlotte, NC, and Jacksonville, FL. Harold
J. Ockenga and [Billy Graham](Billy_Graham "Billy Graham") were
instrumental in establishing the evangelical, independent,
interdenominational seminary whose constituents are united in the
belief that the Bible is the infallible, authoritative Word of
God.
