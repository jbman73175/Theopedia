Richard Hays writes, 'Fee's book is the most comprehensive
treatment available of Paul's understanding of the Holy Spirit, a
topic that has rarely received sufficient attention in studies of
Pauline theology... Fee emphasizes insistently that the Holy Spirit
must be experienced as a living presence within the church. That
message is both faithful to Paul and urgent for the community of
faith in our time.'
