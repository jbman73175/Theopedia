The **Gospel** is the foundation of
[Christian theology](Christian_theology "Christian theology"),
setting it apart from other all other religions, particularly other
Judeo-Christian-Muslim traditions, by the manner in which it relays
the hope of [salvation](Salvation "Salvation"). The word *gospel*
originates from the meaning of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") Greek word
*evangelion* meaning "good news". This meaning was transmitted
literally into Old English as *godspell*, eventually becoming
*gospel*. The Gospel is epitomized by Jesus Christ in the following
proclamation: "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has
come near; repent, and believe in the *good news*." (Mark 1:15)

### Uses of "gospel"

The word *gospel* is used in various ways. Primarily it refers the
good news as defined above, that it is the proclamation of God in
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") that the
[kingdom of God](Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God") has come near and
that it is a call for the proper response of
[repentance](Repentance "Repentance").^[[1]](#note-0)^ It is a
proclamation that God has initiated the restoration of relationship
with his [creation](Creation "Creation").^[[2]](#note-1)^ This
proclamation embodies a host of implications found, as the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") explains, within the
reality of the nearness of God's kingdom. Some of the most
prominent of these implications are further explored within the
following subsections of this article.

*Gospel* also refers to a written narrative of the life, death and
resurrection of Jesus Christ. Such narratives are typically
entitled "Gospel of *[author's name]*". There are
[four Gospels](Four_Gospels "Four Gospels") in the New Testament,
which are the Gospels of:
[Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew"),
[Mark](Gospel_of_Mark "Gospel of Mark")
[Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke") and
[John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John"). The first three of these
are also called the
[Synoptic Gospels](Synoptic_Gospels "Synoptic Gospels"). Countless
non-canonical gospels, e.g.
[Gospel of Thomas](Gospel_of_Thomas "Gospel of Thomas"), have been
written from as early as the first century to the present day.

### The Gospel begins with Jesus Christ

The nearness of the kingdom begins with advent of Jesus Christ:
(Mark 1:1) After a prophetic preamble through which Mark connects
Jesus with the [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament")
prophecies of Isaiah regarding the coming of Lord, the story
immediately begins with the ministry of Jesus Christ, with his
first words being the quote given above: "The time is fulfilled,
and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the
*good news*." Jesus proclaims himself as the embodiment of the
kingdom of God having come near to humanity.

### The Gospel is Jesus bringing salvation to the world

Salvation within the gospel text is initially portrayed through
Jesus' many acts of healing, which begin within that same first
chapter of the Gospel of Mark. Healing is integral to the to the
kingdom of God having come near.^[[3]](#note-2)^

##### A New Reality Preached

Within the
[Beatitudes](index.php?title=Beatitudes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Beatitudes (page does not exist)")
Jesus begins to unpack the meaning of his proclamation of good news
by explaining reality from God's perspective: that it will not be
the present power-brokers (e.g. Rome, the Pharisees), but rather it
will be the powerless who inherit the future, who will be the
royalty of the kingdom of God (Matthew 5:3-11). This understanding
provides a message of hope, and even a call to rejoice, amidst
suffering, that the suffering of those who follow Jesus is not what
defines their story but rather the hope set before them by Jesus'
promise that God will rectify all that has gone wrong with creation
and save those who rest in that hope (Matthew
5:12).^[[4]](#note-3)^

##### The Cross & The Resurrection

The ultimate display of this hope is found in the
[Cross](index.php?title=Cross&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cross (page does not exist)")
of Jesus Christ and the [Resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection")
(Romans 5:1-10, 8:1-5, 15:1-8). As the Apostle Paul explains, Jesus
denies his advantage as almighty God and becomes a humble servant
of humanity, even to the point of permitting them to murder him on
a cross (Philippians 2:5-8). And yet, as Paul continues, "Therefore
God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above
every name" (v9). The powers and principalities of the world did
not have the final word over him but he was raised by God (Acts
2,3,4). This hope enabled him to continue towards Jerusalem,
towards the Cross (Luke 18:31-33).^[[5]](#note-4)^

##### Forgiveness of Sins

Repentance, forgiveness of sins and salvation; Luke 1:77, 24:47,
Acts 13:38, Ephesians 1:7, Colossians 1:14 ... The Apostle
[Paul](Paul "Paul"), in reminding the church at
[Corinth](index.php?title=Corinth&action=edit&redlink=1 "Corinth (page does not exist)")
of the meaning of the Gospel, he stresses salvation from Christ as
the forgiveness of sins: "Now I would remind you, brothers, of the
gospel I preached to you, ... that Christ died for our sins in
accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was
raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures". (1
Corinthians 15:1,3-4)
