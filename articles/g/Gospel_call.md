The **gospel call** is the call to obedience as well as faith.
[J. I. Packer](J._I._Packer "J. I. Packer") writes that "In our own
presentation of Christ's gospel, therefore, we need to lay a
similar stress as Christ did on the cost of following Christ, and
make sinners face it soberly before we urge them to respond to the
message of free forgiveness." ^[[1]](#note-0)^
