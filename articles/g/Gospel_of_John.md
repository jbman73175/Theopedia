John's content may be unique, he presents a different side of Jesus

## Author

The only internal clue to the authorship of Gospel is John
21:20-24, which attribute the source of the account to ‘the Beloved
Disciple’. ‘The Beloved Disciple’ is not named anywhere in the
Gospel, but he is mentioned a few key times; he is beside Jesus at
the last supper (John 13:22-25), is present at the crucifixion and
is told to care for Jesus’ mother (John 19:25-27) and sees the
empty tomb (John 20:1-8). The traditional identity of this disciple
is John the Apostle.
[w:Theophilus of Antioch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophilus_of_Antioch "w:Theophilus of Antioch")
(c. 170) quotes the prologue of the Gospel and attributes it to
John.^[[1]](#note-0)^ [Eusebius](Eusebius "Eusebius") of Caesarea
quotes [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") as saying that the disciple
John, ‘who reclined on his bosom’, wrote a Gospel in
[Ephesus](index.php?title=Ephesus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ephesus (page does not exist)").^[[2]](#note-1)^
The
[w: Muratorian fragment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muratorian_fragment "w:Muratorian fragment")
(c. 170) also attributes the Gospel to John the
Disciple.^[[3]](#note-2)^

There is no direct evidence that this John is the son of Zebedee,
and some scholars have suggested an alternative ‘John the Elder’.
However, there is no direct evidence for the existence of this
alternate John, and it is reasonable to assume that early church
writers would specify if ‘John the Disciple’ was different to ‘John
of Zebedee’, since the latter is so prominent in the Synoptic
Gospels.^[[4]](#note-3)^

One may accept the internal biblical data and the external evidence
as proof that John, son of Zebedee wrote the Gospel. However, one
may later change one's opinion like Raymond E. Brown, author of the
Anchor Bible commentary, who rescinded his earlier commentary
opinion: "I now recognize that the external and internal evidecne
are probably not to be harmonize" (Brown, 1979, p.
34).--[Rcnabi260](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=User:Rcnabi260&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Rcnabi260 (page does not exist)")

Anyway, we must admit there is, however, no direct scriptural
evidence that the author was John the disciple. We may conjecture
that the author connected with John the Baptist and the community,
itself. , only that it was a disciple who was very close to Jesus
and an eye-witness. Some scholars suggest that the disciple might
be Lazarus, who is the only male in the Gospel specifically
described as being loved by Jesus (John 11:3-5).^[[5]](#note-4)^
Additionally, the phrase “we know that his testimony is true” in
John 21:24 suggests that some form of editorial process has
occurred after the initial writing. One possibility is that 24b was
added on by the original community as a form of signature at the
end of the document. A second possibility is that the entire
chapter 21 was add to the original text (note the possible
conclusion at John 20:31), potentially to explain the death of the
‘Disciple whom Jesus Loved’, who was rumoured to never
die.^[[6]](#note-5)^

The convention is to talk about the author as ‘John the
Evangelist’, or just ‘John’, leaving open the question of whether
it is John the son of Zebedee, or another close disciple who is the
source and primary author of this Gospel.

## Date

There are two views concerning the date of John's Gospel:

\1) The traditional view places the writing of John around A.D. 85
 or later. This view is supported on two types of evidence.

First, we note that "indeed, the action of expulsion mEighay be
connected with the reformulation ca. A. D. 85 of one of the
Eighteen Benedictions (Shemoneh Esreh)which were recited in the
synagogues. The reformulation of the Twelfth Benediction involved a
curse on the minim, i.e., on deviators who seemiongly included the
Jewish Christians" (Brown, 1979, p.
22).--[Rcnabi260](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=User:Rcnabi260&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Rcnabi260 (page does not exist)")
23:48, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

Second, this view is supported by a statement from
[Clement of Alexandria](Clement_of_Alexandria "Clement of Alexandria")
that John wrote to supplement the other Gospel accounts. This would
place his writings later in the first-century, considering the
traditional view that the other Gospel writers wrote before A.D.
70. It is also argued that John's theology appears more developed,
giving suspicion for a later date.

\2) Recently, interpreters have suggested an earlier date,
 somewhere around A.D. 50 but no later than A.D. 70. It is argued
 that this view does not contradict Clement's statement.
 Furthermore, a more developed theology does not imply a later date.
 For example, the theology of
 [Romans](Epistle_to_the_Romans "Epistle to the Romans") is very
 developed, nevertheless it is dated around A.D. 57. Lastly,
 attention is given to [John 5:2](John_5#2 "John 5") where John uses
 "is" rather than "was" concerning the pool near the Sheep Gate.
 This may suggest a time before 70 when Jerusalem was destroyed.

## Purpose

“Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of His disciples
that are not written in this book. But these are written so that
you may believe Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and by
believing you may have life in His name.” (John 20:30-31 HCSB)

John 20:30-31 gives a starting point for considering the purpose
for John’s writing this Gospel. Clearly, believing in Jesus is the
source of salvation. Not only that, but believing certain facts
about Jesus – that he is the [Christ](Christ "Christ") (or
[Messiah](Messiah "Messiah")) who is the Son of God. In the “upper
room discourse” (chapters 13-17), Jesus give a wide description of
the nature of faith, which includes obeying Jesus’ commands (John
14:12, 15, 21-24, 15:10), loving each other (John 13:33-34;
15:12-17) and proclaiming the message of Jesus (John 15:26-27).
This is a strong theme throughout the whole Gospel (see *Themes*
below).

However, there is a question over the verb “believe” (πιστευω,
pisteuo). Ancient witnesses are evenly divided between two tenses
of the verb - aorist active and present active. The former implies
starting to believe, whilst the other implies continuing to
believe.^[[7]](#note-6)^ Thus the purpose of John could either have
been purely evangelistic, telling people about Jesus so that they
may come to believe, or for edification of Christians, reminding
them about Jesus so that they might continue to believe in him.

The narrative and theological distinctiveness of John from the
Synoptics leads many scholars to consider not just *why* John was
written, but why it was written *so differently*. Outside of the
passion narratives, there are remarkably few common events with the
Synoptics. This suggests that he was aware of the other three and
deliberately wrote a complementary Gospel to add extra information
and reflection rather than reiterate the existing content.
[Eusebius](Eusebius "Eusebius") quotes
[Clement](index.php?title=Clement&action=edit&redlink=1 "Clement (page does not exist)")
stating something similar:

But, last of all, John, perceiving that the external facts had been
made plain in the Gospel, being urged by his friends, and inspired
by the Spirit, composed a spiritual Gospel.^[[8]](#note-7)^
John 7:42 gives an interesting addition to this theory. The crowds
are clearly expecting the Messiah to have come from Bethlehem,
which is founded in scripture (Mic 5:2). However, John does not
clarify the fact that Jesus did indeed come from Bethlehem. It is
quite possible that John expected his readers to know this fact,
and to understand the irony of the crowd’s
deliberation.^[[9]](#note-8)^ This suggests that John was writing
pastorally to existing Christians, to keep them strong in their
faith.

Chapters 13-17 also support the theory that John wrote to
Christians. The “upper room discourse” is a pastoral speech to
people who follow Jesus. They are described as branches coming from
him, and as being united with him as he is to God (John 15:1-17).
They are also called to self-sacrificial love for each other and
obedience to Jesus’ commands (John 13:33-34; 14:12, 15, 21-24;
15:10-17). Thirdly, Jesus warns them of the persecutions that they
will face once he leaves (his death, resurrection and ascension)
and encourages them to stand firm in the faith throughout them
(John 15:18-23; 16:1-4). Finally he promises them the support of
the Holy Spirit who will comfort and guide them in their
persecution, and will teach them and lead them into all truth
concerning Jesus (John 14:15-27; 16:5-15). This extensive passage
seems to be directed to pastoral care for existing Christians who
are currently, or about to face persecution.

However, there is also support for the theory that John was an
evangelistic book. The Gospel has a very strong theme of judgement
and witness, which is highlighted by the many characters (including
“the crowds”) who are considering who Jesus is. As the Gospel
narrative develops, there are many witnesses to who Jesus is, and
many people choose to follow Jesus while many others choose to
reject him. This is highlighted by the court cases where Jesus is
unjustly condemned, and by his resurrection which vindicates him –
and vindicates all the people who chose to follow him. However,
through the Gospel, the theme of judging Jesus is constantly
subverted as Jesus proclaims that he is the Judge (or that his Word
is the Judge). This shows that, rather than judging about Jesus,
the people are judged based on their decision about Jesus. Those
who follow him are vindicated while those who reject him are
judged. This shows a very strong evangelistic edge to the
gospel.^[[10]](#note-9)^

Of course, there is no need to present an either-or situation. Even
though parts of the Gospel seem to be clearly written with
Christians in mind, any account of who Jesus is acts as an
evangelistic tool.^[[11]](#note-10)^ It is important to note that
the most quoted and translated evangelistic passage in history
(John 3:16) comes from this Gospel.

Other parts of the gospel raise the question of what secondary
purposes the Gospel has. The first part of the Gospel has an
unusually large focus on the shift from John the Baptist to Jesus,
as John’s disciples and followers leave him to follow Jesus. The
Baptist’s statement in John 3:30 is the pinnacle of a theme
introduced in the Prologue – that John is not the Messiah, simply a
witness to him (John 1:8, 19, 27). This raises the possibility that
John the Evangelist was aware of some form of “Baptist cult” and
was deliberately targeting it as part of his purpose in writing the
Gospel. Equally, part of the final chapter seems interested in
explaining why a rumour, that the “disciple whom Jesus loved” would
not die, is not true (John 21:22-23). This section could have been
written in light of the death of this disciple (see *Author*
above).

## Relationship to the [Synoptic Gospels](Synoptic_Gospels "Synoptic Gospels")

### Narrative Differences

The narrative of the Gospel of John is different from the Synoptic
Gospels in a number of ways.^[[12]](#note-11)^ Very few of the
events which are common in the Synoptics are present in John, and
John contains many incidents which are not in the Synoptics. Some
of the major narrative events which John does not relate are Jesus’
birth, baptism, and temptation, Gethsemane, and Jesus' Ascension.
There are also very few miracle and healing accounts in John, and
no healings of those who are possessed by evil spirits. John also
includes miracles that the Synoptics do not such as the Wedding at
Cana (John 2:1-11) and the resurrection of Lazarus (John 11). The
only two miracles that are certainly the same as Synoptic events
are the feeding of the 5000 (John 6:1-14) and Jesus walking on
water (John 6:15-21), although a number of healings are similar to
Synoptic accounts (John 4:46-54, 5:1-18, 9:1-7).

In general, John does not have the same emphasis on the many acts
of Jesus that the Synoptics do. Instead there is an emphasis on the
teachings of Jesus, with some very lengthy discourses recorded.
With this emphasis, it is surprising that John contains no
parables, which are one of the most common methods of Jesus’
teaching in the Synoptics. Nor does John include the Sermon on the
Mount or any of Jesus other ethical ‘sayings’. Instead, Jesus'
speeches tend to revolve around himself and his identity. The
account of the
[Last Supper](index.php?title=Last_Supper&action=edit&redlink=1 "Last Supper (page does not exist)")
does not have the “communion” speech of the Synoptics (ie. Mark
14:22-25). Instead, there is a description of Jesus washing the
disciples’ feet, and a very long discourse from him comforting the
disciples and foreshadowing the coming of the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") at
[Pentecost](Pentecost "Pentecost").

The narrative arc of John is also different to the Synoptics. John
portrays Jesus’ ministry as being three years long, and covering
three separate
[Passover](index.php?title=Passover&action=edit&redlink=1 "Passover (page does not exist)")
festivals (John 2:13, 6:4, 19:14) while the Synoptics only describe
one Passover. In John, Jesus’ ministry alternates between Jerusalem
and Galilee a few times (see Structure), while the Synoptics
describe a period of ministry in Galilee followed by a single
journey to Jerusalem where Jesus dies. John also portrays a number
of events in a different sequence to the Synoptics, most notably
with Jesus clearing the temple at the start of his ministry, not
the end (John 2:12-25 cf. Mark 11:12-19).

The passion narrative is also remarkably different. Jesus stands
before Annas as well as Ciaphas at trial, and not the Sanhedrin.
The trial before Pilate is very different, and Jesus holds a long
conversation with Pilate. Details of the crucifixion are different
or new; Jesus carries his own cross, he asks for a drink, his side
is pierced by a spear and his final words – “it is finished” – are
different. Finally, John includes very different resurrection
narratives.

### Theological Differences

*This is a **[section stub](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theopedia_sectionstubs "Category:Theopedia sectionstubs")**. Please edit it to add information.*
The theological themes of John are discussed in more detail below,
but there are some notable differences with the theology of the
Synoptic Gospels. The most obvious is the very clear and ‘high’
Christology, where Jesus is clearly shown to be divine, and he
makes claims to divinity and authority that are much stronger than
those in the Synoptics. John shows little evidence of the
[messianic secret](index.php?title=Messianic_secret&action=edit&redlink=1 "Messianic secret (page does not exist)")
that the Synoptics display, and the people’s discussion of whether
Jesus is the Messiah, and his admission of that fact, form a key
structure to the narrative.

### Similarities

Regardless of these differences, there are many similarities
between John and the Synoptics. The general narrative arcs are the
same; Jesus is baptized by John, teaches, performs miracles and
healings, feeds 5000, walks on water, travels to Jerusalem, enters
triumphantly, has a final meal with his disciples where he teaches
them, is betrayed by Judas, tried by the Jews and Pilate, executed
between two others and rises from the dead. Additionally, Jesus is
shown to fulfill OT scripture, is declared to be the Messiah and
calls himself the Son of Man. The general principle of his teaching
is the same, as is the reason for and meaning of his death and
resurrection.



## Structure

It is generally accepted that John is divided into two halves,
chapters 1-12 and chapters 13-21. Raymond Brown described these
halves as 'The Book of Signs' and 'the Book of
Glory'.^[[13]](#note-12)^ These terms are the most common
descriptions for the two halves today. Beyond this, there are many
more detailed break-downs of the structure, the most varied are the
arrangement of the contents of the 'Book of Signs'. Many scholars
have highlighted the various elements of this section, including
the geographical locations, signs, "I am" sayings and festivals,
and have divided the "Book of Glory" up based on them. However,
none of these schemes fully account for many the parallels and
concentric structures found in the book. The table below sketches
out the main events in the Book of John, and highlights a few of
the main structural clues. ^[[14]](#note-13)^

## Themes

### Dualism

#### Light and darkness, day and night

"I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in
me may not remain in darkness." (12:46) Jesus is the light of the
world. Those who enjoy the presence of the light are to, as Jesus
exhorts, make the most of his presence and follow him. Only then
will they have the "light of life". The presence of the light of
Christ allows for a special work. "We must work the works of him
who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can
work." (9:4; cf. 1:4-9, 3:19, 9:5, 11:9-10, 12:46) It is of note
that Nicodemus comes in the night, and Judas betrays Jesus in the
night.

### I AM statements

Jesus is found frequently in John's Gospel with "I AM" statements
(cf. Exodus 3:14).

-   "I am the bread of life" (John 6:35)
-   "I am the light of the world" ( John 8:12; 9:5)
-   "I am the gate for the sheep" (John 10:7, 9)
-   "I am the good shepherd" (John 10:14)
-   "I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25)
-   "I am the way and the truth and the life" (John 14:6)
-   "I am the true vine" (15:1, 5)

### Belief

From the very outset one is called to believe (1:7) and John ends
his gospel stating that his purpose in writing it is that his
readers would believe (20:31). No other gospel accentuates belief
like John's. The Greek verb used for belief, *pisteuō*
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#4100](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=4100&version=nas)]*^)
is found 98 times in his gospel. It is no coincidence that he uses
the verb form so often. This points to the fact that
[faith](Faith "Faith") is an action (just as a verb is), and John
uses it to reiterate to his readers that belief does not remain
stagnant. It is alive and dynamic, bearing fruit and abiding in
Christ (15:1-11).

### The "hour"

The narrator noted Jesus' reference to the "hour" (John 2:4; 7:30;
8:20; 12:23, 27; 13:1; and 17:1). From these references we note
that the "hour" referred to Jesus' glorification through his death,
burial, and resurrection.

### Sabbath

### Eternal life

*See main page: [Eternal life](Eternal_life "Eternal life")*
### Signs

Miracles in the Gospel of John are referred to as "signs", pointers
to the identity of Christ as the one sent by the Father. Some
scholars identify John 2-11 as the "book of signs". Just as there
are seven "I am statements" there are also seven signs.

-   Turned water into wine (2:1-11)
-   Heal's an official's son (4:46-54)
-   Healed a lame man (5:1-18)
-   Fed 5,000 (6:1-14)
-   Jesus walks on water (6:16-21)
-   Gave sight to a blind man (9:1-41)
-   Raised Lazarus from the dead (11:1-57)

### Christology

*This is a **[section stub](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theopedia_sectionstubs "Category:Theopedia sectionstubs")**. Please edit it to add information.*
There are many ways of examining John's teaching about the nature
of Jesus The two main methods are to consider the titles and ways
that John refers to Jesus, and to consider the evidence supporting
Jesus' humanity and his divinity in the Gospel

#### Titles of Jesus

-   [Son of God, Son of Man and 'the Son'](Sonship_in_the_Gospel_of_John "Sonship in the Gospel of John")
-   The
    [Messiah](Messiah_in_the_Gospel_of_John "Messiah in the Gospel of John")

#### Humanity and Divinity of Jesus
