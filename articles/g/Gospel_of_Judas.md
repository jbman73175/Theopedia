The **Gospel of Judas** is part of an ancient Coptic (Egyptian)
codex which dates from around the third century AD. Although
discovered in the 1970s, the portion called the *Gospel of Judas*
has only recently been restored and translated by scholars.

The completion of the restoration and translation was announced by
the National Geographic Society at a news conference in Washington,
D.C. on April 6, 2006, and the manuscript itself was unveiled then
at the National Geographic Society headquarters, accompanied by a
television special entitled The Gospel of Judas on April 9, 2006,
which was aired on the National Geographic Channel.

The language of the codex containing the Gospel of Judas is the
same Sahidic dialect of Coptic as the
[gnostic](Gnosticism "Gnosticism")
[Nag Hammadi Library](Nag_Hammadi_Library "Nag Hammadi Library"),
discovered in Egypt in 1945. The Codex has three parts: an Epistle
to Philip that is ascribed to Peter (a variant is in the Nag
Hammadi collection), the Revelation of Jacob (also known from Nag
Hammadi), and the Gospel of Judas. Up to a third of the codex is
currently illegible.

The Gospel of Judas contains gnostic ideas and claims to bring new
information to the relationship between [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") and
[Judas Iscariot](Judas_Iscariot "Judas Iscariot"). "Unlike the
accounts in the canonical Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
in which Judas is portrayed as a reviled traitor, this newly
discovered Gospel portrays Judas as acting at Jesus' request when
he hands Jesus over to the authorities." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

The Gospel of Judas was known among some of the early Christians of
the second century. [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus"), Bishop of
Lyons, denounced it by name in his influential work,
*Against Heresies* i.31.1:

It is quite possible that the document Irenaeus referred to was
actually the source for this Coptic document. Early Gnostic
teaching spawned numerous writings which were clearly viewed as
spurious and heretical by the early church. A large portion of
these writings practiced
[pseudonymity](Pseudonymity "Pseudonymity"), where those with
little authority used an authoritative name (e.g., a disciple) to
bolster their writings acceptance.

## Background

The only known manuscript to include the text of the
*Gospel of Judas* surfaced in the 1970s, after 1700 years in the
desert of Egypt as a leather-bound papyrus manuscript. The papyri
on which the Gospel is written are fragmentary with some sections
missing, in some cases scattered words, in others many lines. This
is most likely due to the wear and tear associated with the
elements and the passage of time. According to Rodolphe Kasser, the
codex originally contained 62 pages; but when it came to the market
in 1999, only 26 pages remained because individual pages had been
removed and put up for sale. From time to time, these missing pages
appear and are identified.

### Recent developments

Through the decades the manuscript was offered about, very quietly,
but no major library felt ready to purchase a manuscript that had
such questionable provenance. Switzerland-based antiquities dealer
Frieda Nussberger-Tchacos bought the codex in April 2000 - though
its full contents remained a mystery - and eventually the
leatherbound codex was purchased by the Maecenas Foundation in
Basel, a private foundation directed by lawyer Mario Jean Roberty.

The existence of the text was made public by Rodolphe Kasser at a
conference of Coptic specialists in Paris, July 2004. In a March
2005 statement, a spokesman for the Maecenas Foundation announced
plans for edited translations into English, French and German, once
the fragile papyrus had undergone conservation by a team of
specialists in Coptic history led by a former professor at the
University of Geneva, Rodolphe Kasser, and that their work would be
published "in about a year." A. J. Tim Jull, director of the
National Science Foundation Arizona AMS laboratory, and Gregory
Hodgins, assistant research scientist, announced that a radiocarbon
dating procedure had dated five samples from the 62-page
leather-bound papyrus manuscript from 220 to 340 in January of 2005
at the University of Arizona.^[[2]](#note-1)^ This puts the Coptic
manuscript in the third or fourth centuries, a century earlier than
had originally been thought from analysis of the script. In January
2006, Gene A. Ware of the Papyrological Imaging Lab of Brigham
Young University conducted a multispectral imaging process on the
texts in Switzerland, and confirmed their
authenticity.^[[3]](#note-2)^
