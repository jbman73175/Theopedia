## Authorship

### Identity

Traditionally, the [Luke](Luke "Luke") of Colossians 4:14 and
Philemon 24.

### Luke's aims

Luke's own opening tells his recipient that his intent was to
"write an orderly account" in order that the reader might "know the
certainty of the things [he has] been taught."
([Luke 1:1-4](http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=luke%201:1-4&version=31),
NIV) However, Luke is not writing simply as an historian. As the
section "Themes" below will explore, Luke is also writing with a
keen eye on the theological aspects of the life of Jesus, seeking
to proclaim a particular message in his account.

## Themes

### Jesus, friend of outcasts

Luke, a Gentile doctor, writing for Gentiles and with a concern for
the sick, is particularly concerned to show Jesus' dealings with
Gentiles, lepers and other medical outcasts, despised tax
collectors, and many others. We meet Jesus as one to whom the
social boundaries of polite society were irrelevant, and who is
himself relevant to people from all backgrounds.

### Jewish roots and the Temple

In a careful counter-point to his view of Jesus as reaching out to
those whom contemporary Jewish society rejected, Luke emphasises
the Jewishness both of Christ and the Jewish roots of the early
church, as well as having a focus on the Temple. His gospel starts
with Zechariah in the Temple; he quotes Mary's song, with its links
to Hannah's prayer in
[1 Samuel](Books_of_Samuel "Books of Samuel"); and he recounts two
separate incidents in the life of Jesus, set in the Temple. He
closes the account of his gospel with the disciples staying
"continually at the temple, praising God."
([Luke 24:53](http://bible.gospelcom.net/passage/?search=luke%2024:53&version=31),
NIV)

## Relationship to other biblical books

### Matthew and Mark

The [synoptic problem](Synoptic_problem "Synoptic problem") is the
issue raised by literary similarities and differences between
[Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew")'s,
[Mark](Gospel_of_Mark "Gospel of Mark")'s and Luke's gospels.

## Acts

The book of [Acts](Acts_of_the_Apostles "Acts of the Apostles")
plainly sets itself forth as having been written by the same author
as Luke's gospel and to the same person. In many senses, it
functions as a sequel to Luke's gospel, and seems to share some
narrative structures.
