The **Gospel of Mark** is the second of the four gospels in the New
Testament, written by John Mark to Gentile Christians in Rome as an
evangelism and discipleship manual. It recounts many of the events
of Jesus' life in narrative fashion and focuses significant
attention on the final week of His passion in Jerusalem.

## Author

Strictly speaking, the work is anonymous, in that no claim of
authorship is inherently made within the letter itself. However,
there is evidence both in Scripture and in history to support John
Mark, cousin of Barnabas (Colossians 4:10), early traveling
companion of Paul (Acts 12:25), and spiritual son of Peter (I Peter
5:13) as the author of the gospel.

### Internal Evidence

The non-literary writing style and syntactical features probably
indicate that the author's first language was not Greek, but rather
a Semitic language such as Aramaic ^[[1]](#note-0)^. The author
also includes vivid details that are unnecessary to the flow of the
narrative, an indication that the author is writing from eyewitness
accounts ^[[2]](#note-1)^. These factors can be interpreted as
consistent with the traditional view that Mark, a Palestinian Jew,
wrote the gospel using Peter as his source.

### External Evidence

The internal evidence is corroborated by early attestations,
including an ancient caption ("according to Mark"), and testimony
by Papias, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of
Alexandria, and Origen ^[[3]](#note-2)^. The nearly universal
acceptance of Mark as the author of the gospel in light of the fact
that he was neither an apostle nor a hero in the first century
church lends credence to the validity of the traditional claim that
John Mark wrote the gospel which bears his name.

## Audience

### Internal Evidence

The explanation of Jewish customs (e.g., 7:3; 14:12; 15:42) and the
translation of Aramaic expressions into Greek (e.g., 3:17; 5:41;
7:11, 34; 9:43; 10:46; 14:36; 15:22, 34) indicate that they
probably were not Aramaic-speaking Jews (Wallace, 1998). Referring
to four watches of the night (6:48; 13:35), Mark also employs a
Roman system of time instead of the traditional Jewish three
^[[4]](#note-3)^. The inclusion of transliterated Latin terms in
reference to the military (e.g. *legion* in 5:9; *praetorium* in
15:16; *centurion* in 15:39), the courts (e.g. *speculator* in
6:27; *flagellare* in 15:15), and commerce (e.g. *denarius* in
12:15; *quadrans* in 12:42) implies a Roman destination, as Latin
speakers would have been found most readily there ^[[5]](#note-4)^.
Additionally, it is likely that the identification of Alexander and
Rufus as the sons of Simon the Cyrene (15:21) is because these men
were known to Mark's intended recipients -- Roman Christians
(Romans 16:13).

### External Evidence

There is also substantial external, direct evidence to suggest that
the intended readers were Roman Christians. Peter and Mark are
believed to have been together in Rome (2 Timothy 4:11, 1 Peter
5:13) where Clement of Alexandria and Irenaeus locate the writing
of the gospel ^[[6]](#note-5)^. Eusebius also claims that Papias
wrote that Mark composed his gospel for Peter's hearers in Rome
^[[7]](#note-6)^. Though it is impossible to be sure about the
composition date, evidence points to the latter part of the seventh
decade, likely after Peter's martyrdom in AD 64, but probably
before the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 ^[[8]](#note-7)^. If
he wrote in Rome, either while there with Peter, or perhaps shortly
after Peter's death, then Mark probably was writing for the Roman
Christians, and possibly to address the crisis in the church around
the intense persecution that was beginning to be directed at them
during this time.

## Purpose

According to the apostle Paul, every word of Scripture is inspired
and "is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and
for training in righteousness" (2 Timothy 3:16). It follows that
God would have caused Mark to write a narrative not merely to
chronicle a series of events, but rather to build a theological
argument allowing the man of God to "be competent, equipped for
every good work" (2 Timothy 3:17). Two of the other gospel writers
elucidate their reasons explicitly within their text -- Luke states
his intent "to write an orderly account" that you may have
certainty concerning the things you have been taught" (Luke 1:3-4),
and John explains that "these are written so that you may believe
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you
may have life in his name" (John 20:31). Mark, however leaves only
implicit clues as to his main purpose for writing.

Mark's gospel is characterized by action, vividly portraying the
non-stop work of Jesus, making frequent use the Greek adverb
meaning *immediately* or *straightway* and the conjunction
translated as *and*, *also*, or *even* to tie events together, and
giving miracles a prominent place in the record ^[[9]](#note-8)^.
His abundant use of the historical present tense, peppered with
many personal touches, leaves the impression that the story is
unfolding before the reader's eyes. Mark is careful not only to
record the human emotions of Jesus - compassion (1:41, 6:34, 8:2),
sighing (7:34; 8:12), indignation (3:5; 10:14), and distress
(14:33-34) - but to pay attention to reactions of people around Him
- amazement (1:27), criticism (2:7), fear (4:41), astonishment
(7:37), and bitter hatred (14:1). He also documents over a hundred
different questions, many of them asked of Jesus and even more
asked by Him. After inquiring about others' opinion He asks, "But
who do you say that I am?" (8:27). It could be said that Mark wrote
his gospel to invoke a response from his readers to this most
important question of all.

Mark thrusts his theological premise before his readers in the very
first verse, declaring it to be the *beginning*, *origin*, or
*basis* of the gospel, asserting that Jesus is not just the
long-awaited Jewish Messiah, but the very Son of God. He then
portrays Jesus as a sympathetic man, identifying with men,
demonstrating compassion for them, and sharing their sufferings.
The author devotes a significant portion of his text to the
mutually supporting ministries of service and suffering. Two
pivotal verses serve as bookends to the central section of the book
in which Jesus first lays down the demanding standard of
discipleship: "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself
and take up his cross and follow me" (8:34). He wraps up a series
of three passion predictions by reasserting the standard with
Himself as the model: "For even the Son of Man came not to be
served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many"
(10:45).

Through his candidly persuasive writing style, his deeply
provocative questions, and his dramatic portrayal of the Suffering
Servant, Mark leaves little room for the reader to miss his point.
His Gentile audience in Rome would no doubt have identified with
the themes he develops, being drawn into the story and forced to
draw a conclusion about Jesus. If they agreed with their countryman
who declared at the foot of the cross, "Truly this man was the Son
of God!" (15:39), they would then need to determine what to do with
Him. Much more than a rudimentary recounting of the events
surrounding Jesus, Mark's gospel can be seen as a clarion call for
evangelism and discipleship. The argument of the book will
therefore be traced to follow his purpose: Mark discloses the Son
of Man as a compassionate savior through His acts of service and
acts of suffering to summon unbelievers to become disciples and so
that believers would understand what it means to be committed
followers of Jesus.
