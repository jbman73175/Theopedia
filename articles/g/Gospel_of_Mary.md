The **Gospel of Mary**, or the
**Gospel According to Mary Magdalene** is a document dated between
120-180 AD. Not included in the [Bible](Bible "Bible"), the text
includes [gnostic](Gnosticism "Gnosticism") ideas - teachings
declared as heresy by early Christians such as
[Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus").

The Gospel of Mary was part of the discovery of the
[Nag Hammadi Library](Nag_Hammadi_Library "Nag Hammadi Library") in
1945. The text was originally written in [Greek](Greek "Greek") of
which two fragments from the third century have survived. A more
full, yet incomplete Coptic text from the fifth century exists, but
no one has yet found an entire manuscript.

"The Gospel of Mary exalts Mary Magdalene over the male disciples
of Jesus."^[[1]](#note-0)^


## Quotes

-   "All natures, all formed things, all creatures exist in and
    with one another and will again be resolved into their own roots,
    because the nature of matter is dissolved into the roots of its
    nature alone."
-   "When the soul had overcome the third power, it went upwards
    and saw the fourth power, (which) took seven forms. The first form
    is darkness, the second desire, the third ignorance, the fourth is
    the excitement of death, the fifth is the kingdom of the flesh, the
    sixth is the foolish wisdom of flesh, the seventh is the wrathful
    wisdom. These are the seven {powers} of wrath."
