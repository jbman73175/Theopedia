## Author

We note two approaches for determining the authorship of Matthew.
We may approach the authorship by assigning the authorship based on
second century early church fathers, who unanimously believed that
Matthew, one of the twelve apostles, was the author. In this
approach the author was Matthew, a tax-collector among the Twelve,
wrote either the Gospel or a collection of the Lord’s sayings in
Aramaic. Some who reject this picture allow that something written
by Matthew may have made its way into the present Gospel” (Brown,
1997 p. 172). Or we may approach the authorship by examining
internal evidence. In regards to the second approach, internal
evidence suggest that the author was “a Greek-speaker, who knew
Aramaic or Hebrew or both and was not an eyewitness of Jesus’
ministry, drew on Mark and a collection of the sayings of the
Lord—sayings whose origin is unknown [hence we refer to this
unknown source as “Q,” as well as on other available traditions,
oral or written. Probably a Jewish Christian” (Brown, 1997l p.
172).

According to the former approach, we note the dubious or uncertain
nature of Church tradition that identifiesthe author as Matthew,
whose name appears eighth in Matthew’s list with the title,
“publican” (i.e., “tax collector” [Mt. 10:3]); seventh in the list
of Mark (3:18) and Luke (6:17), and eighth in Acts (1:13). The
publican of 10:3 is in connection with 9:9, where “Matthew” serves
in lieu of “Levi” of mark 2:14 (=Luke 5:27). To be sure, the title
“According to Matthew” was assigned to the gospel during the second
century C. E. Papias stated: “Matthew arranged in order the sayings
in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted/translated as he
was able” (qtd in Brown, 1997, p. 209). The “kata” (meaning
“according to”) does not affirm authorship. It means “drawn up
according to the teachings of.” Since Church Fathers usually used
an apostolic name to grant authority, they chose an obscure
“publican” for an audience of Gentile predominance where tradition
had been blended with legend, and when the ethical teachings of
Jesus was being reinterpreted. Matthew could have collected a
source not connect to Mark or Luke (an unknown source). Anyway, the
name may be just a substitute rendering of “Levi,” or some
non-descript publican who was sitting at a
table.--[Rcnabi260](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=User:Rcnabi260&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Rcnabi260 (page does not exist)")

## Date

Due to Matthew's strong Jewish characteristics, some scholars date
his Gospel around the early part of A.D. 50 when the church was
largely Jewish and the gospel was preached to the Jews only (cf.
Acts 11:19). Again, others who find that Matthew (and even Luke)
were dependent upon Mark usually date his Gospel later, anywhere
between A.D. 65-75.

## Purpose

Matthew's main purpose is to prove that Jesus is the fulfillment of
the OT predictions concerning the Messiah. All of the Gospel
writers quote the OT, however Matthew has nine OT proof-texts that
are unique to his Gospel (Matt. 1:22-23; 2:15; 2:17-18; 2:23;
4:14-16; 8:17; 12:17-21; 13:35; 27:9-10).

It has also been observed that Matthew seems to group his material
around blocks of material suited for instruction, so that Jesus'
actions and other concerns seem less prominent in his overall
purpose.

## Themes

Matthew's theme is that Jesus was indeed the promised Messiah of
the nation of Israel, as his frequent tying in of material with the
Old Testament indicates. He specifically ties Jesus of Nazareth in
with the promised descendant of David, which would have been
crucial for Jewish readers of his day.

Thus Matthew's portrait of Jesus Christ is focused upon Him as the
Lion of Judah more than as, for example, the suffering Servant or
the preexistent Logos. As the genealogy of Jesus in the first
chapter indicates, Matthew is anxious to tie in the Son of God with
a real person born of the Royal Line of David.
