The **Gospel of Philip** is one of the texts of the New Testament
[apocrypha](Apocrypha "Apocrypha"). In a similar manner to the
[Gospel of Thomas](Gospel_of_Thomas "Gospel of Thomas"), it is a
*sayings gospel*, a collection of wise sayings, purportedly of
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus").

The text's misleading title is modern; the only connection with
[Philip the Apostle](Philip_the_Apostle "Philip the Apostle") is
that he is the only apostle mentioned (at 73,8). The text makes no
claim to be from Philip.
