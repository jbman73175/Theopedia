The **Gospel of Thomas**, completely preserved in a papyrus Coptic
manuscript discovered in 1945 at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, is a list of
114 sayings attributed to [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). Some of those
sayings resemble those found in the four canonical Gospels
([Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew"),
[Mark](Gospel_of_Mark "Gospel of Mark"),
[Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke"), and
[John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John")), but other sayings were
unknown until its discovery.

Unlike the four canonical gospels, which employ narrative accounts
of the life of Jesus, *Thomas* takes the less structured form of a
collection of sayings attributed to Jesus and brief dialogues with
Jesus and some of his disciples reported to Didymus Judas Thomas
without being embedded in any narrative nor worked into any
philosophical or rhetorical context.

When the complete text was found, in a Coptic version, it was
realized that three separate Greek portions of it had already been
discovered in Oxyrhynchus, Egypt in 1898. The manuscripts bearing
the Greek fragments of the *Gospel of Thomas* have been dated to
about 200, and the manuscript of the Coptic version to about 340.
Although the Coptic version is not quite identical to any of the
Greek fragments, it is believed that the Coptic version was
translated from a prior Greek version.

## The Gospel of Thomas as heresy

Because the Gospel of Thomas has a late date, this helps scholars
to understand how it may have been written. A comparison shows a
high probability of copying that took place between the writer of
the Gospel of Thomas and the four canonical Gospels. It can be
shown that a kind of mysticism has invaded the text, as well as the
authors intent to use Thomas' name as a title of the document in
hopes that it would gain widespread acceptance. One of the more
harmful sayings within the text are the last two verse (113-114 -
see "Quotes" below). Proponents of the Gospel of Thomas try and
explain this as a later addition to the text, however this is mere
speculation. Christians can safely conclude that the Gospel of
Thomas is a document that teaches heretical ideas concerning Jesus,
hence why it was not accepted in the
[canon of Scripture](Development_of_the_canon "Development of the canon").

## Quotes

\(113) His disciples said to him, "When will the kingdom come?"
 Jesus said, "It will not come by waiting for it. It will not be a
 matter of saying 'here it is' or 'there it is.' Rather, the kingdom
 of the father is spread out upon the earth, and men do not see
 it."

\(114) [Simon Peter](Simon_Peter "Simon Peter") said to him, "Let
 Mary leave us, for women are not worthy of life." Jesus said, "I
 myself shall lead her in order to make her male, so that she too
 may become a living spirit resembling you males. For every woman
 who will make herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven."
