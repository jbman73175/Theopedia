A **gospel presentation** is a presentation of the basics of the
[good news](Gospel "Gospel") of the Lordship of
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), his kingdom
come/coming, his death, burial, and
[resurrection](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus"), and
the free forgiveness of sins for those who
[repent](Repentance "Repentance") and trust in the person of Jesus
Christ. A presentation usually includes helpful elements for the
particular audience, such as
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") prophecies of the
[Messiah](Messiah "Messiah"), or the basics of the
[nature](Nature "Nature") of [God](God "God") and His benevolent
dominion over [humanity](Humanity "Humanity") for those
unacquainted with the basics of a biblical worldview (which centers
around the worship of the one true God).

There are examples of concise gospel presentations in the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), as well as various
modern ways of presenting the gospel through formulas that have
become popular. Moreover, there are also examples of longer gospel
presentations which encompass more holistic picture of the biblical
worldview for the listener.

"And Agrippa said to Paul, 'In a short time would you persuade me
to be a Christian?' And Paul said, 'Whether short or long, I would
to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might
become such as I am—except for these chains.' " (Acts 26:28-29)

## Presentations in the New Testament

### Jesus

Jesus preached of the
[kingdom of God](Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God"). He
authoritatively forgave sins and demonstrated the presence of the
kingdom of God by healing people of their sicknesses. It is perhaps
difficult to summarize Jesus' preaching on the gospel since his
whole ministry encompassed it.

### Peter

There is record of [Peter](Peter "Peter") preaching the gospel in
Acts 2 and 10. In Acts 10, [Luke](Luke "Luke") records the
following gospel presentation given to Cornelius and his family:

"Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, but in every
nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to
him. As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of
peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), you yourselves know
what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after
the baptism that John proclaimed: how God anointed Jesus of
Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing
good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was
with him. And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the
country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by
hanging him on a tree, but God raised him on the third day and made
him to appear, not to all the people but to us who had been chosen
by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from
the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people and to
testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the
living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that
everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through
his name." (v. 35-43)
### Paul

There is record of [Paul](Paul "Paul") giving the gospel in Acts
17:22-31. He preached on the nature of God, his care for humans and
desire to be in relationship with them, the judgment to come, and
then the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Paul finished his
presentation with this:

"The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all
people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he
will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has
appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him
from the dead."
Paul summarizes what he delivered as the gospel to those in Corinth
in 1 Corinthians 15:

"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also
received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the
Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day
in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas,
then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred
brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some
have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the
apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to
me. For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an
apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace
of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On
the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not
I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or
they, so we preach and so you believed." (v. 3-11)

#### The Four Laws

The Four Laws presentation was put together by
[Campus Crusade for Christ](Campus_Crusade_for_Christ "Campus Crusade for Christ")
and is used on many college campuses around the world. It can be
summarized as follows:

"1. God LOVES you and offers a wonderful PLAN for your life. 2. Man
is SINFUL and SEPARATED from God. Therefore, he cannot know and
experience God's love and plan for his life. 3. Jesus Christ is
God's ONLY provision for man's sin. Through Him you can know and
experience God's love and plan for your life. 4. We must
individually RECEIVE Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord; then we can
know and experience God's love and plan for our
lives."^[[1]](#note-0)^
#### Evangelism Explosion

Evangelism Explosion focuses on the question, "Where would you go
if you died, and why?"

*This is a **[section stub](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theopedia_sectionstubs "Category:Theopedia sectionstubs")**. Please edit it to add information.*
#### The Way of the Master

"The Way of the Master" focuses on using the law as a means of
helping a person know that they are a sinner, before the good news
is explained to
them.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
This is seen by adherents as not only relevant to the modern
culture (which seems to have little knowledge of the seriousness of
sin or the severity of its consequences), but also as a basic
principle of Biblical evangelism, which Jesus himself used.

#### Two Ways to Live

Authored by [Phillip Jensen](Phillip_Jensen "Phillip Jensen"),
"[Two Ways to Live](http://www.matthiasmedia.com.au/2wtl/)" is a
simple, memorable summary of the Christian gospel, including some
of its necessary presuppositions and background. ^[[2]](#note-1)^
The steps have a basic "script" that is learnt by rote; though
users are encouraged to adapt the delivery of their presentation to
their own style and to the situation. The six points provide a
brief summary of the whole Bible story, and fit together as a
coherent set of propositions:

1.  God the creator; humanity ruling under his authority.
2.  Humanity rebels, wishing to run things its own way.
3.  God judges (and will judge) humanity for this rebellion.
4.  In his love, God sends Jesus to die as an atoning sacrifice.
5.  In his power, God raises Jesus to life as ruler and judge.
6.  This presents us with a challenge to repent and believe.
