The **Governmental theory of the atonement** (also known as the
moral government theory) maintains that Christ was not punished on
behalf of the human race. Instead, God publicly demonstrated his
displeasure with sin by punishing his own sinless and obedient Son
as a propitiation. Because Christ's suffering and death served as a
substitute for the punishment humans might have received, God is
able to extend forgiveness while maintaining divine order, having
demonstrated the seriousness of sin and thus appeasing his wrath.

## Background

This view of the atonement was developed by
[Hugo Grotius](Hugo_Grotius "Hugo Grotius") (1583-1645) in his
writing against the [Socininans](Socinianism "Socinianism")
expounded in
"*Defensio Fidei Catholicae de Satisfactione Christi adversus F. Socinum*
(1636). Grotius, a theological
[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism"), utilized "governmental"
semantics due to his training in law and his general view of God as
moral governor (ruler) of the universe. Grotius sought to
demonstrate that the atonement appeased God in the divine role as
cosmic king and judge.

This view is contrasted with that of the
[Satisfaction theory](Satisfaction_theory "Satisfaction theory")
formulated by
[Anselm](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselm "wikipedia:Anselm")
(1033-1109), and the subsequent
[Penal substitution theory](Penal_substitution_theory "Penal substitution theory")
held by the Reformers which argues that Jesus received the actual
punishment due to men and women.

Governmental Atonement became the prominent view in
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism") and has prospered in
traditional [Methodism](Methodism "Methodism") where it has been
detailed by 19th century Methodist theologian
[John Miley](John_Miley "John Miley") in his *Atonement in Christ*
and his *Systematic Theology*
([ISBN 0943575095](http://www.theopedia.com/Special:BookSources/0943575095))
and more recently by Nazarene theologian J. Kenneth Grider in his
1994 book *A Wesleyan-Holiness Theology*
([ISBN 0834115123](http://www.theopedia.com/Special:BookSources/0834115123)).

## Additional details of the Governmental Theory

\1. God is holy and righteous and has established laws in his moral
 government. Sin is the violation of those laws. The dominant
 attribute of God in this theory, however, is love.

"God loves the human race. Although he has the right to punish it
for its sin, it is not necessary or mandatory that he do so. He can
forgive sin and absolve humans of guilt". He has chosen to [forgive
sin] in such a way that it manifests at once both his clemency and
severity. God can forgive sin, but he also takes into consideration
the interests of his moral government. 'It is possible for God to
relax the law so that he need not exact a specific punishment or
penalty for each violation.'" (1)
\2. Christ's death served as a substitute for punishment.

It was in the best interests of humankind for Christ to die.
Forgiveness of their sins, if too freely given, would have resulted
in undermining the law's authority and effectiveness. It was
necessary, therefore, to have an atonement that would provide
grounds for forgiveness and simultaneously retain the structure of
moral government. Christ's death served to accomplish both ends.
-   Christ's death was a substitute for a penalty, not "an actual
    penalty inflicted on him as a substitute for the penalty that
    should have attached to the breaking of the law by individual
    sinners."
-   God demonstrated through Christ's death "what God's justice
    will require us to suffer if we continue to sin."
-   It demonstrates what will occur if humans continue to sin
    against God's law. "The spectacle of the sufferings Christ bore is
    enough to deter us from sin." (2)

\3. If humans will turn from sin, God will forgive them and
 preserve His moral government.

"Because of Christ's death, then, it is possible for God to forgive
sins without a breakdown of the moral fiber of the universe." (3)
\4. "The death of Christ was not a punishment; on the contrary, it
 made punishment unnecessary."

God does not inflict punishment as a matter of strict retribution.
Sin is not punished simply because it deserves to be, but because
of the demands of moral government. The point of punishment is not
retribution, but deterrence of further commission of sins, either
by the one punished or by third parties who have observed the
punishment. Sin is deserving of punishment and God would not be
unjust to apply the penalty for sin in every case. But punishment
need not be applied in every case nor to the fullest extent. (4)
\5. A major presupposition of this view is that a vicarious penal
 substitution is impossible (although supporting penal substitution,
 see Leviticus 16, Isaiah 53:4-6, 8, 11-12, Matthew 20:28, John
 1:29, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Galatians 3:13-14, Colossians 2:13-14,
 Hebrews 1:3, 9:11-15, 27-28, 10:1-18, 1 Peter 2:24, 3:18, 1 John
 2:1-2, Revelation 5:9-10).

No penalty could be attached or transferred to Christ, for
punishment cannot be transferred from one person to another.
Punishment is personal to the individual. If it could be
transferred, the connection between sin and guilt would be severed.
Christ's suffering, then, was not a vicarious bearing of our
punishment, but a demonstration of God's hatred of sin, a
demonstration intended to induce in us a horror of sin. As we turn
from sin, we can be forgiven. Thus, even in the absence of
punishment, justice and morality are maintained.
The death was a real offering made by Christ to God. By this act
God was once and for all made able to deal mercifully with
humanity. The atonement had an impact on God. But in the main the
governmental theory is a subjective theory of the atonement "the
chief impact was on human beings. The purpose of Christ's death was
not to satisfy the demands of God's just nature so that he might be
enabled to do what he otherwise could not have done, namely,
forgive sins. Rather, Christ's death enabled God to forgive sins or
remit punishment in a way that would not have unfavorable
consequences or adverse effects on humans. Christ's suffering
serves as a deterrent to sin by impressing on us the gravity of
sin. As we turn from sin, we can be forgiven. (5)
## Objections

-   This view of the atonement denies that Christ was a penal
    substitute and that he died in the sinners place to atone for sins
    and satisfy divine justice on behalf of the elect. Rather it severs
    the direct covenantal link between the believer's salvation and
    Christ as his substitute. In its place it postulates that God
    arbitrarily forgives man's sins without reference to the work of
    Christ satisfying divine justice, and that, to preserve his status
    as Moral Governor of the Universe he made a public demonstration of
    his displeasure with sin by punishing it in his own Son, Jesus
    Christ. How it can pretend to uphold God's moral government by
    having the Son punished without having our sins imputed to him is
    somewhat inexplicable.

-   The governmental theory redefines the significance of the
    cross: rather than emphasizing what Christ objectively accomplished
    there, proponents of this view must define the cross in terms of
    how it can subjectively change the human heart.

-   Since Christ's death in this view serves as a moral example,
    salvation is defined in terms of what the sinner must do leading to
    perfectionism, moralism, or other works-based forms of religion.

-   This view fails to recognise the substitutionary motif in
    Christ's death as revealed in Matthew 20:28, 26:28; John 10:14-15;
    2 Corinthians 5:21 and Ephesians 5:25.

-   This theory fails to explain the reason for choosing a sinless
    person to demonstrate God's desire to uphold the law. Why not put
    to death the worst of all sinners? Why Christ and not
    [Barabbas](index.php?title=Barabbas&action=edit&redlink=1 "Barabbas (page does not exist)")?".

-   This view creates an injustice within the character of God, who
    rewards, and not punishes perfect righteousness (Jesus Christ).
    Thus, God would have been unjust in punishing His Son, in whom was
    nothing deserving such, without taking upon Himself the sins of the
    elect.

-   Finally, this theory does not take into account the depravity
    of mankind -- it assumes a mere example will be sufficient to
    enable man to perform a law-abiding way of living.
