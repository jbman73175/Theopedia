**Grace** is unmerited favor.
[Oswald Chambers](Oswald_Chambers "Oswald Chambers") adds that,
"The gospel of the grace of God awakens an intense longing in human
souls and an equally intense resentment, because the truth that it
reveals is not palatable or easy to swallow. There is a certain
[pride](Pride "Pride") in people that causes them to give and give,
but to come and accept a gift is another thing. I will give my life
to [martyrdom](Martyr "Martyr"); I will dedicate my life to service
I will do anything. But do not humiliate me to the level of the
most hell-deserving sinner and tell me that all I have to do is
accept the gift of [salvation](Salvation "Salvation") through
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ")."

The grace and [mercy of God](Mercy_of_God "Mercy of God") strikes
at the very heart of humanity. It has the ability to raise the most
extreme emotions by, as Oswald Chambers says, humiliating those who
want to add something to their salvation. On the other hand, it can
spark emotions of humility where one will "consider everything a
loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus
my Lord, for whose sake [we] have lost all things" and counting
them as "rubbish" (Phil. 3:8). This very grace came/comes through
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") (John 1:17; Romans 5:15; 1 Corinthians 1:4;
2 Timothy 1:9), a sufficient grace (2 Corinthians 12:9) that is
shown through the "redemption through his blood" and "forgiveness
of sins" (Ephesians 1:7) and it is this grace by which we are
justified (Titus 3:7) and saved (Ephesians 2:8).

[Peter](Peter "Peter") tells us to "set your hope fully on the
grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed" (1 Peter
1:13), for we worship the "God of all grace" (1 Peter 5:10).
Lastly, because we are saved through the work and grace of Jesus,
we may approach "the throne of grace with confidence, so that we
may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need"
(Hebrews 4:16).
