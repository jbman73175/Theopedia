**Granville Sharp's Rule** is a grammatical principle applied to
the translation of [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament")
[Greek](Greek "Greek") whereby the
[deity of Christ](Deity_of_Christ "Deity of Christ") is explicitly
affirmed. This is specifically associated with the translation of
Titus 2:13 and 2 Peter 1:1.

Titus 2:13:

-   [KJV](KJV "KJV") -- "Looking for that blessed hope, and the
    glorious appearing
    *of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ*." Similarly in the
    1901 [ASV](American_Standard_Version "American Standard Version"),
    [RSV](RSV "RSV"), and also in the New World Translation of the
    Jehovah's Witnesses.
-   [NASB](NASB "NASB") -- "Looking for the blessed hope and the
    appearing of the glory
    *of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus*." The same sense is
    also seen in [NIV](NIV "NIV") and [ESV](ESV "ESV").

In the above translations, the first implies a reference to two
persons, while the second (applying the Granville Sharp rule) sees
the reference to one person who is both God and savior. The same
contrast may be seen in 2 Peter 1:1:

-   [KJV](KJV "KJV") -- "to them that have obtained like precious
    faith with us through
    *the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ*."
-   [NASB](NASB "NASB") -- "To those who have received a faith of
    the same kind as ours, by
    *the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ*."

## Statement of the rule

"The following rule by Granville Sharp of a century back still
proves to be true: \`When the copulative KAI connects two nouns of
the same case, if the article HO or any of its cases precedes the
first of the said nouns or participles, and is not repeated before
the second noun or participle, the latter always relates to the
same person that is expressed or described by the first noun or
participle; i.e., it denotes a further description of the
first-named person.'" (*A Manual Of The Greek New Testament*, Dana
& Mantey, p. 147)

"Basically, Granville Sharp's rule states that when you have two
nouns, which are not proper names (such as Cephas, or Paul, or
Timothy), which are describing a person, and the two nouns are
connected by the word 'and,' and the first noun has the article
('the') while the second does not, both nouns are referring to the
same person." - [James White](James_White "James White")

The basic formula (in the Greek word order) may be seen in this
manner:

-   Article (*ho*) + noun1 + and (*kai*) + noun2

Granville Sharp's rule says that since the definite article (*ho*,
or its variant) precedes only the first noun and not both, then the
reference is to one person -- this being the case in the verses
quoted above.

## Cautions in application

Detractors maintain that there are numerous examples in the Greek
where Granville Sharp's rule fails to hold up, i.e. where two
distinct referents are obviously intended. However, as pointed out
by Daniel Wallace, this is due to a misapplication of the
rule.^[[1]](#note-0)^ What is often overlooked is that Granville
Sharp distinctly noted that the rule applies when the two nouns are
singular and apply to persons, not things. When these restrictions
are considered, there are no exceptions to be noted in native Koine
Greek constructions.

Wallace has restated Granville Sharp's rule in order to explicitly
state all the restrictions and to enhance the readability of the
rule.

> In native Greek constructions (i.e., not translation Greek), when a
> single article modifies two substantives connected by *kai* (thus,
> article-substantive-*kai*-substantive), when both substantives are
> (1) singular (both grammatically and semantically), (2) personal,
> (3) and common nouns (not proper names or ordinals), they have the
> same referent. ^[[2]](#note-1)^
