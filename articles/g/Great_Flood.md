## Purpose of the flood

"The LORD saw that the [wickedness](Wickedness "Wickedness") of man
was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of
his heart was only evil continually. And the LORD was sorry that he
had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. So the
LORD said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face
of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the
heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them." But Noah found
favor in the eyes of the LORD." (Genesis 6: 5-8)

Noah lived in a time of great
[corruption](Total_depravity "Total depravity"), when "the
wickedness of man was great in the earth, and ...every intention of
the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually" (Genesis 6:5),
"the earth was filled with violence" (Genesis 6:11), and when "all
flesh had corrupted their way on the earth." (Genesis 6:12). God
"determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled
with violence through them." (Genesis 6:13)

In stark contrast to Genesis 1:31, which says "And God saw
everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good", Genesis
6:12 says "And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt".

## Historicity of the flood

The remarkable level of detail regarding the whole of the deluge
account, including the dimensions of the
[Ark](Noah's_Ark "Noah's Ark"), the year the flood occurred, and
how long it lasted, all attest to the historicity of the
account.^[[1]](#note-0)^

From chronogenealogies in the Bible, the flood is calculated to
have occurred in Anno Mundi 1656, or 1656 years after the
[creation](Creation "Creation") of the world.^[[2]](#note-1)^

In Luke 17:26-27, when talking about the coming of the
[Kingdom of God](Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God"),
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") said "Just as it was in the days of
[Noah](Noah "Noah"), so will it be in the days of the
[Son of Man](Son_of_Man "Son of Man"). They were eating and
drinking and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day
when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them
all." In these verses Jesus takes the flood account as an
historical event, which "destroyed them all".

For people whose conviction of the supremacy and
[authority of Scripture](Authority_of_the_Bible "Authority of the Bible")
is influenced by [modernist thinking](Modernism "Modernism"), and
requires, or is facilitated by, scientific evidence, it is
encouraging to learn that there is extra-Biblical evidence to
support
[historical events](Biblical_archaeology "Biblical archaeology")
described in the [Bible](Bible "Bible"), and no indisputable
evidence to deny them. So, while the ultimate authority for
Christians remains the Scriptures, it is worth mentioning that
there is much scientific evidence to support a world-wide
flood.^[[3]](#note-2)^^[[4]](#note-3)^

## Extent of the flood

### Global flood

The language used in the flood account describes universal
destruction. In Genesis 7:11-24 (the description of the events of
the flood itself), the word "all" appears 8 times, and the word
"every" appears 6 times. "[The ark] rose high above the earth"
(7:17), "the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that all the
high mountains under the whole heaven were covered... covering them
fifteen cubits deep" (7:19, 20), "And all flesh died" (7:21), "He
blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground,
man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens. ...
Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark."
(7:23)

### Local flood

There are those who argue that the flood was merely a local event,
confined to the Mesopotamian area, although this position is based
more on acceptance of secular geology and
[evolutionary](Evolution "Evolution") presuppositions than on the
biblical text itself. The local flood theory can be traced back to
John Pye Smith in 1839, who's arguments are repeated today, even by
those who have never heard of him.^[[5]](#note-4)^

#### Problems with the local flood hypothesis^[[6]](#note-5)^

If the Flood was local...

-   why did Noah have to build an Ark? He could have walked to the
    other side of the mountains and missed it.

-   why did God send the animals to the Ark so they would escape
    death? There would have been other animals to reproduce that kind
    if these particular ones had died.

-   why was the Ark big enough to hold all kinds of land vertebrate
    animals that have ever existed? If only Mesopotamian animals were
    aboard, the Ark could have been much smaller.

-   why would birds have been sent on board? These could simply
    have winged across to a nearby mountain range.

-   how could the waters rise to 15 cubits (8 meters) above the
    mountains (Genesis 7:20)? Water seeks its own level. It couldn’t
    rise to cover the local mountains while leaving the rest of the
    world untouched.
-   people who did not happen to be living in the vicinity would
    not be affected by it. They would have escaped God’s judgment on
    sin. If this happened, what did Christ mean when He likened the
    coming judgment of all men to the judgment of ‘all’ men (Matthew
    24:37–39) in the days of Noah? A partial judgment in Noah’s day
    means a partial judgment to come.

-   God would have repeatedly broken His promise never to send such
    a flood again.
