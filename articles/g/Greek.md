**Greek** was one of the common languages throughout the
[Ancient Near East](index.php?title=Ancient_Near_East&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ancient Near East (page does not exist)")
in Biblical times, and is the language that the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") was written in and
the language that the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") was translated into
in the [Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint").
Scholars^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
generally agree that the 27 books which comprise the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") were originally
written in Koine Greek, although
some^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
maintain Matthew may have originally been written in Aramaic.

## Classical

Classical Greek refers to the language found in Greek writers of
the "Classical" period, generally viewed as being from 900 B.C. to
about 300 B.C. This is the language found in Homer's *Iliad* and
*Odyssey* circa 700 B.C. and in Greek philosophers such as Plato
circa 400 B.C. This more formal language is the predecessor of the
later New Testament Greek, but is sufficiently different that there
was some early confusion among
scholars^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
regarding the genesis and nature of the language of the New
Testament writers.

## Koine

Koine (*Κοινη*) is the Greek word for "common." For some time the
Greek language of the New Testament confused many scholars. It was
sufficiently different from Classical Greek that
some^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
hypothesized that it was a combination of Greek, Hebrew, and
Aramaic.
Others^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
attempted to explain it as a "Holy Ghost language," assuming that
perhaps God created a special language just for the Bible. But
studies of Greek papyri found in Egypt over the past 120
years^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
have shown that the Greek of the New Testament manuscripts was the
"common" (*koine*) language of the everyday people -- the same as
that used in the writing of wills, private letters, receipts, even
shopping lists, etc.
