Greg Bahnsen
**Greg Bahnsen** (1948-1995) was the scholar in residence at The
Southern California Center for Christian Studies where he taught
[Apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics") from a distinctly
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") perspective. Bahnsen followed the
lead of his mentor
[Cornelius Van Til](Cornelius_Van_Til "Cornelius Van Til") and
reasoned that, apart from the Christian faith, the unbeliever
cannot account for his knowledge. Bahnsen earned a B.A. in
Philosophy from Westmont College, his M.Div and ThM from
Westminster Theological Seminary (1973), and a PhD in
[epistemology](Epistemology "Epistemology") (the theory of
knowledge) from the University of Southern California (1978).

Bahnsen was a pillar of the Christian Reconstruction movement
associated with
[Rousas John Rushdoony](Rousas_John_Rushdoony "Rousas John Rushdoony").
As such, Bahnsen was a leading proponent of
[theonomy](Theonomy "Theonomy"),
[postmillennialism](Postmillennialism "Postmillennialism"), and
[presuppositional apologetics](Presuppositional_apologetics "Presuppositional apologetics").
He lectured to a broad range of evangelical Christian groups at
many colleges and conferences, in the United States and abroad. His
1985 debate with atheist scholar, the late Gordon Stein, was dubbed
The Great Debate, and remains a classic as well as a benchmark in
Christian apologetics.

His early death came as a result of complications following his
third heart surgery in December of 1995.
