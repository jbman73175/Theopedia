**Gregory J. Laughery** is an American / Swiss theologian. For the
past twenty years he has been associated with
[L'abri Fellowship](http://www.labri.org/swiss/home) and is
currently living and teaching at [L'Abri](L'Abri "L'Abri") in
Huémoz, Switzerland.

## Background

Laughery was born in San Francisco, California. He spent the first
twenty-six years of his life in “the city,” before moving on to new
adventures in a variety of locations.

His nominally Catholic and then Lutheran family lived in an
apartment just around the corner from the soon to become famous
Haight-Ashbury district. In the days of 1952, the Haight, was a
quiet, fairly traditional, racially mixed, family neighborhood.
Some years later, the family moved to a small house some four or
five blocks away.

Laughery was educated in a Lutheran school for eight years. After
being thrown out he attended public schools, but eventually was
again asked to leave before completing the eleventh grade. During
the 1960s he took part in the tune in, turn on, drop out, cultural
expressions that arose in San Francisco. Reading philosophy, taking
drugs, and searching for reality were the educational directions he
took to learn more about life.

Eventually making his way to Europe in 1980, Laughery studied with
Dr. [Francis Schaeffer](Francis_Schaeffer "Francis Schaeffer") at
L’Abri Fellowship, before going on the take a theology degree at
the London School of Theology, a license and a specialization
diploma in New Testament at the University of Lausanne,
Switzerland, and a PhD at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland.
