Gregory Boyd
"**Gregory Boyd** is the preaching pastor at Woodland Hills Church
in St. Paul, Minn., and the author of *God of the Possible* and
*Across the Spectrum*, among several books."
[[1]](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/002/42.89.html) He
is one of the leading proponents of
[Open theism](Open_theism "Open theism"), one of the most
controversial and hotly debated ideas in modern
[evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") theology. His first
published work, a doctoral dissertation, called 'Trinity and
Process: Toward a Synthesis', established the processist
philosophical trajectory of all his future works.

Formerly a professor of Theology at Bethel College, Boyd received
his B.A. in philosophy at the University of Minnesota, his M.Div.
from Yale Divinity School, and a Ph.D. at Princeton Theological
Seminary.

## Quotes

-   "...Even when the Lord announces that some aspect of the future
    is settled, it may still be alterable. The 'settledness' may be
    conditioned on unsettled factors, such as decisions we make. What
    this shows us is that not only is part of the future open, but also
    some aspects of the future that God has announced as settled are to
    some extent open. God's mind can yet be changed..." (Gregory Boyd,
    *God of the Possible*, p. 44)
-   "Prior to creation, God possessed 100 percent of all power. He
    possessed all the say-so there was. When the Trinity decided to
    express their love by bringing forth a creation, they invested each
    creature (angelic and human) with a certain percentage of their
    say-so. The say-so of the triune God was at this point no longer
    the only one that determined how things would go. God's personal
    creations now possessed a measure of ability to influence what
    would occur" (*God of the Possible*, p. 97)
-   "It is true that according to the
    [open view](Open_theism "Open theism") things can happen in our
    lives that God didn?t plan or even foreknow with certainty (though
    he always foreknew they were possible). This means that in the open
    view things can happen to us that have no overarching divine
    purpose. In this view,Â ?trusting in God? provides no assurance that
    everything that happens to us will reflect his divine purposes, for
    there are other agents who also have power to affect us, just as we
    have power to affect others. This, it must be admitted, can for
    some be a scary thought." (*God of the Possible*, p. 153)
