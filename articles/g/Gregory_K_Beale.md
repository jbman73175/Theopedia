## Theology

Beale believes that all doctrine, and thus, the entire
[Bible](Bible "Bible"), should be read through the lens of
eschatology. Furthermore, the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") should be read with
a realization that it's central focus is on new creation. This
places the life, death and resurrection of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")
through the [Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") as the inauguration
of the new creation and the [end times](End_times "End times").
Therefore, Beale believes that new creation is in mind whenever the
resurrection of Jesus is mentioned.
