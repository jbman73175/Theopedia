## Quotes about Stand to Reason

-   "There has never been a time in our culture when ministries
    like this one are so badly needed. And Greg Koukl is just the type
    of person to start such a ministry. I have known Greg Koukl and
    ministered with him long enough to say with joy and conviction that
    he is a man of tremendous talent, dedication, and integrity. His
    skill as a Christian thinker is well-developed, his gifts of
    communication are clear, and his heart to build Christ's kingdom
    and not his own are evident."^[[2]](#note-1)^

-   "I am delighted to hear of the birth of a brand new ministry
    called Stand to Reason. I have followed Greg Koukl's radio ministry
    for some time now, and appreciate his ability as a broadcaster as
    well as his heart for people. Greg's focus on equipping God's
    people for works of service so that the body of Christ might be
    built up and strengthened is much needed."^[[3]](#note-2)^
