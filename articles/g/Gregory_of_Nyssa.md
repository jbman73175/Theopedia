**Gregory of Nyssa** (ca. 335-394) was an early Christian bishop of
Nyssa in the region called Cappadocia, which is in modern day
Turkey. He was a younger brother of
[Basil the Great](Basil_the_Great "Basil the Great"), bishop of
Caesarea. Basil appointed Gregory bishop of Nyssa in 372, gaining
an episcopal ally near to his metropolitan *see* of Caesarea.
Gregory was present at the Council of Antioch, and later at the
Second Ecumenical Council which took place in Constantinople. There
he was a defender of the Nicene Creed against the Arians.

## Theology

Gregory is recognized for his contributions to the doctrine of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") and the concept of God's infinity. He
is also known for his idea of *epektasis*, or constant progress. In
his theology, he recognized that God has always been perfect, has
never changed, and never will. Humanity fell from grace, but rather
than return to an unchanging state its goal is to continually
progress to become more and more nearly like God, although never
attaining God's transcendance. This idea has had a profound
influence on the
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox") teaching as
seen in its concept of *[theosis](Theosis "Theosis")* or
"divinization".
