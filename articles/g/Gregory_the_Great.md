**Gregory the Great** (540 - 604) became [Pope](Pope "Pope") in
590, at the death of
[Pelagius I](index.php?title=Pelagius_I&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pelagius I (page does not exist)").
He actually disclaimed the title [Pope](Pope "Pope"), but wielded
all the power of the office, effectively asserting the dominance of
the bishop of Rome over all others. He was the first pope to do
this effectively, which is one reason that his reign is considered
the first of the Middle Ages.

He came into conflict when the patriarch of Constantinople claimed
the title "ecumenical bishop", which mirrored the power and
position he had sought for the papacy.
