"Genuine guilt toward God arises from illumination we receive from
the Bible. It appears as the result of a breakdown in man’s
obedience to God and his utter dependence upon God. It is a truly
genuine guilt when the sinner knows in his innermost heart that he
has disobeyed God, and that all such disobedience is sin. If a
person is gripped with guilt-feelings which are a result of sin and
the convicting power of the Holy Spirit, there is one solution, and
only one. He must turn to God, trusting the redeeming work of
Christ, and he may be veritably assured of forgiveness and
cleansing. To all such the Bible says, “Come now, and let us reason
together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they
shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they
shall be as wool” (Isaiah 1:18)." Lehman Strauss
