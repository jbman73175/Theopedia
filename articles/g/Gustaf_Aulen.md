**Gustaf Aulén** (1879-1978) was the Bishop of Strängnäs in the
Church of Sweden and the author of
*Christus Victor: An Historical Study of the Three Main Types of the Idea of Atonement*
in 1931. This classic work analyzes the doctrine of the
[atonement of Jesus](Atonement_of_Jesus "Atonement of Jesus"),
suggesting that the three main interpretations in Christian history
are the [Christus Victor](Christus_Victor "Christus Victor")
theory, the
[Satisfaction](Satisfaction_theory_of_the_atonement "Satisfaction theory of the atonement")
theory, and the
[Moral Influence theory](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ").
Aulén is also known in the Swedish Lutheran Church as a composer of
widely used church music.

Aulén claims to be reintroducing the "classic idea of the
atonement," the
[Christus Victor](Christus_Victor "Christus Victor") theory. He
says it is the "classic" view of the
[atonement](Atonement "Atonement") reflecting the Early
[Church Fathers](Church_Fathers "Church Fathers") as well as
Scripture and distinguishes it from the later developed
Satisfaction theories of the middle ages which he calls the "Latin"
view. Aulén states that Satisfaction theory was only fully
articulated by
[Anselm of Canterbury](Anselm_of_Canterbury "Anselm of Canterbury")
in the 11th century, and the
[Moral Exemplar Influence](Moral_Influence_theory "Moral Influence theory")
finds its genesis in
[Peter Abelard](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Abelard "wikipedia:Peter Abelard")
and has been popularized by 19th and 20th century
[liberal theologians](Liberalism "Liberalism"). Aulén criticizes
both the medieval Latin view as well as the liberal view as
lacking. The Christus Victor theory is described as a battle. Its
central theme is the idea of the Atonement as a Divine conflict and
victory; Christ -- Christus Victor -- fights against and triumphs
over the evil powers of the world, the 'tyrants' under which
mankind is in bondage and suffering, and in Him God reconciles the
world to Himself. One could also describe Christus Victor as a
motif of divine rescue and liberation from the bondage of
[sin](Sin "Sin"), death, and the devil. Central to its
understanding are the ideas of the
[Incarnation](Incarnation "Incarnation") and the Lordship of
Christ. In this sense of liberation and rescue it is parallel to
the [Ransom Theory](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ")
however it also stresses Christ's victory over sin and is thus
centered in the idea of the
[Resurrection.](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus")

Aulen also authored *The Faith of the Christian Church* and
*Reformation And Catholicity*.
