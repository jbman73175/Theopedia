Harry Ironside
**Henry (Harry) Allen Ironside** (1876 - 1951), born in Toronto,
was a [Bible](Bible "Bible") teacher, preacher,
[evangelist](Evangelism "Evangelism"), and author in the late 19th
century and early 20th century.

"Although he had little formal education and was never ordained, he
travelled for well over fifty years as a home missionary,
evangelist, and Bible teacher. A prolific writer, he contributed
regularly to various Christian periodicals and journals in addition
to publishing over eighty books and pamphlets. His writings
included addresses or commentaries on the entire
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), all of the
prophetic books of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament"), and a great many
volumes on specific themes and subjects.

"For some time he was with the Salvation Army but later joined the
[Plymouth Brethren](Plymouth_Brethren "Plymouth Brethren"). After
1924 he held meetings continually under the auspices of Moody Bible
Institute, going often as visiting faculty to Dallas Theological
Seminary. For eighteen years of ministry (1930-1948), he was pastor
of the Moody Memorial Church in Chicago. He went to be with the
Lord on January 16, 1951, while on a preaching tour in New
Zealand."

Along with others such as
[C. I. Scofield](C._I._Scofield "C. I. Scofield"), he was
influential in popularizing
[dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") among
[Protestants](Protestantism "Protestantism") in North America.
Despite his lack of formal education, his tremendous mental
capacity, photographic memory and zeal for his beliefs caused him
to be called "the Archbishop of Fundamentalism."
