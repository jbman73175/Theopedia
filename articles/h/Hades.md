"The temporary abode of the unbeliever after death. The word Hades
occurs ten times in the New Testament (Matt. 11:23; 16:18; Luke
10:15; 16:23; Acts 2:27; 2:31; Rev. 1:18; 6:8; 20:13, 14). Hades is
the abode of the wicked in the intermediate state, that is the time
from which they die until the judgment at the Great White Throne
(Rev. 20:11-15)."

John F. Walvoord writes that the term Hades

"in some instances refers to more than the grave and indicates the
intermediate state, as Christ himself taught in Luke 16:19-31. In
Revelation 6:8 the pale horse, representing death, is described:
'Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind
him.' The reference may be to physical death and the grave, or it
may in the context go beyond the grave to the intermediate state of
suffering for the wicked.
"Two of the most important references occur in Revelation.
20:13-14, where it is stated: 'The sea gave up the dead that were
in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and
each person was judged according to what he had done. Then death
and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is
the second death.' John implies that the grave will some day give
up the bodies of the wicked dead and that they will be resurrected
in order to enter into the eternal punishment of the lake of fire.
The fact that they are still in existence indicates that their
existence was not terminated when they died physically, but they
are still alive and suffering torment in hades, the intermediate
state up to this point. This state is then emptied, however, and
those who are in it are cast into the lake of fire, the second
death; this action indicates eternal separation from
God."^[[1]](#note-0)^
