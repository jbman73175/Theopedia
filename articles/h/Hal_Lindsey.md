Hal Lindsey
**Hal Lindsey** (born 1929) is an American evangelist and Christian
writer. A graduate of Dallas Theological Seminary and noted
[dispensationalist](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism"), he
expresses this theology in his writings, focusing on
[end times](End_times "End times") prophecies.

Lindsey is probably most noted for his first book
*The Late, Great Planet Earth*, published in 1970 by Zondervan.
This became one of the best selling works of non-fiction in that
decade. Coming on the heels of the
[Six-Day War](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War "wikipedia:Six-Day War"),
the book fueled the popularity of
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") and its
support of ethnic Jews as the "chosen people of God". It has been
published in 54 languages, has reported sales of over thirty-five
million copies, and is still in print. Many of Lindsey's later
writings are sequels or revisions and extensions of this first
book.
