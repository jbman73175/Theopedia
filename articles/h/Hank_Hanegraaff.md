**Hendrik "Hank" Hanegraaff** (b. 1950), aka "The Bible Answer Man"
is president of the Charlotte, NC-based
[Christian Research Institute](Christian_Research_Institute "Christian Research Institute")
[(CRI)](http://www.equip.org/), the author of several books,
including *The Prayer of Jesus* and *Christianity in Crisis*, and
is probably best known as the host of the *Bible Answer Man* radio
program. His show, on which he discusses Christian
[apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics") and
[Biblical](Bible "Bible")
[hermeneutics](Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics"), is nationally
syndicated and can be heard on numerous radio stations as well as
on the Internet. [[1]](http://www.equip.org/bam/radiolog.asp)

## History

Hanegraaff was born in the Netherlands and raised in the United
States in the
[Christian Reformed Church](Christian_Reformed_Church "Christian Reformed Church").
He came to faith by examining the scientific evidence for creation,
the resurrection of Christ, and the inspiration of Scripture, and
was later discipled under the ministry of Dr. D. James Kennedy,
holding significant positions in major church programs. He was
eventually ordained by Chuck Smith of Calvary Chapel in California.
In 1989, he succeeded
[Walter Martin](Walter_Martin "Walter Martin") as president of the
Christian Research Institute and assumed the role of anchorman on
The Bible Answer Man radio program.

Hanegraaff is noted for his belief that
[Biblical inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy") can be proven on a
rational basis. Hanegraaff has also been an outspoken opponent of
what he describes as pseudo-Christian cults, such as the
[Jehovah's Witnesses](Jehovah's_Witnesses "Jehovah's Witnesses"),
[Mormons](Mormonism "Mormonism"), and the
[Word of Faith](Word_of_Faith "Word of Faith") movement.
Questioning the validity of religious beliefs and practices has
resulted in considerable controversy for Hanegraaf, particularly
with fellow Christians. On his radio program and in books such as
*Counterfeit Revival*, for example, he has criticized charismatic
movements like the
[Toronto Blessing](index.php?title=Toronto_Blessing&action=edit&redlink=1 "Toronto Blessing (page does not exist)")
as unbiblical and dangerous, which has drawn opposition from
leaders who disagree with his assessments, including attacks on
credibility and legal battles.
