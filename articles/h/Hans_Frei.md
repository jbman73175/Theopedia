## Quotes

"I am persuaded that historical inquiry is a useful and necessary
procedure but that theological reading is the reading of a *text*,
and not the reading of a *source*, which is how historians read it.
Historical inquiry, while telling us many useful things, does not
tell us how we are to understand the text as texts."
