## Education

Küng studied theology and philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian
University in Rome and was ordained in 1954. He then continued his
education in various European cities, for example at the Sorbonne
in Paris. His doctoral thesis was entitled
*Justification: Doctrines of Karl Barth and a Catholic Reflection*.

## Mid-life

In 1960 Küng was appointed professor of theology at Eberhard Karls
University, Tübingen, Germany. Just like his colleague Joseph
Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), in 1962 he was appointed
peritus by Pope John XXIII, serving as an expert theological
advisor to members of the Second Vatican Council until its
conclusion in 1965. At the instigation of Küng the Catholic Faculty
at Tübingen appointed Ratzinger as professor of dogmatics. However,
due to the fact that Ratzinger moved in a more conservative
direction in the reaction to the 1968 students revolt, the
cooperation between the two came to an end.

In the late 1960s Küng became the first major Roman Catholic
theologian after the late 19th century
[Old Catholic Church schism](Great_Schism "Great Schism") to reject
the doctrine of papal infallibility, in particular in his book
Infallible? An Inquiry (1971). Consequently, on December 18, 1979,
he was stripped of his license to teach as a Roman Catholic
theologian but carried on teaching as a tenured professor of
ecumenical theology at the University of Tübingen until his
retirement (Emeritierung) in 1996. To this day he remains a
persistent critic of papal authority, which he claims is man-made
(and thus reversible) rather than instituted by God. He was not
excommunicated and remains a Roman Catholic priest.

## Later life

In the early 1990s Küng initiated a project called Weltethos
(Global Ethic), which is an attempt at describing what the world
religions have in common (rather than what separates them) and at
drawing up a minimal code of rules of behaviour everyone can
accept. His vision of a global ethic was embodied in the document
for which he did the initial draft, Towards a Global Ethic: An
Initial Declaration. This Declaration was signed at the 1993
Parliament of the World's Religions by many religious and spiritual
leaders from around the world. Later Küng's project would culminate
into the UN's "Dialogue among Civilizations" to which Küng was
assigned as one of 19 "Eminent Persons". Even though completed
shortly after September 11 (in November 2001), there was no
coverage in the US media, something Küng complained about.

Based on "Studium Generale"—lectures at Tubingen University, his
latest publication The Beginning of All Things discusses the
relationship between science and religion. In an analysis spanning
from quantum physics to neuroscience he also comments on the
current debate about evolution in the United States, dismissing
those opposed to evolution as "naive un-enlightened."

## Quotes

-   "If you cannot see that divinity includes male and female
    characteristics and at the same time transcends them, you have bad
    consequences. Rome and Cardinal O'Connor base the exclusion of
    women priests on the idea that God is the father and Jesus is his
    son, there were only male disciples, etc. They are defending a
    patriarchal church with a patriarchal God. We must fight the
    patriarchal misunderstanding of God." — Newsweek interview, July 8,
    1991

-   "Everyone agrees the celibacy rule is just a church law dating
    from the 11th century, not a divine command." — Newsweek interview,
    July 8, 1991
