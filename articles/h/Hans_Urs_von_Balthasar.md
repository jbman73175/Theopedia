Hans Urs von Balthasar
**Hans Urs von Balthasar** (1905-1988) was a Swiss
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic")
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian"). Along with
[Karl Rahner](Karl_Rahner "Karl Rahner"), Balthasar is one of the
most important Roman Catholic theologians of the 20th century.

Balthasar was educated in Benedictine and Jesuit secondary schools
and went on to study in Vienna, Berlin, and Zurich. In 1928 he
underwent his doctoral examination at the University of Zurich, a
liberal Protestant institution, having completed a dissertation on
the "History of the Eschatological Problem in Modern German
Literature." In November 1928 he entered the Jesuit novitiate for
two years, after which he studied Scholastic philosophy with a
Jesuit faculty near Munich, followed by four years of theology near
Lyon. Thus he was a licentiate in both philosophy and theology,
though his doctorate remained only in literature. ^[[1]](#note-0)^
