## Background

Ockenga was born and raised in Chicago, and his family belonged to
the Methodist church. Sensing a call to pastoral ministry, he
attended Taylor University in Indiana (a Methodist institution)
graduating in 1927. He then enrolled at Princeton Theological
Seminary. However his theological studies there were interupted
when he, along with many conservative students followed those
members of the faculty - such as
[J. Gresham Machen](J._Gresham_Machen "J. Gresham Machen") - who
withdrew from Princeton to establish the Westminster Theological
Seminary in Philadelphia in 1929. Ockenga graduated from
Westminster 1930 and later received a PhD in philosophy from the
University of Pittsburgh in 1939.

## A leader in Neo-evangelicalism

Ockenga became a significant leader in what became known as
[Neo-evangelicalism](Neo-evangelicalism "Neo-evangelicalism") or
the New Evangelicalism. The roots of this are found in the
theological controversy between Protestant
[Fundamentalists](Fundamentalism "Fundamentalism") and Protestant
Liberals in the earlier part of the Twentieth century. While
Ockenga sided with the fundamentalists in reaction to theological
liberalism, he with others, such as Carl Henry, Harold Lindsell,
Wilbur Smith, and Edward John Carnell, became dismayed with the
growing militant isolationism of the fundamentalists.

In an effort to redress these concerns Ockenga and J. Elwin Wright
of the New England Fellowship established a new organization known
as the
[National Association of Evangelicals](National_Association_of_Evangelicals "National Association of Evangelicals").
Ockenga served as its founding president from 1942-1944. Those
affiliated with the association were interested in maintaining many
of the biblical concerns that fundamentalism held to. However they
also sought to direct conservative Christianity away from the
anti-cultural and anti-intellectual tendencies which began to
typify fundamentalists.

This effort continued in the founding of
[Fuller Theological Seminary](Fuller_Theological_Seminary "Fuller Theological Seminary")
in Pasadena, California. The principal founding figures of Fuller
Seminary included Charles E. Fuller (radio evangelist), Ockenga,
[Carl Henry](Carl_Henry "Carl Henry"), and Harold Lindsell.

In the foreword to *The Battle For the Bible* by Harold Lindsell,
Ockenga gave his view of the term neo-evangelicalism:

"Neo-evangelicalism was born in 1948 in connection with a
convocation address which I gave in the Civic Auditorium in
Pasadena. While reaffirming the theological view of fundamentalism,
this address repudiated its ecclesiology and its social theory. The
ringing call for a repudiation of separatism and the summons to
social involvement received a hearty response from many
Evangelicals. ... It differed from fundamentalism in its
repudiation of separatism and its determination to engage itself in
the theological dialogue of the day. It had a new emphasis upon the
application of the gospel to the sociological, political, and
economic areas of life."
When Ockenga retired from Park Street church in 1969 he was
appointed president of Gordon College and Divinity School.
Reflective of the desires he had in establishing Fuller seminary,
Ockenga was instrumental in negotiating the merger of Gordon
Divinity School with the Conwell School of Theology. He
collaborated with men such as J. Howard Pew, Billy Graham and
[Walter Martin](Walter_Martin "Walter Martin") in establishing
[Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary](Gordon-Conwell_Theological_Seminary "Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary").
Ockenga served as its president from 1970-79.
