**Biblical** or **Classical Hebrew** is the ancient form of the
Hebrew language, in which the Hebrew Bible (**Tanakh**) was
written, and which the ancient Israelites spoke. It is not spoken
in its pure form today, although it is studied both by religious
Jews and by Christian theologians and academics for practical
application and deeper understanding in their studies of the Torah
and its commentaries. Jews usually learn it when studying ancient
scriptures. It is also studied by linguistic scholars and
historians.

Modern evolutions of Classical Hebrew are in active use today,
mostly in the form of various modern Jewish dialects of Hebrew, as
well as the Samaritan Hebrew language, which is used primarily by
the Samaritans.

From a linguistic point of view, the Classical Hebrew language is
usually divided into two periods having very distinct grammatical
patterns: **Biblical Hebrew** and **Roman Era Hebrew**.

Biblical Hebrew is further divided into the so-called 'Golden Age'
Hebrew (1200 BC to 500 BC) and 'Silver Age' Hebrew (500 BC to 60
BC). Silver Age Hebrew has many borrowings from
[Aramaic](Aramaic "Aramaic"), for example the use of the
conditional particle *illu* replacing *lū*.

Roman Era Hebrew, or Mishnaic Hebrew, has further grammatical
influences from [Greek](Greek "Greek") and Parsi, mainly through
the dialect of Aramaic which was the *lingua franca* of the area at
the time.

## History

The earliest that linguists have been able to date the emergence of
Ancient Hebrew is around the 12th century B.C. Its Aramean roots
are clear, even though many linguists attempt to place it with
Canaanite languages, rejecting the biblical record on shaky
evidence.

[Abraham](Abraham "Abraham") and all his tribe were Aramean by
descent and thus spoke an Aramean Semitic language. Because of
their time in Mesopotamia, however, Akkadian had the opportunity to
influence their tongue. After leaving that country, Abraham and his
descendants spent a great deal of time in Canaan, still maintaining
their language, although there is every indication that certain
Canaanite accents were incorporated into the language. It was when
the Israelites, i.e. Jacob and his descendants, moved to
[Egypt](index.php?title=Ancient_Egypt&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ancient Egypt (page does not exist)")
and lived there for over 400 years, that their language started to
take its own form. It was in Egypt that the finer points of the
Hebrew language began to take shape, preparing the way for a
developed writing system.

## Alphabet

Please note that one ought to read this alphabet (or 'alephbet')
from top to bottom and from right to left. Thus the first letter is
'aleph' the second, 'beyt', etc.

## Vowels

Scholars and linguists believe that the written form of Ancient
Hebrew did not originally include vowels, but was written with
consonants alone. This would have made for a rather difficult
reading as time went on and at some point after their separation
from Edom, Moab, and Ammon, the Israelites began to use what is
known as matres lectionis, which is a system peculiar to Ancient
Hebrew. This scheme used three different characters to indicate the
presence of a vowel before the next consonant.

## Tanakh

Tanakh (also Tanach or Tenach) is an acronym that identifies the
Hebrew Bible. The acronym is based on the initial Hebrew letters of
each of the text's three parts:

1.  **T**orah meaning one or all of: "The Law"; "Teaching";
    "Instruction." Also called the *Chumash* meaning: "The five"; "The
    five books of Moses." This is the first five books, frequently to
    as the "Pentateuch."
2.  **N**evi'im meaning: "Prophets." These are the books of
    prophecy, not including Lamentations.
3.  **K**etuvim meaning "Writings" or "Hagiographa." This included
    the books of poetry and historical books.

The books are ordered as above, which differs greatly from the
ordering used in the Christian Bible; most notably the Christian
Bible places the writings second and the prophets last.

Frequently the entire Old Testament was referred to as the "Torah"
or the "Law" (see Psalm 1:2; John 10:34). In modern times the term
"Torah" may also include books of Jewish tradition such as the
[Mishna](index.php?title=Mishna&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mishna (page does not exist)")
and [Talmud](Talmud "Talmud").

Together the Jewish books of the Law, Prophets, and Writings
comprise the [Masoretic text](Masoretic_text "Masoretic text")
(MT), the Hebrew text of the Scriptures approved for general use in
Judaism. This also corresponds to the books contained in the
Christian Old Testament.
