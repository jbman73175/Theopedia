The **Heidelberg Catechism** is a document used in
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") churches to help teach church
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine"). It takes the form of a series of
questions and answers to help the reader better understand the
material. It has been translated into many languages and is
regarded as the most influential Reformed catechism.

Elector Frederick III, sovereign of the Palatinate from 1559 to
1576, appointed
[Zacharias Ursinus](Zacharias_Ursinus "Zacharias Ursinus") and
Caspar Olevianus, to write a Reformed catechism based on input from
the leading Reformed scholars of the time. One of its aims was to
counteract the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church regarding
theology, basing each statement on the text of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible").

The Catechism was divided into fifty-two sections, each to be
taught one Sunday of the year. The Synod of Heidelberg approved the
catechism in 1563. In the Netherlands, the National Synods of the
sixteenth century adopted it as one of the
[Three Forms of Unity](Three_Forms_of_Unity "Three Forms of Unity"),
making it requisite for [Elders](Elder "Elder") and
[Deacons](Deacon "Deacon") to subscribe to, and ministers to
teach.
