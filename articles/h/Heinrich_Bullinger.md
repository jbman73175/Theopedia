Heinrich Bullinger
**Heinrich Bullinger** (July 18, 1504 - September 17, 1575) was a
Swiss reformer, the successor of
[Huldreich Zwingli](Huldreich_Zwingli "Huldreich Zwingli") as head
of the Zurich church. A much less controversial figure than
[Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") or
[Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"), his importance has long
been underestimated. Recent research has shown, though, that he was
one of the most influential Reformed
[theologians](Theologian "Theologian") of the 16th century.

## Life

The son of Dean Heinrich Bullinger by his wife Anna (Wiederkehr),
he was born at Bremgarten, Aargau.

He studied at Emmerich and Cologne, where the teaching of
[Peter Lombard](Peter_Lombard "Peter Lombard") led him, through
[Augustine of Hippo](Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo") and
[Chrysostom](John_Chrysostom "John Chrysostom"), to first hand
study of the [Bible](Bible "Bible"). Next the writings of
[Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") and
[Melanchthon](Philipp_Melanchthon "Philipp Melanchthon") appealed
to him.

Appointed teacher (1522) in the cloister school of Kappel, he
lectured on Melanchthon's *Loci Communes* (1521). He heard
[Zwingli](Huldreich_Zwingli "Huldreich Zwingli") at Zürich in 1527,
and next year accompanied him to the disputation at Berne.

In 1529 Bullingers father was dismissed in Bremgarten due to his
Evangelical confession. Shortly afterwards, though, his son held a
sermon in his hometown which made the citizens burn their pictures
of saints and elect the young priest for their pastor. In the same
year, he married Anna Adlischweiler, a former nun. His marriage was
happy and regarded as a shining example. His house was continually
filled with fugitives, colleagues and people searching for advice
or help. Bullinger was a caring father of his eleven children who
liked to play with them and wrote verses to them for Christmas. All
his sons became pastors themselves.

After the defeat at Battle of Kappel (October 11, 1531), where
Zwingli fell, Bremgarten had to return to the Catholic faith.
Bullinger and two other pastors had to leave the town, though the
people did not like to see them go.

Bullinger arrived with his wife and two little children in Zurich,
where he already on the Sunday after his arrival stood in Zwingli's
pulpit in the Great Minster and, according to a contemporary
description, "thundered a sermon from the pulpit that many thought
Zwingli was not dead but resurrected like the phoenix". In December
of the same year, he was, at the age of 27, elected to be the
successor of Zwingli as antistes of the Zurich church. He accepted
the election only after the council had assured him explicitely
that he was in his preaching "free, unbound and without
restriction" even if it necessitated critique of the government. He
kept his office up to his death in 1575.

A strong writer and thinker, his spirit was essentially unifying
and sympathetic, in an age when these qualities won little
sympathy.

Bullingers hospitality and charity was exemplary and Zurich
accepted many protestant fugitives from northern Italy (Johann
Heinrich Pestalozzi was a descendant of such fugitives) and after
the death of Henry VIII also from England. When these returned to
England after the death of Mary I of England, they took Bullingers
writings with them who found a broad distribution. From 1550 to
1560, there were in England 77 editions of Bullinger's Latin
"Decades" and 137 editions of their vernacular translation "House
Book", a treatise in pastoral theology (in comparison, Calvins
Institutions had two editions in England during the same time).
Some historians count Bullinger together with Bucer as the most
influential theologian of the Anglican reformation.

Though Bullinger did not leave Switzerland after becoming antistes
of Zurich, he conducted an extended correspondence all over Europe
and was so well informed that he edited a kind of newspaper about
political developments.

His controversies on the
[Lord's Supper](Lord's_Supper "Lord's Supper") with Luther, and his
correspondence with Lelio Sozini, exhibit, in different
connections, his admirable mixture of dignity and tenderness. With
[Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") he concluded (1549) the
*Consensus Tigurinus* on the Lord's Supper. He died at Zürich and
was followed as antistes by his son-in-law Rudolf Gwalther.

Among his descendants was the noted Biblical scholar
[E. W. Bullinger](E._W._Bullinger "E. W. Bullinger").

## Works

Bullingers works comprise 127 titles. Already during his lifetime
they were translated in several languages and counted among the
best known theological works in Europe.

### Theological works

His main work were the
*Decades", a treatise in pastoral theology, in the vernacular called "House Book".*

The (second)
[Helvetic Confession](index.php?title=Helvetic_Confession&action=edit&redlink=1 "Helvetic Confession (page does not exist)")
(1566) adopted in Switzerland, Hungary, Bohemia and elsewhere, was
originally believed to be his work. However, it has been recently
demonstrated that
[Peter Martyr Vermigli](Peter_Martyr_Vermigli "Peter Martyr Vermigli")
played a decisive role in this document as well. The volumes of the
*Zürich Letters*, published by the Parker Society, testify to his
influence on the English
[reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation") in
later stages.

Many of his sermons were translated into English (reprinted, 4
vols., 1849). His works, mainly expository and polemical, have not
been collected.

### Historical

Besides theological works, Bullinger also wrote some historical
works of value. The main of it, the "Tiguriner Chronik" is a
history of Zurich from Roman times to the Reformation, others are a
history of the Reformation and a history of the Swiss
confederation.

### Letters

There exist about 12,000 letters from and to Bullinger, the most
extended correspondence preserved from Reformation times. He mainly
wrote in Latin with some quotes in Hebrew and Greek, about 10
percent in Swiss German.

Bullinger was a personal friend and advisor of many leading
personalities of the reformation era. He corresponded with
Reformed, Anglican, Lutheran, and Baptist theologians, with Henry
VIII of England, Edward VI of England, Lady Jane Grey and Elizabeth
I of England, Christian II of Denmark, Philipp I of Hesse and
Frederick III, Elector Palatine.
