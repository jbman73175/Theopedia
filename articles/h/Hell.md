The term **Hell** has two uses in Scripture: (1) the temporary,
intermediate holding place for the coming judgment (sometimes
referred to as *[sheol](Sheol "Sheol")*, *[hades](Hades "Hades")*,
or *[tartarus](Tartarus "Tartarus")*), or (2) the place of eternal
punishment for the damned (*[gehenna](Gehenna "Gehenna")*). Both
senses entail suffering and torment. Of the latter Jesus said the
"worm does not die and the fire is not quenched" (Mark 9:48).
Hebrews describes "eternal judgment" as of the foundation of the
"elementary doctrine of Christ" (Hebrews 6:1-2).

Hell exists because of the justice and holiness of God.

"If the slightest sin is infinite in its significance, then it also
demands infinite punishment as a divine judgment. Though it is
common for all Christians to wish that there were some way out of
the doctrine of eternal punishment because of its inexorable and
unyielding revelation of divine judgment, one must rely in
Christian faith on the doctrine that God is a God of infinite
righteousness as well as infinite love. While on the one hand he
bestows infinite grace on those who trust him, he must, on the
other hand, inflict eternal punishment on those who spurn his
grace."^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Old Testament teaching

The Old Testament "clearly suggests that the sufferings of the
wicked continue forever"^[[2]](#note-1)^, but it more often than
not refers to a shadowy holding place (sheol).

### Relevant passages

-   Deuteronomy 32:22
-   Isaiah 33:14-15; 14:9-10
-   Psalm 94:1-2, 23
-   Job 21:30-34

*See related article: [Sheol](Sheol "Sheol")*
## Intertestamental teaching

"In the last four hundred years before Christ there was extensive
discussion among Jewish theologians concerning the Old Testament
doctrine of everlasting punishment. Generally speaking, the
Pharisees taught that there was everlasting punishment, while the
school of Hillel thought that the punishment of the ungodly would
last only a year before they would be annihilated. The latter
believed that some of the more wicked would go on being punished
for some time. These interpretations of Jewish scholars in the
intertestamental period are not decisive as they lack the further
revelation of the New Testament. Their conclusions are not backed
by Scripture."^[[3]](#note-2)^
## New Testament teaching

### Terms

"*[H]ades* is used of the temporary place of the unsaved after
death but is not used in relationship to the lake of fire or
eternal punishment, though it implies duration at least for the
time being. The most definitive term in the New Testament is
*gehenna*, uniformly translated 'hell' and referring to everlasting
punishment (Matt. 5:22, 29, 30; 10:28; 18:9; 23:15, 33; Mark 9:43,
45, 47; Luke 12:5; James 3:6). One instance of the Greek word
*tartaros* is found in 2 Peter 2:4; it is translated 'hell' and
considered equivalent to *gehenna*"^[[4]](#note-3)^
*See main articles: [Hades](Hades "Hades"), [Gehenna](Gehenna "Gehenna"), and [Tartarus](Tartarus "Tartarus")*

## Apostolic Fathers

William Crockett writes^[[5]](#note-4)^,

During the time of the early Apostolic Fathers, Christians believed
hell would be a place of eternal, conscious punishment. In Ignatius
of Antioch's letter *To the Ephesians* (ca. A.D. 117) we read:
"Such a one shall go in his foulness to the unquenchable fire"
(16:2). Likewise, in the *Epistle to Diognetus* (ca. A.D. 138) we
read: . . . when you fear the death which is real, which is kept
for those that shall be condemned to the everlasting fire, which
shall punish up to the end those that were delivered to it. Then
you will marvel at those who endure for the sake of righteousness
the fire which is for a season (10:7-8). 40 And 2 Clement reads
(ca. A.D. 150):
Nothing shall rescue us from eternal punishment, if we neglect his
commandments (6:7).
And again:
'...when they see those who have done amiss, and denied Jesus by
word or deed, are punished with terrible torture in unquenchable
fire (17:7).
Finally, in the Martyrdom of Polycarp (ca. A.D. 156- 60) we read:
And the fire of their cruel torturers had no heat for them, for
they set before their eyes an escape from the fire which is
everlasting and is never quenched (2:3).
And again:
You threaten with the fire that burns for a time, and is quickly
quenched, for you do not know the fire which awaits the wicked in
the judgment to come and in everlasting punishment (11:2).
## Everlasting punishment?

"In the Old Testament a number of Hebrew words are used to express
the thought of eternity, such as *olam*, *alam*, *nesah*, and *ad*.
In the New Testament *aionios* is used most prominently... In
support of the idea that *aionios* means 'endless' is its
consistent placement alongside the duration of the life of the
godly in eternity. If the state of the blessed is eternal, as
expressed by this word, there is no logical reason for giving
limited duration to punishment...

"The ultimate convincing argument for eternal punishment is found
in Revelation 20:10-15, in the context of how eternity will change
things in time. In this passage, as has been previously pointed
out, the beast and the false prophet, cast into the lake of fire at
the beginning of the millennium (19:20), are still there a thousand
years later and are declared to join with Satan in the torment
which will continue 'day and night for ever and ever' (20:10). The
state of the wicked is likewise declared to be that of being cast
into the lake of fire. The wicked who had suffered in hades, in
some cases for thousands of years, are then transferred to the lake
of fire (20:12-15). John goes on to imply they will have a
permanent 'place . . . in the fiery lake of burning sulfur' (21:8).
Instead of predicting the termination of punishment, all the
implications of these statements support the doctrine of eternal
punishment. Finally, though aionios is generally used of eternal
life, it is specifically coupled with punishment of the wicked in
Jude 7, where Jude says of Sodom and Gomorrah: 'They serve as an
example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.' This
is in contrast to 'eternal life' mentioned in verse
21."^[[6]](#note-5)^

## Literal fire?

Some hold the view that, while hell entails eternal conscious
torment, it does not necessarily involve a literal fire. Others
hold to the notion that the Bible paints too strong a picture of
hell with fire to avoid it as an aspect John F. Walvoord writes,

"[T]he frequent mention of fire in connection with eternal
punishment supports the conclusion that this is what the Scriptures
mean (cf. Matt. 5:22; 18:8-9; 25:41; Mark 9:43, 48; Luke 16:24;
James 3:6; Jude 7; Rev. 20:14-15). There is sufficient evidence
that the fire is literal. In the case of the rich man and Lazarus
in Luke 16:19-31, the rich man in hades asked father Abraham to
cool his tongue with water because, 'I am in agony in this fire'
(v. 24). Thirst would be a natural reaction to fire, and the desire
to cool his tongue would be in keeping with this
description."^[[7]](#note-6)^
William Crockett affirms that hell entails eternal conscious
torment, but disagrees that the Biblical language of fire indicates
that hell necessarily involves literal fire:

"[T]here is overwhelming evidence... that the New Testament
pictures of hell are metaphors and not literal descriptions.
"First, the biblical writers do not intend their words to be taken
literally. Jude calls hell the 'blackest darkness' (Jude 13) when
only moments earlier in verse 7 he pictures it as an 'eternal
fire.' The same is true for Matthew, who often uses the opposite
images of fire (Matt. 3:10, 12; 25:41) and darkness (8:12; 22:13;
25:30) when describing hell. If we extend this to the broad sweep
of New Testament theology, we can hardly miss the incongruent
images of blackest darkness in Jude and Revelation's vast 'lake of
fire' (Rev. 19:20; 20:10, 14-15; 21:8).
"Second, physical fire works on physical bodies withphysical nerve
endings, not on spirit beings. We see in Matthew 25:41 that the
eternal fire was created for spirit beings like the devil and his
angels. The fire must in some sense be a spiritual fire, which is
another way of acknowledging it to be a metaphor for God's
punishment of the wicked.
"Third, the New Testament descriptions of heaven and hell are
symbolic pictures, not itemized accounts of eschatological
furniture. The writers use the most powerful symbols available in
the first century to communicate their meaning. Heaven is pictured
as an ancient city, adorned with the treasures of the world. It
comes complete with golden streets, pearled gates, jewel-laden
walls, and sparkling rivers. Even the most lowly have plenty of
food, spacious living quarters, and eternal rest. Hell is the
opposite. There the wicked suffer in darkness and fire, afflicted
by maggots and tormented with blows. There they weep and gnash
their teeth. Like stars, they wander in eternal night, a symbol of
ultimate remorse, where joy and hope are forever lost.
"Fourth, in ancient times teachers often used words symbolicallyto
underscore their points (rabbinic hyperbole, as we now call it). To
be a disciple you must 'hate' your father and mother (Luke 14:26),
'gouge out' an offending eye (Matt. 5:29), let the dead 'bury their
own dead' (Luke 9:60). Such colorful language was understood by all
to be hyperbole, picturesque speech to bring home the urgency of
the situation. The same is true with the images of hell recorded in
the New Testament. Their purpose is not to give the reader a
detailed, literal picture of torment, but a symbolic one.
"Fifth, the pictures we have of hell outside the Bible in Jewish
literature are vivid and mostly symbolic. The object was to paint
the most awful picture possible, no matter how incompatible the
images. Writers warn of 'black fire' (2 Enoch 10:2), 'blazing
flames worse than fire' (1 Enoch 100:9), and a place where the
wicked burn eternally, even though at the same time their bodies
rot with maggots (Judith 16:17; Sirach 7:17). Their picturesque
descriptions are not meant to be literal reports of the doings of
the damned, but warnings of coming judgment."^[[8]](#note-7)^
Crockett further writes:

"Fire is often nonliteral in Jewish writings; they use colorful
language to make a point. Even the Torah was said to have been
written with 'black fire on white fire' (Jerusalem Talmud, Shekalim
6:1, 49d), and the tree of life was described as goldlooking in
'the form of fire' (2 Enoch 8:4). There are mountains of fire
(Pseudo-Philo 11:5), rivers of fire (1 Enoch 17:5), thrones of fire
(Apoc. Abram. 18:3), lashes of fire (T. Abram. 12:1)—even angels
and demons of fire (2 Bar. 21:6; T. of Sol. 1:10). In the
Scriptures God is said to be a 'consuming fire' (Deut. 4:24), who
has a throne 'flaming with fire' that has a 'river of fire' issuing
from beneath the throne (Dan. 7:9-10). Sometimes the images of fire
approximate our understanding of material fire on earth. God speaks
out of fire that does not consume a desert bush (Ex. 3:1-6) and
carries a prophet to heaven in a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11). In
the New Testament, John says of the exalted Christ, 'his eyes were
like blazing fire' (Rev. 1:14). Fire is also used figuratively for
discord (Luke 12:49), judgment (1 Cor. 3:15), sexual desire (1 Cor.
7:9), and unruly words (James 3:5-6)."^[[9]](#note-8)^
[John Piper](John_Piper "John Piper") argues that, even if "fire"
is a symbol, this doesn't alleviate the horror of hell:

"Suppose fire is a symbol. Do people use symbols of horror because
the reality is less horrible or more horrible than the symbols? I
don’t know of anyone who uses symbolic language for horrible
realities when literal language would make it sound more horrible.
"People grasp for symbols of horror (or beauty) because the reality
they are trying to describe is worse (or better) than they can put
into words. If I say, 'My wife is the diamond of my life,' I don’t
want you to say, 'Oh, he used a symbol of something valuable; it’s
only a symbol. So his wife must not be as valuable as a diamond.'
No. I used the symbol of the most valuable jewel I could think of
because my wife is far more precious than jewels. Honest symbols
are not used because they go beyond reality, but because reality
goes beyond words.
"So when the Bible speaks of hell-fire, woe to us if we say, 'It’s
only a symbol.' If it is a symbol at all, it means the reality is
worse than fire, not better. The word 'fire' is used not to make
the easy sound terrible, but to make the exceedingly terrible sound
something like what it really is."^[[10]](#note-9)^
[J.I. Packer](J.I._Packer "J.I. Packer") takes the metaphorical
view and concurs that the symbol represents far worse than literal
fire:

". . . the mistake is to take such pictures as physical
descriptions, when in fact they are imagery symbolizing realities .
. . far worse than the symbols themselves."^[[11]](#note-10)^
## Degrees of punishment?

"Jesus... indicated that punishment in hell would be by degrees,
depending on their understanding of the will of their master.
Accordingly, one servant would have a lighter beating than another
(Luke 12:47, 48), and hypocrites would receive more condemnation
than others (Mark 12:40)."^[[12]](#note-11)^

In Matthew 11:24, Jesus says, "But I tell you that it will be more
tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for
you." (cf. Revelation 20:11-12)

This teaching makes
[annihilationism](Annihilationism "Annihilationism") particularly
awkward. On this William Crockett writes,

"The Pharisaic-minded crowds, who believed in eternal suffering for
the wicked, could not mistake what Jesus meant. Even the most vile
people, he was saying, would receive a lesser sentence in the
afterlife than they who had received and rejected so much truth. In
other words, what you sow, you reap. If you are exceedingly evil,
you will be punished exceedingly; if your sin is less, your
punishment will be less when God sentences you on the Judgment Day.
Annihilationism fits rather awkwardly here. It has no sense of
distributive justice—Heinrich Himmler and Mahatma Ghandi receive
the same punishment.
"Annihilationists might respond that certain evildoers will simply
suffer longer, or more intensely, before being extinguished. The
problem is that the setting for the gradations of punishment in
Luke 12:47-48 is *gehenna* (12:5). So now we have extended
suffering in the final abode of the wicked. If we were to ask which
line of Jewish eschatological punishment this fits better with
annihilationism or eternal, conscious suffering the answer would
surely be the latter. The truth is that when punishment is
administered according to the depth of sin, the presumption is that
the wicked will suffer for an extended time—presumably forever. For
example, in the *Sibylline Oracles* noted above (2:290-310), the
wicked must pay 'threefold' for the evil deeds they have committed.
The more evil committed, the more suffering in the next life. And
their anguish in *gehenna* never ends. This is precisely the point
mentioned in Matthew and Luke sixty years or so earlier. Hell is a
dreadful place, but not a place of equal suffering. Some will
receive lesser punishment, some more."^[[13]](#note-12)^
## Aberrant views

### Conditional immortality (annihilationism)

This view is also called annhilationism and is held by
[Clark Pinnock](Clark_Pinnock "Clark Pinnock"). It holds that "God
eventually destroys the souls of the wicked rather than punishing
them endlessly."^[[14]](#note-13)^

*See main page: [Annihilationism](Annihilationism "Annihilationism")*
### Purgatory

"[Purgatory] is commonly understood to refer to the state, place,
or condition in the next world between heaven and hell, a state of
purifying suffering for those who have died and are still in need
of such purification. This purifying condition comes to an end for
the individual when that person's guilt has been expiated. But as
an eschatological 'place,' purgatory is understood to continue in
existence until the last judgment, at which time there will be only
heaven and hell."^[[15]](#note-14)^

## Quotes

-   "To some, that the idea of 'forever' does not always mean an
    infinite duration in time may seem to be an unnecessary concession
    to the opponents of eternal punishment. But like the word 'all,'
    this word has to be interpreted in its context; and where the
    context itself limits the duration, this needs to be recognized in
    fairness to the text. At the same time, however, an important
    principle must be observed all throughout the Scriptures: while the
    term 'forever' may sometimes be curtailed in duration by its
    context, such termination is never once mentioned in either the Old
    or New Testament as relating to the punishment of the wicked.
    Accordingly, the term continues to mean 'everlasting' or 'unending
    in its duration.' Unfortunately, this is not recognized by those
    who are opposed to eternal punishment." - John F.
    Walvoord^[[16]](#note-15)^

-   "The body will be full of torment as full as it can hold, and
    every part of it shall be full of torment. They shall be in extreme
    pain, every joint of 'em, every nerve shall be full of
    inexpressible torment. They shall be tormented even to their
    fingers' ends. The whole body shall be full of the wrath of God.
    Their hearts and their bowels and their heads, their eyes and their
    tongues, their hands and their feet will be filled with the
    fierceness of God's wrath. This is taught us in many Scriptures..."
    - Jonathan Edwards^[[17]](#note-16)^

-   "Even if it were possible that the experience . . . of the lost
    contained no pain and much pleasure, still, that black pleasure
    would be such as to send any soul, not already damned, flying to
    its prayers in nightmare terror." - C.S. Lewis^[[18]](#note-17)^
