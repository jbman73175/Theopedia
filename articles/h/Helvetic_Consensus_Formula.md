The **Helvetic Consensus Formula** is the last doctrinal Confession
of the Reformed Church of Switzerland, and closes the period of
[Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") creeds. It has been called a
'symbolical after-birth.' It was composed in 1675, one hundred and
eleven years after Calvin's death, by Professor John Henry
Heidegger, of Zurich (1633–1698), at the request and with the
co-operation of the Rev. Lucas Gernler, of Basle (d. 1675), and
Professor [Francis Turretin](Francis_Turretin "Francis Turretin"),
of Geneva (1623–1687). It never extended its authority beyond
Switzerland, but it is nevertheless a document of considerable
importance and interest in the history of Protestant theology. It
is a defense of the scholastic Calvinism of the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort") against the theology
of Saumur (Salmurium), especially against the universalism of
[Moses Amyraut](Amyraldism "Amyraldism"). ^[[1]](#note-0)^
