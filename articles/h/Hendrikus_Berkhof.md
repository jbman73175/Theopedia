**Hendrikus Berkhof** (1914-1995) was a theologian in the Dutch
Reformed church. After receiving his B.D. and Th.D. degrees at the
University of Leiden, Berkhof served as a minister for twelve
years, as Principal of the Theological Seminary of the Netherlands
Reformed Church from 1950-1960 and many years as Professor of
Dogmatics and Biblical Theology at the University of Leiden.

Berkhof was critical of the traditional view of
[Scripture](Scripture "Scripture") and denied both
[inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy") and the infallibility of the
Bible. He viewed the [virgin birth](Virgin_birth "Virgin birth") as
a myth and ultimately denied the
[incarnation](Incarnation "Incarnation"),
[deity of Christ](Deity_of_Christ "Deity of Christ"), and the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity").^[[1]](#note-0)^ In Berkhof's words,
"The [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") shows us a
history in which the man [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"), because of his
total obedience even to death, may share in the life and rule of
[God](God "God")." ^[[2]](#note-1)^
