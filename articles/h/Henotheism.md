**Henotheism** is the belief that many gods exist, yet the worship
of only one of these gods is appropriate. A henotheist would admit
that many gods may exist and are able to be worshipped. However the
henotheist chooses to worship only one of these gods. This sets the
henotheist apart from the polytheist who worships many
gods.[[1]](http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/nbi/304.html)

According to the American Heritage Dictionary, henotheism is the
belief in one god without denying the existence of others. Hinduism
is a classic example of this belief in practice. Hindus generally
worship one god, yet acknowledge that there are many other gods
that can be worshiped as well. The religion of the ancient Greeks
and their worship of the Olympians is another well-known example,
with Zeus being the supreme ruler of eleven other gods. All twelve
were worshiped, each individually by a different sect or
temple.[[2]](http://www.gotquestions.org/henotheism.html)
