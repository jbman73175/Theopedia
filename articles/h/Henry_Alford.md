Henry Alford
**Henry Alford** (1810 - 1871) was an English churchman,
theologian, hymnodist, and writer. He studied at Trinity College,
Cambridge (B.A., 1832), and was ordained deacon in 1833, priest in
1834, and elected a fellow of Trinity the same year; he became
vicar of Wymeswold, Leicestershire, 1835, minister of Quebec
Chapel, Marylebone, London, in 1853, and dean of Canterbury in
1857.

He was a multi-talented man, a good musician, a wood-carver and
painter of some skill, a good preacher, and for many years a
successful teacher of private pupils. His publications include
sermons, lectures, essays and reviews, poems, hymns, a translation
of the Odyssey in blank verse (London, 1861), an edition of the
works of John Donne (6 vols., 1839), The Queen's English (1864),
and even a novel, Netherton on Sea (1869), written in collaboration
with his niece (Elizabeth M. Alford). He was Hulsean lecturer for
1841-42 and published his lectures under the title, The Consistency
of the Divine Conduct in Revealing the Doctrines of Redemption (2
vol.). He was the first editor of the Contemporary Review
(1866-70).

The great work of his life, however, was his Greek Testament (4
vol., London, 1849-61; thoroughly revised in subsequent editions),
which introduced German New Testament scholarship to English
readers, and involved a vast amount of patient labor. An outcome of
this work was The New Testament for English Readers (4 vol., 1868)
and a revised English version (1869). He was one of the original
members of the New Testament Revision Committee.

Near the close of his life he projected a commentary on the Old
Testament, and prepared the Book of Genesis and part of Exodus,
which were published posthumously (1872).
