Henry Morris
**Henry M. Morris** (1918-2006) is arguably the most influential
young-earth creationist of the 20th century. By combining
scientific credentials with biblical arguments on the origin of
life, Henry Morris ignited a movement more than 40 years ago that
earned him the label “the father of modern
[creationism](Creationism "Creationism").”

Morris received his B.Sc. in civil engineering from Rice University
(1939), and earned a master's degree in hydraulics (1948) and a
Ph.D. in hydraulic engineering (1950), both from the University of
Minnesota. He began a college teaching carrer in 1951 and
eventually served as professor of hydraulic engineering and civil
engineering department head at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University until 1969.

Morris teamed with Old Testament scholar John C. Whitcomb in
writing the seminal *The Genesis Flood*, first published in 1961.
Either a source of controversy or inspiration, depending on one's
perspective, it attempted to scientifically explain the theory of
divine creation. It also paved the way for Dr. Morris to help found
what is now San Diego Christian College in El Cajon in 1970 and to
launch the Institute for Creation Research in Santee.
