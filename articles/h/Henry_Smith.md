**Henry Smith** (1560-1591), born in Withcote, Leicestershire, was
one of the most influential and prolific
[Puritan](Puritan "Puritan") divines during Elizabeth’s reign in
England. He was known as “silver-tongued Smith” to his
contemporaries. Smith’s practical and experiential sermons were
used for family devotions for over a century after his death, and
went through numerous editions. The Puritan
[Richard Baxter](Richard_Baxter "Richard Baxter") in his magnum
opus of practical divinity, *The Christian Directory*, recommends
Smith’s sermons as essential even for the “smallest library that is
tolerable.”

After leaving the college at Lincoln College, Oxford, Smith lived
and followed his studies with Richard Greenham, rector of Dry
Drayton, Cambridgeshire, and sometime fellow of Pembroke Hall.

Smith devoted himself to the ministry of the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England"), but
upon considering his disagreement with various practices and
ceremonies, he contented himself with the lectureship, a common
Puritan practice. Smith sought to reform the English church from
within, believing that it was utterly unlawful to make a
separation.

Subsequently, Smith preached in and about London with great
success, and in 1587, upon Greenham’s recommendation, was elected
lecturer at St. Clement Danes, London, by the rector and
congregation.

He resigned his lectureship in 1590, due to failing health, retired
to Husbands Bosworth, Leicestershire, and busied himself in
preparing his works for the press and in revising his sermons. He
dedicated his collected sermons to Lord Burghley, but died before
the collection was published. Smith was buried at Husbands Bosworth
on July 4, 1591. He was universally lamented by both the
[Anglican](Anglican "Anglican") and Puritan parties.
