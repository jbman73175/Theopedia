**Heresy** is a teaching or practice which denies one or more
essentials of the Christian faith, divides Christians, and deserves
condemnation. The term is derived from the Greek word *hairesis*,
literally meaning a choice, but referring more specifically to a
sect, party or disunion. Luke uses the term in Acts to refer to the
sects of the [Sadducees](Sadducees "Sadducees") (5:17),
[Pharisees](Pharisees "Pharisees") (15:5; 26:5), and even the
Christians - called Nazarenes and *the Way* (24:5,14; 28:22). When
[Paul](Paul "Paul") uses the term in 1 Corinthians and Galatians,
he refers to the divisions which cause strife in the church, while
[Peter](Peter "Peter") links the term to false prophets and
teachers.

While there is a temptation for Christians to label whatever is not
in keeping with sound doctrine as heresy, the Bible seems to make
the distinction that heresy is *not* merely the opposite of
orthodoxy. Rather, heresy is a divisive teaching or practice which
forces those who call themselves Christians to separate from it or
face condemnation for it.
[John the Apostle](John_the_Apostle "John the Apostle") gave a
prime example of such a doctrine: denying the true nature of the
person and work of [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") (I
John 4:1-3; 2 John 1:7-11).
