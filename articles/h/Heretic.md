In Christianity, a **heretic** is one who holds a theological or
religious opinion or doctrine in opposition or contrary to that
which is considered as [orthodox](Orthodox "Orthodox"), or *right*
doctrine. For example, one writer defines it in this manner: "A
*heretic* is a baptized person who obstinately denies or doubts a
truth which the Church teaches must be believed because it is part
of the one, divinely revealed, and catholic (that is, universally
valid) Christian faith." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

Heretics usually do not define their own beliefs as heretical.
Heresy is a value judgement expressing the view from within an
established belief system. For instance,
[Roman Catholics](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") generally held
leading [Protestants](Protestant "Protestant") of the Reformation
to be heretics.
