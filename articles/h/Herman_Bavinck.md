Herman Bavinck
**Herman Bavinck** (1854-1921), a Dutch
[Reformed](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology")
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian"), was a contemporary of
[Abraham Kuyper](Abraham_Kuyper "Abraham Kuyper") and
[B. B. Warfield](B._B._Warfield "B. B. Warfield"), both of whom he
knew well. He graduated *magna cum laude* in 1880 from Leiden with
a double major in
[Systematic Theology](Systematic_Theology "Systematic Theology")
and [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament"). His doctoral
dissertation was on the concept of the State in
[Zwingli's](Huldreich_Zwingli "Huldreich Zwingli") theology.
Bavinck taught at the Theological Seminary in Kampen, Holland -
where he also pastored - before accepting the position of professor
at the Free University of Amsterdam. He is best known for his
magnum opus, *Reformed Dogmatics* (Gereformeerde Dogmatiek, in 4
volumes). Bavinck is one of the most balanced and solidly Reformed
theologians Holland ever produced.

Bavinck introduced the notion of organic inspiration of the
Scriptures and also developed a solution to the
[infra/supralapsarian](Supralapsarianism "Supralapsarianism")
conundrum. Although Bavinck passed away in 1921, he remains a
powerful force in Reformed theology. Several important Reformed
theologians owe large debts to his work, including
[Cornelius Van Til](Cornelius_Van_Til "Cornelius Van Til") and
[Louis Berkhof](Louis_Berkhof "Louis Berkhof").
