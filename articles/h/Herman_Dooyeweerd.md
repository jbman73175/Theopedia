**Herman Dooyeweerd** (1894-1977), born in Amsterdam, was a Dutch
juridical scholar, philosopher, and the founder of a new approach
called, *the philosophy of the cosmonomic idea*. Dooyeweerd
(pronounced DOE-yuh-vaird) received early support for his work from
his brother-in-law D. H. Th. Vollenhoven and later from H.G. Stoker
in South Africa and
[Cornelius Van Til](Cornelius_Van_Til "Cornelius Van Til") in the
United States.

The majority of Dooyeweerd's works originally appeared only in
Dutch, although during his lifetime efforts began to make his work
available to English-speakers. Translation of Dooyeweerd's writing
has continued since 1994 under the oversight of the Dooyeweerd
Centre (see link below). Of the books that have been published in
English, the most significant is his magnum opus,
*De Wijsbegeerte der Wetsidee* (1935-6), which was revised and
expanded in English as, *A New Critique of Theoretical Thought*
(1953-8).

Dooyeweerd's influence has continued through the
*Association for Reformational Philosophy* and its journal
*Philosophia Reformata* which he and Vollenhoven set up. There are
also a number of institutions around the world that draw their
inspiration from his philosophy.
