Herman Hoeksema
**Herman Hoeksema** (1886-1965), a Dutch
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed")
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian"), was born in the Netherlands
and immigrated to the USA in 1904. After studying at Calvin
Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan, he began his
ministerial career in the Eastern Avenue Christian Reformed Church
of Grand Rapids - at that time one of the largest reformed
congregations in the United States.

Hoeksema was one of the principal founders of the
[Protestant Reformed Churches](Protestant_Reformed_Church "Protestant Reformed Church")
(PRC). Founded as a separate denomination of Reformed churches in
1924, the PRC stand in the tradition of the Protestant Reformation
of the 16th century. Their origin as a denomination was the
doctrinal controversy over
"[common grace](Common_grace "Common grace")" within the
[Christian Reformed Church](Christian_Reformed_Church "Christian Reformed Church")
in the early 1920s, occasioned by that church's adoption of the
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of common grace as official church
dogma. The result of the controversy was that several ministers
with their congregations were put out of the Christian Reformed
Church. These men then established the Protestant Reformed
Churches.

The newly-formed PRC denomination established the Protestant
Reformed Seminary where Hoeksema served as professor of theology
for 40 years.
