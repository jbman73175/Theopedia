Hermann Witsius
**Hermann Witsius** (1636 - 1708), Dutch
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian"), was born at Enkhuisen, North
Holland, and studied at Groningen, Leiden and Utrecht. He was
ordained to the ministry, becoming pastor at Westwoud in 1656 and
afterwards at Wormeren, Goesen, and Leeuwaarden, and became
professor of divinity successively at the University of Franeker in
1675 and then at the University of Utrecht in 1680. In 1698 he went
to the University of Leiden as the successor of the younger
Friedrich Spanheim (1632-1701), where he died.^[[1]](#note-0)^

While in his theology Witsius aimed at a reconciliation between
orthodoxy and
[Covenant Theology](Covenant_Theology "Covenant Theology") (also
known as federalism), he was first of all a Biblical theologian,
his principal field being systematic theology. His chief work is
entitled *The Economy of the Covenants between God and Man*
(originally published in Latin:
*De oeconomia foderum Dei cum hominibus*, Leeuwarden, 1677). He was
induced to publish this work by his grief at the controversies
between the Voetians and Cocceians (followers of
[Johannes Cocceius](Johannes_Cocceius "Johannes Cocceius")).
Although himself a member of the federalistic school, he was in no
way blind to the value of the scholastically established dogmatic
system of the Church. In the end, he did not succeed in pleasing
either party.

In his work on the covenants, Witsius argued against
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic"),
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"),
[Socinianism](Socinianism "Socinianism"), and those Dutch
Protestant theologians, who, with
[Hugo Grotius](Hugo_Grotius "Hugo Grotius"), had exchanged a
[sola scriptura](Sola_scriptura "Sola scriptura") theology for an
institutionalized, sacramental view of the church based on
traditions that paved the way back to Rome. Witsius opposed
Grotians “who spoke of a ‘law’ which was not the law of Moses, a
‘satisfaction’ which was not through punishment and a
‘substitution’ which was not of necessity and not vicarious.”

Besides his principal work, he published:

-   *Judaeus christianizans circa principia fidei et SS. Trinitatem*
    (Utrecht, 1661)
-   *Diatribe de septem epistolarum apocalypticarum sensu historico et prophetico*
    (Franeker, 1678)
-   *Exercitationes sacrae in symbolum quod apostolorum dicitur et in orationem Dominicam*
    (Franeker, 1681)
-   *Miscellanea sacra* (Utrecht, 1692-1700, 2 vols).

Of his minor works, there have appeared in English
*A Treatise on Christian Faith* (London, 1761);
*On the Character of a True Theologian* (Edinburgh, 1877); and
*The Question: Was Moses the Author of the Pentateuch Answered in the Affirmative*
(1877).

## The Voetian-Cocceian conflict

During Witsius' professorship at Franeker, tension between the
Voetians and the Cocceians escalated. Gisbertus Voetius
(1589-1676), a renowned Reformed scholastic theologian and
professor at Utrecht, represents the mature fruit of the
*Nadere Reformatie* (Dutch Second Reformation), much as John Owen
does for English Puritanism. Voetius unceasingly opposed
[Johannes Cocceius](Johannes_Cocceius "Johannes Cocceius")
(1603-1669), the Bremen-born theologian who taught at Franeker and
Leiden, and whose
[covenant theology](Covenant_theology "Covenant theology"), in
Voetius’s opinion, overemphasized the historical and contextual
character of specific ages. Voetius believed that Cocceius’s new
approach to the Scriptures would undermine both Reformed dogmatics
and practical Christianity. For Voetius, Cocceius’s devaluing of
practical Christianity culminated in his rejection of the
[Sabbath](Sabbath "Sabbath") as a ceremonial yoke no longer binding
on Christians. The Voetian-Cocceian controversy racked the Dutch
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") Church until long after the death
of both divines, splitting theological faculties into factions.
Eventually both factions compromised, agreeing in many cities to
rotate their pastors between Voetians and
Cocceians.[[2]](http://www.solagratia.org/Articles/The_Life_and_Theology_of_Herman_Witsius_16361708.aspx)
