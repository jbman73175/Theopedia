The term **heterodox** simply means "any opinions or
[doctrines](Doctrine "Doctrine") at variance with the official or
orthodox position."
[[1]](http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn2.0?stage=1&word=heterodoxy).
Used in contrast to [orthodoxy](Orthodoxy "Orthodoxy"), it is
synonymous with the term "unorthodox" and is even closely tied to
the word, "[heresy](Heresy "Heresy")".
