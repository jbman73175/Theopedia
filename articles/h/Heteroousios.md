The [Greek](Greek "Greek") term **heteroousios** was used by
[Arius](Arius "Arius") to describe the [nature](Nature "Nature") of
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). It means "of a different substance" and
thus [Arianism](Arianism "Arianism") seeks to describe Jesus as
being separate from
[God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father"). Reactions
escalated and the result was the
[Council of Nicea](Council_of_Nicea "Council of Nicea") where it
was affirmed that Jesus and the Father were of the same substance
([homoousios](Homoousios "Homoousios")).
