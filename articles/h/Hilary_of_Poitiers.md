**Hilary of Poitiers** (c. 315 - c. 368) was bishop of Poitiers (in
modern France) and an early church theologian from the
West.^[[1]](#note-0)^ He clearly aligned himself with the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") and refused to give
into the pressure of emperor Constantius (son of Constantine) who
asked him to condemn [Athanasius](Athanasius "Athanasius"). Hilary
was a strong opponent of [Arian theology](Arianism "Arianism")
which later earned him the title of "Athanasius of the West."
However, despite his reject of Arianism, Hilary did not entirely
endorse the Greek term [homoousios](Homoousios "Homoousios") to
describe the essence of the Father and Son. He preferred to claim
that the Son was "like" God the Father rather than equal to him, a
statement that Athanasius was unwilling to accept.^[[2]](#note-1)^
Nevertheless, Hilary was an important antagonist of Arian views and
made a substantial contribution to the
[development of Trinitarian theology](Development_of_Trinitarian_theology "Development of Trinitarian theology")
in the West. One of Hilary's best known works was a twelve-book
treatise, *De Trinitate* or *On the Trinity* (356-360). He also
wrote commentaries on the
[Gospel of Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew"),
[Psalms](Psalms "Psalms"), and was the first writer of hymns in
Latin.^[[3]](#note-2)^
