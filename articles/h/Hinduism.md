**Hinduism** is one of the oldest and largest religions in the
world, originating between 1800 and 1000 BC in India with nearly 1
billion
adherents.[[1]](http://www.adherents.com/largecom/com_hindu.html)
Unlike most other major religions, Hinduism has no single founder,
encompasses many religious beliefs, practices, and denominations,
and is looks to a number of key texts for authority, such as the
Vedas, the Upanishads, and the *Bhagavad-Gita*. Hindus believe that
God (Brahman) is a universal spirit that everyone is a part of,
that Jesus (an incarnation of Vishnu) was a guru whose death does
not atone for sins, and that upon death man is reincarnated into
either a better status (good karma) or to suffering (bad karma)
based on their behavior during life.
