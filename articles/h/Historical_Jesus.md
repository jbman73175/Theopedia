The search for the **historical Jesus** deals with what can be
considered historically accurate about
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"). Some have claimed
there is a Christ of faith: the Jesus who the disciples made up,
and a Christ of history: the *real* Jesus who in fact is not
[God](God "God") and did not
[rise from the dead](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus").
Such a dichotomy is false according to orthodox Christian belief.
