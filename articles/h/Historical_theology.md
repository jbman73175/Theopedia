"**Historical theology** integrates the thoughts of other
Christians throughout the centuries since the times of the Bible.
[Church history](Church_history "Church history") is of vital
importance to historical theology since it provides theology the
context in which it was produced and defined.
[Systematic Theology](Systematic_Theology "Systematic Theology")
attempts to create a statement of faith explaining the leading
doctrines of the Christian [Bible](Bible "Bible"). Historical
Theology, then, embodies both of these concepts as a way of
informing theologians as to what has been believed in the past, and
as to what corrections, improvements, or adherence ought to be made
in the present based on that information. Historical Theology was
first prominent in the [Reformation](Reformation "Reformation") and
in its emphasis of returning to the original sources of the Bible
(ad fontes). It is critical that the systematic theologian remember
that it is nearly impossible to do theology as if it has never been
done before. Historical Theology, then, is used both as a pedagogic
tool (for systematic theology) and as a critical tool (highlighting
various important topics through history as key elements of the
Christian faith)." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Why study historical theology?

"First, the study of history provides a *classic mode of learning*.
Examination of primary and secondary sources helps students to
think about their subject rigorously. They must learn to organize
and assess evidence, analyze problems, interpret complex events,
and, finally, to write with clarity and precision. In short,
studying Church History helps students learn how to learn."

"Second, history is *popular*. History's special appeal comes from
its distinctive subject matter, the human past.
[Church History](Church_history "Church history") is interesting
because it deals with real people and events, not with
abstractions. The history of the Christian Church from the earliest
times to the present offers a boundless variety for selecting
favorite topics and pursuing personal interests."

"Third, historical knowledge is *important*. Amnesia is devastating
on the individual level. If I don't know who I am and where I've
come from, then I can't know where I am or should be headed.
Historical amnesia on the institutional level is even more
devastating. For the church to be ignorant of its history is
dangerous because, as George Santayana has observed, "Those who
cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." As the church
continues through the 21st century, it is imperative that its
pastors and teachers know its history. Studying historical theology
. . . equips the leaders of God's church with insight both into
where we have been and, perhaps more importantly, where we should
be headed." ^[[2]](#note-1)^
