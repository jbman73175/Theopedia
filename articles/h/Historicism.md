"**Historicism** teaches that biblical predictions are being
fulfilled throughout history and continue to be fulfilled today.
The Book of Revelation is a pre-written history of the Church from
the time of its writing to the future Second Advent of Christ,
which shall usher in the new heaven and new
earth."^[[1]](#note-0)^
