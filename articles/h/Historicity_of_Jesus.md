The **historicity of Jesus** deals with whether or not
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") actually existed and may involve different
areas of study. Some have sought to simply prove that Jesus
existed, doing so from extra-biblical literature (writings outside
the [Bible](Bible "Bible")). Others seek to prove the authenticity
of his miracles, sayings, and teachings, while some focus on
proving his resurrection, or discrediting the assertions that
things written in the Gospels were untrue.

Necessarily related to this is the
[historicity of the New Testament](Historicity_of_the_New_Testament "Historicity of the New Testament").
If the NT is not reliable, then it cannot be a dependable source
for the study of Jesus.

## The Jesus myth

The Jesus-myth is "the idea that Jesus did not even exist, much
less conduct a ministry as described in the New Testament. . .
Support for the 'Jesus-myth' comes not from historians, but usually
from writers operating far out of their field. . . In spite of the
fact that relevant scholarly consenus is unanimous that the
'Jesus-myth' is incorrect, it continues to be promulgated on a
popular level as though it were absolutely proven." (J. P. Holding)

### Arguments for the Jesus myth

Adherents to the Jesus myth often argue that Jesus is the product
of pagan myths of rising and dying gods. Doctrines such as the
virgin birth, crucifixion, and resurrection were borrowed off
earlier myths of pagan deities such as Osirus, Mithra, and Attis.
In addition to this, it is alleged that there is a lack of
historical evidence for the existence of Jesus.

### Criticism

Almost no serious scholar holds to the first argument, which states
that Jesus was borrowed off pagan myths. Most of these alleged
parallels postdate Christianity and thus show a reversed
dependency. These parallels are also the product of reading
specifically Christian theology into it. Mithra for example, was
born of a rock. Reading Christian terminology into it makes it
sound as if Mithra was born of a virgin. Samuel Sandmel has
referred to this as "Parallelomania."
[[2]](http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/parallelomania_sandmel.pdf)

There is also no lack of historical evidence for the existence
Jesus. In their book *The Case for the Resurrection of Jesus*,
[Gary Habermas](Gary_Habermas "Gary Habermas") and Mike Licona list
more than forty sources which mention Jesus within 150 years within
His life.

## Quotes

-   "I have taken it for granted that Jesus of Nazareth existed.
    Some writers feel a need to justify this assumption at length
    against people who try from time to time to deny it. It would be
    easier, frankly, to believe that Tiberius Caesar, Jesus'
    contemporary, was a figment of the imagination than to believe that
    there never was such a person as Jesus."
    ([N. T. Wright](N._T._Wright "N. T. Wright"),
    *Jesus and the Victory of God*)
