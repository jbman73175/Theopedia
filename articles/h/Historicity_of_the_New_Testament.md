Christianity is "built upon the foundation of faith in the
historical Jesus who is revealed by the historical New Testament
documents. It is of utmost importance that these documents show
themselves to be trustworthy and reliable since they are the
primary documentary sources substantiating the object of the
Christian faith, who is Jesus Christ. Unlike other religious
systems which simply express a code of ethic, morality, and
philosophical ideas, the Bible claims to be God's divine revelation
for all of mankind and it verifies its claims through historical
evidence. As New Testament scholar F.F. Bruce notes, "And this Good
News is intimately bound up with the historical order, for it tells
how the world's redemptive God entered into history, the Eternal
came into time, the Kingdom of heaven invaded the realm of earth,
in the great events of the Incarnation, Crucifixion, and
Resurrection of Jesus the Christ." Given the extraordinary
historical events that the Bible records, it is crucial to
determine two things: (1) The reliability of the New Testament
documents and (2) The reliability of the New Testament witnesses.
If we cannot establish the reliability of these sources, then we
have no objective way to evaluate the historical sayings, deeds,
and claims of Jesus and his disciples."
