The **historicity of the Old Testament** seeks to establish the
historical trustworthiness of the Old Testament. This is based on
two factors: the reliability of the Old Testament manuscripts, and
the reliability of those who were involved with writing and putting
the OT together.

## The reliability of the OT manuscripts

To establish the reliability of the OT manuscripts one must look at
three things: the amount of manuscripts, the dating of them, and
their accuracy.

### Their abundance

As early as the 1700s Benjamin Kennicott published 615 OT
manuscripts, and a few years later Giovani de Rossi published 731
manuscripts. Furthermore, beginning around 1890 around ten thousand
manuscripts were discovered in Cairo Geniza. In addition to these
manuscripts, more were discovered in the caves by the Dead Sea at
Qumran in 1947, also known as the
[Dead Sea Scrolls](Dead_Sea_Scrolls "Dead Sea Scrolls"). The
largest collection of manuscripts in the world, the Second
Firkowitch Collection in Leningrad, contains 1,582 items of Bible
and Masora (manuscripts from the 6th-9th century AD) text, plus
twelve hundred Hebrew fragments
([Norman Geisler](Norman_Geisler "Norman Geisler"),
*Systematic Theology*, vol. 1, p. 439).

### Their dates

Most of the OT manuscripts in our possession are dated between A.D.
800-1100 (Geisler, p. 439). However, due to the discovery of the
Dead Sea Scrolls, dating as far back as the third century B.C., the
accuracy of these later manuscripts has been attested.

### Their accuracy

In evaluating the evidence there is both internal and external
evidence. The Dead Sea Scrolls provide the best external evidence
and show that the later manuscripts that we possess were in fact
preserved through close to 1,000 years. We can be confident that
the texts from the Dead Sea Scrolls were used to transmit the text
that is found in the later documents. Comparative studies have been
made and the results reveal a word-for-word identity in some 95% of
the text (Geisler, p. 441). Due to the help of the
[Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint") (also known as the LXX), we
can also cross-check the accuracy of the transmission of the texts.
Through internal evidence we can view the duplicate passages we
have in the OT (i.e. Isaiah 36-39 and 2 Kings 18-20; Jeremiah 52
and 2 Kings 25, and others) and realize that they are accurate as
well.

## The reliability of the authors

The authors of the OT present real history, about real people, and
in real locations. Much of this has been proven through the finds
of
[biblical archaeology](Biblical_archaeology "Biblical archaeology").
World-renowned archaeologist William F. Albright states, "There can
be no doubt that archaeology has confirmed the substantial
historicity of the Old Testament tradition (Albright,
*Archaeology and Religion of Israel*, p. 176). Nelson Glueck adds
that, "As a matter of fact... it may be stated categorically that
no archaeological discovery has ever controverted a biblical
reference. Scores of archaeological findings have been made which
confirm in clear outline or exact detail statements in the Bible
(Glueck, *Rivers in the Desert*, p. 31). The biblical authors told
the truth, and biblical archaeology has confirmed this without
error.
