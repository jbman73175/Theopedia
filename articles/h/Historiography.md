**Historiography** is concerned with the principles, theories, or
methodology of scholarly historical research and presentation.
Rather than merely the study of a particular history itself,
historiography involves the study of how historical events have
been recorded, interpreted and presented.

## Defining historiography

Furay and Salevouris define "historiography" as "the study of the
way history has been and is written--the history of historical
writing. . . When you study 'historiography' you do not study the
events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of
those events in the works of individual historians." (*Methods*, p.
223)

Gawronski suggests that "historiography is the study of the various
approaches to historical method, the actual writing of history,
and, primarily, the various interpretations of historical events.
Historiography is the study of the techniques employed by the
individual historian." (*History*, pp. 59-60)

Although questions of method have concerned historians since
Thucydides, many trace the modern study of historiography to E. H.
Carr's 1961 work *What is History?.* Carr challenged the
traditional belief that the study of the methods of historical
research and writing were unimportant. His work remains in print to
this day, and is common to many postgraduate programs of study in
both the United States and in Great Britain.

The study of historiography demands a critical approach that goes
beyond the mere examination of historical fact. Historiographical
studies consider the source, often by researching the author, his
or her position in society, and the type of history being written
at the time.

## Christian historiography

Christian historiography as well as a Christian view of history
will necessarily come in conflict with secular or humanist
historiography. This conflict comes from Christian presuppositions
such as: there is a God, God is in control of history, and history
has a moral purpose.
