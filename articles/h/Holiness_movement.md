The **Holiness movement** is an American off-shoot of
[Methodism](Methodism "Methodism") which generally follows the
[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") doctrinal teachings of
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley"). Holiness Christians left
Methodism in the 19th and early 20th centuries because they felt
that mainstream Methodism was failing to emphasize Wesleyan
teachings on [sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification"),
particularly the experience of
[Christian Perfection](Christian_Perfection "Christian Perfection"),
which Holiness theologians usually refer to as
*entire sanctification*, following Wesley's colleague
[John Fletcher](John_Fletcher "John Fletcher"). Among the more
notable Holiness bodies are the Church of the Nazarene and the
Salvation Army.
