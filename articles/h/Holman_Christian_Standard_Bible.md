The **Holman Christian Standard Bible** is an English translation
of the Bible sponsored by LifeWay Christian Resources and published
by Broadman & Holman, both daughter organizations of the
[Southern Baptist Convention](Southern_Baptist_Convention "Southern Baptist Convention").
It was originally conceived as a replacement for the
[NIV](NIV "NIV"), which had become controversial after the
Internation Bible Society acknowledged its intent to revise the
version to include gender-neutral language. The New Testament was
first published in 2001, and the first printed edition of complete
HCSB was published in 2004.

The editorial team for the HCSB included a large contigency of
Southern Baptists, plus Plymouth Brethren, Presbyterians (PCA),
Congregationalists, Church of England, Church of God, Evangelical
Free Church, Methodists, Evangelical Mennonites and Episcopalians,
all of whom were committed to biblical inerrancy. The translation
committee sought to strike a balance between the two prevailing
philosophies of Bible translation, which they called
*Optimal Equivalence*, with a primary goal "to convey a sense of
the original text with as much clarity as possible". They worked
from the [Nestle-Aland](Nestle-Aland "Nestle-Aland")
*Novum Testamentum Graece*, 27th edition, and the United Bible
Societies' *Greek New Testament*, 4th corrected edition (for the
New Testament), and the
[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia](Masoretic_text "Masoretic text"),
5th edition (for the Old Testament).
