The **Holy Spirit** is the name of the third person in the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"), sometimes called the *Holy Ghost*.
Jesus promised the [Apostles](Apostle "Apostle") that he would send
the Holy Spirit after his [crucifixion](Crucifixion "Crucifixion")
and [resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection"):

"But the Helper, the **Holy Spirit**, whom the Father will send in
my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance
all that I have said to you. (John 14:26, [ESV](ESV "ESV"))
In Christian theology the study of the Holy Spirit is called
**pneumatology**, from two Greek words, *pneuma* meaning "wind,"
"breath," or "spirit" and *logos* meaning "word," or "logic."
Generally this includes such topics as the personality of the
Spirit, the deity of the Spirit, and the work of the Spirit as
presented in the [Bible](Bible "Bible").

## The personhood of the Holy Spirit

It is important to establish the fact that the Holy Spirit is a
person. He is often forgotten in the discussion of the
[Father](God_the_Father "God the Father") and the Son, and yet
plays a role within the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") and
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") that is fundamental to the
Christian life. The Holy Spirit is a person who can be grieved (Eph
4:30), bear witness (1 John 5:7), and teach (John 14:26) among many
other things.

*See main page: [Personhood of the Holy Spirit](Personhood_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Personhood of the Holy Spirit")*
## The deity of the Holy Spirit

Establishing the deity of the Holy Spirit is important, especially
regarding the [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"). Although
[Arianism](Arianism "Arianism") taught that [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")
was created by the [Father](God_the_Father "God the Father"), the
view also taught that the Son created the Spirit. It thus remains
important to understand how the Holy Spirit is divine and the
biblical evidence for this conclusion.

*See main page: [Deity of the Holy Spirit](Deity_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Deity of the Holy Spirit")*
## The roles of the Holy Spirit

The roles of the Holy Spirit are evident in both the
[Old](Old_Testament "Old Testament") and
[New Testaments](New_Testament "New Testament"). Most evident is
his work in the
[life and ministry](Jesus’_life_and_ministry "Jesus’ life and ministry")
of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). Today he is seen clearly in the work of
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") and
[sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification") of each
believer.

*See main page: [Roles of the Holy Spirit](index.php?title=Roles_of_the_Holy_Spirit&action=edit&redlink=1 "Roles of the Holy Spirit (page does not exist)")*
## Titles of the Holy Spirit

There are different names, or titles, used to describe the Holy
Spirit in the [Bible](Bible "Bible").

*See main page: [Titles of the Holy Spirit](Titles_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Titles of the Holy Spirit")*
## Other topics

There are other topics indirectly related to the Holy Spirit.
Although they do not deal directly with the *person* and *work* of
the Holy Spirit (as above), most deal with the relationship of the
Holy Spirit and the Church.

### Gifts of the Spirit

*See main page: [Gifts of the Spirit](Gifts_of_the_Spirit "Gifts of the Spirit")*
### Baptism and the Spirit

*See main page: [Baptism of the Holy Spirit](Baptism_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Baptism of the Holy Spirit")*
### Indwelling of the Holy Spirit

*See main page: [Indwelling of the Holy Spirit](Indwelling_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Indwelling of the Holy Spirit")*
### Illumination of the Holy Spirit

*See main page: [Illumination of the Holy Spirit](Illumination_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Illumination of the Holy Spirit")*
### Internal testimony of the Holy Spirit
