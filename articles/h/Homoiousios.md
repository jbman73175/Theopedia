Used by [Eusebius](Eusebius "Eusebius") of Caesarea,
**homoiousios** means "of a similar substance". This is in contrast
to the Nicene affirmation that [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") and
[God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father") are
[homoousios](Homoousios "Homoousios"), "of the same substance."
Christians at that time believed that even if they were of
*similar* substance, the result was a Jesus who was *not* identical
with the redemptive God of the Old Testament. Furthermore, if he
had a similar divine substance, an immediate problem arises with
the doctrine of [monotheism](Monotheism "Monotheism"). Thus, at the
[Council of Nicea](Council_of_Nicea "Council of Nicea") the church
affirmed that Jesus and the Father were of the *same* substance.
