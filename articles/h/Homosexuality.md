**Homosexuality** is the indulgence of sexual desire, or romantic
love, for persons of the same gender. It is strongly condemned in
the Bible in both the Old and the New Testaments, (e.g. Lev. 18:22
and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10).

Homosexuality is not a devotion to, admiration for, friendship
with, or preference for the company of persons of the same gender,
regardless of how strong or devoted it may be. Neither, on the
other hand, is homosexuality definable as a discomfort with, or
distaste for, the company of persons of the opposite gender.
Homosexuality specifically concerns yielding one's imagination,
speech, or will to erotic and romantic passions toward people of
the same sex.

## Passages related to Homosexuality

### Genesis 19 (cf. 2 Peter 2:7 and Jude 7)

### Leviticus 18:22

> You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.

### Leviticus 20:13

> If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.

### Romans 1:26-27

> For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.

Denny Burk writes,

> "For Paul, nature (φύσις word group) is not a reference to one’s
own private sexual orientation. Nature refers to the creational
purposes of God in the primeval event of making male and female. To
depart from nature is to depart from the heterosexual norm
established in Gen 1–2. Scroggs’s pederasty proposal fails because
there is not one scintilla of evidence in the text that Paul is
talking about relationships between men and boys. Paul speaks of
ἄρσενες ἐν ἄρσεσιν (lit., males in males) in Rom 1:27 without
saying anything about young boys. Paul condemns same-sex relations
between females in verse 26, but there is no evidence from
antiquity that women and young girls are in view. Thus, in both
verses 26 and 27, Paul is prohibiting same-sex relations in
general... The traditional understanding still holds in many if not
most of the major critical
commentaries."[[1]](http://www.thegospelcoalition.org/publications/35-2/why-evangelicals-should-ignore-brian-mclaren-how-the-new-testament-requires-evangelicals-to-render-a-judgment-on-the-moral-status-of-homosexuality)

### 1 Corinthians 6:9-10

> Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.

### 1 Timothy 1:10

*...the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine*

## Al Mohler on homosexuality

In a *Time Magazine* article,
[An Evangelical's Concession on Gays](http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1599987,00.html),
by Michael Lindenberger (*Time Magazine*),
[Albert Mohler](Albert_Mohler "Albert Mohler") is reported to have
argued that genetic inclination toward any behavior does *not*
imply that such a behavior is "normal" in an ethical sense. In
contrast, some argue that, should a genetic cause be found this
would decisively show homosexuality to be an aspect of the person's
God-given identity and therefore not a sin; but this is not
Mohler's view. What is novel in Mohler's comments is his
controversial, implied acceptance as a scientifically settled fact
that same-sex attraction is genetically determined, in his remark:
"We sin against homosexuals by insisting that sexual temptation and
attraction are predominately chosen". But by separating the issue
of genetics from the Bible's own concern, Mohler is following the
established Biblical understanding of how genetic considerations
are included in the issue of how men ought to conduct themselves in
the war between the lusts of the body and the Spirit of God. Romans
7 vividly describes inclinations toward what God condemns, which
work like an innate and irresistible law within the body, so that
no one is able to do what is right or to resist doing wrong simply
by approving what is right and condemning what is wrong.

Mohler also writes,

> We cannot lie to persons about the sinfulness of their sin, nor
comfort them with falsehood about their moral accountability before
God. The rush of the liberal churches and denominations to
normalize homosexuality is now a hallmark of their disobedience to
the Bible.
But this is not the end of the matter, and we know it. When gay
activists accuse conservative Christians of homophobia, they are
wrong. Our concern about the sinfulness of homosexuality is not
rooted in fear, but in faithfulness to the Bible — and faithfulness
means telling the truth.
Yet, when gay activists accuse conservative Christians of
homophobia, they are also right. Much of our response to
homosexuality is rooted in ignorance and fear. We speak of
homosexuals as a particular class of especially depraved sinners
and we lie about how homosexuals experience their own struggle. Far
too many evangelical pastors talk about sexual orientation with a
crude dismissal or with glib assurances that gay persons simply
choose to be gay. While most evangelicals know that the Bible
condemns homosexuality, far too many find comfort in their own
moralism, consigning homosexuals to a theological or moral category
all their
own.[[2]](http://www.albertmohler.com/2010/10/04/between-the-boy-and-the-bridge-a-haunting-question/)
“But we as evangelicals have a very sad history in dealing with
this issue,” he continued. “We have told not the truth, but we have
told about half the truth. We’ve told the biblical truth, and
that’s important, but we haven’t applied it in the biblical way.”
“We have said to people that homosexuality is just a choice,”
Mohler said. “It’s clear that it’s more than a choice. That doesn’t
mean it’s any less sinful, but it does mean it’s not something
people can just turn on and turn off. We are not a gospel people
unless we understand that only the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
gives a homosexual person any hope of release from homosexuality.”

## John Frame on Innateness

> "Innateness has nothing to do with normality... Genes may impel,
but they don’t compel... All of us have moral 'weak spots,' areas
where we are especially vulnerable to the Devil’s enticements.
These areas of temptation have many sources, heredity being one of
them. Others may be environment, experiences, and our own past
decisions...
"Would a genetic basis for homosexuality eliminate the element of
'choice?' Certainly not. A person with a genetic propensity for
alcoholism still makes a choice when he decides to take a drink,
and then another, and then another. The same is true for an xyy
male who decides to punch somebody in the nose. If we assume the
existence of a genetic propensity for homosexuality, it is true
that those with that makeup face greater temptation in this area
than others. But those who succumb to the temptation do choose to
do so, as do all of us when we succumb to our own besetting
temptations. Homosexuals certainly choose not to remain celibate,
and they choose to have sexual relations. They are not forced to do
this by their genes or by anything contrary to their own desires...
"If it were true that repentant homosexuals continued to experience
homosexual temptation, it would not cast the slightest doubt on the
power of God’s grace to heal such people."

## Jonathan Edwards on humility

Jonathan Edwards once resolved:

> "... to act, in all respects, both speaking and doing, as if nobody
had been so vile as I, and as if I had committed the same sins, or
had the same infirmities or failings as others; and that I will let
the knowledge of their failings promote nothing but shame in
myself, and prove only an occasion of my confessing my own sins and
misery to
God."[[5]](http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/articles/the-resolutions-of-jonathan-edwards)
