Horace Bushnell
**Horace Bushnell** (1802 – 1876) was an American Congregational
clergyman and [theologian](Theologian "Theologian"). Bushnell was
born in the village of Bantam, township of Litchfield, Connecticut.
He graduated at Yale in 1827, was literary editor of the New York
Journal of Commerce from 1828–1829, and in 1829 became a tutor at
Yale. Here he initially studied law, but in 1831 he entered the
theology department of Yale College. In May, 1833 Bushnell was
ordained pastor of the North Congregational church in Hartford,
Connecticut, where he remained until 1859, when due to extended
poor health he resigned his pastorate. Thereafter he held no
appointed office, but, until his death at Hartford in 1876, he was
a prolific author and occasionally preached.

## Career

While in California in 1856, for the restoration of his health, he
took an active interest in the organization, at Oakland, of the
College of California (chartered in 1855 and merged with the
University of California in 1869), the presidency of which he
declined. As a preacher, Dr Bushnell very effective. Though not a
dramatic orator, he was original, thoughtful and impressive in the
pulpit. His theological position may be said to have been one of
qualified revolt against the [Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism")
orthodoxy of his day. He criticized prevailing conceptions of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"), the
[atonement](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ"), conversion,
and the relations of the natural and the supernatural. Above all,
he broke with the prevalent view which regarded theology as
essentially intellectual in its appeal and demonstrable by
processes of exact logical deduction. To his thinking its proper
basis is to be found in the feelings and intuitions of humankind's
spiritual nature. He had a marked influence upon theology in
America, an influence not so much, possibly, in the direction of
the modification of specific doctrines as in the impulse and
tendency and general spirit which he imparted to theological
thought. Dr Munger's estimate was that "He was a theologian as
Copernicus was an astronomer; he changed the point of view, and
thus not only changed everything, but pointed the way toward unity
in theological thought." He was not exact, but he put God and
humanity and the world into a relation that thought can accept
while it goes on to state it more fully with ever growing
knowledge. Other thinkers were moving in the same direction; he led
the movement in New England, and wrought out a great deliverance.
It was a work of superb courage. Hardly a theologian in his
denomination stood by him, and nearly all pronounced against him.

Four of his books were of particular importance:
*Christian Nurture* (1847), in which he virtually opposed
revivalism and effectively turned the current of Christian thought
toward the young ; *Nature and the Supernatural* (1858), in which
he discussed miracles and endeavoured to lift the natural into the
supernatural by emphasizing the supernatural nature of man; The
*Vicarious Sacrifice* (1866), in which he contended for what has
come to be known as the
[moral view of the atonement](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ")
in distinction from the
[governmental](Governmental_theory_of_atonement "Governmental theory of atonement")
and the
[penal or satisfaction](Penal_substitution_theory_of_the_atonement "Penal substitution theory of the atonement")
theories; and *God in Christ* (1849) (with an introductory
Dissertation on Language as related to Thought and Spirit), in
which he expressed, it was charged, [heretical](Heresy "Heresy")
views as to the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"), holding, among other
things, that the Godhead is instrumentally three simply as related
to our finite apprehension, and the communication of Gods
incommunicable nature. Attempts were made to bring him to trial,
but they were unsuccessful, and in 1852 his church unanimously
withdrew from the local consociation, thus removing any possibility
of further action against him. To his critics Bushnell formally
replied by writing *Christ in Theology* (1851), in which he employs
the important argument that spiritual truth can be expressed only
in approximate and poetical language, and concludes that an
adequate dogmatic theology cannot exist. That he did not deny the
divinity of Christ he proved in
*The Character of Jesus, forbidding his possible Classification within Men*
(1861).

An edition of his works, in eleven volumes, appeared in 1876; and a
further volume, gathered from his unpublished papers, as
*The Spirit in Man: Sermons and Selections*, in 1903. New editions
of his *Nature and the Supernatural*, *Sermons for this New Life*,
and *Work and Play*, were published the same year.
