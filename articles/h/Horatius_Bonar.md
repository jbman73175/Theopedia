Horatius Bonar
**Horatius Bonar** (1808 - 1889) was a Scottish churchman and
poet.

The son of James Bonar, Solicitor of Exise for Scotland, he was
born and educated in Edinburgh. He entered the Ministry of the
Church of Scotland, and settled at Kelso. He joined the Free Church
at the time of the "Disruption" in 1843, and in 1867 was moved to
Edinburgh. In 1853 he was made D.D. of Aberdeen. He was a
[premillenarian](Premillennialism "Premillennialism") and expressed
his views in books, such as *Prophetical Landmarks* (London, 1847),
and in the *Quarterly Journal of Prophecy*, which he founded in
1849.

He was a voluminous and highly popular author, and in addition to
many books and tracts wrote a number of hymns, many of which, e.g.,
"I heard the voice of Jesus say," and "What a friend we have in
Jesus," became known all over the English-speaking world. A
selection of these was published as *Hymns of Faith and Hope* (3
series). His last volume of poetry was *My Old Letters*.

His youngest brother [Andrew Bonar](Andrew_Bonar "Andrew Bonar")
was also a well-known Christian writer and minister of the Free
Church of Scotland.
