**Howell Harris** (1714-1773) was one of the main leaders of the
Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century, along with Daniel
Rowland and William Williams Pantycelyn.

Born at Talgarth in Brecknockshire (Wales) in 1714, he underwent a
religious conversion in 1735 while listening to a sermon by the
Rev. Pryce Davies in the parish church on the neccesity of
partaking of [Holy Communion](Communion "Communion"). His
"[Methodist](Methodist "Methodist")" views prevented his ordination
in the [Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England"),
so he became a travelling preacher, tireless in his determination
to spread the word throughout Wales.

He was effectively the founder of the Presbyterian church of Wales,
also known as the Calvinistic Methodist church.
