**Hugh Stowell Brown** (10 August 1823 - 24 February 1886)
Christian minister and renowned preacher.

Hugh Stowell Brown was a preacher, pastor and social reformer in
Liverpool in the nineteenth century. His public lectures and work
among the poor brought him great renown. On his death a statue was
raised to him, one of only three Liverpool clergymen to receive
that honour. His brother was the Manx poet Thomas Edward Brown.

## Life

Hugh Stowell Brown was born in Douglas in the Isle of Man, the son
of a very low church Anglican vicar.

At 11 years of age he was taken out of school to read to his
father, who was then threatened with blindness. In this way, he
acquired a fund of miscellaneous information which was afterwards
of great use to him.

In 1839, he went to England to learn land-surveying, and obtained
an appointment on the Ordnance Survey. But he gave it up almost at
once, and in 1840, we find him in the London and Birmingham railway
engine shop at Wolverton. At this time he became a teetotaller and
a Sunday-school teacher.

By the end of 1843, he had decided to be an Anglican vicar and went
to College on the Isle of Man. But he was never convinced that it
was right to baptise babies and in 1846 he gave up his studies
because he realised his beliefs were Baptist.

In 1847 he travelled to Liverpool to preach at Myrtle Street
Baptist Chapel, only having previously delivered a few sermons, and
by his own admission did not speak well. But the church realised
this was a young man with a lot to offer and they took him on as
their minister.

In this position he continued during the rest of his life, and
became one of Liverpool's greatest ever citizens.

His preaching was simple and direct, and humorous, full of homely
proverbs and epigram. His speaking attracted the rich and powerful
and the poor and uneducated. When he went to Myrtle Street the
church had 239 members; 40 years later in 1884, it had 849
members.

But it was not only the congregation that benefited from his work.
In 1851, he began a series of popular Sunday afternoon lectures in
St George's Hall. Also in the summer evenings he spoke to large
audiences of working class people who felt that they didn't have
the right clothes to go to church â€“ often a crowd of three to four
thousand.

Through his work many of the poorer people were encouraged to put
their money in the "Workman's Bank" established by his church in
1861. This helped people to develop habits of saving, and saved
many hundreds of people from poverty.

In 1873, he visited the United States of America, when he recorded
his opinion that that country would have "a future of greatness
that has never been equalled in the history of the world."

During the last ten years of his life his name as a preacher had
become a household word in Liverpool, and honours of various kinds
were bestowed upon him. He became President of the
[Baptist Union of Great Britain](index.php?title=Baptist_Union_of_Great_Britain&action=edit&redlink=1 "Baptist Union of Great Britain (page does not exist)"),
President of the Liverpool Branch of the Peace Society, and
Chairman of the Liverpool Seamen's Friendly Society.

The son of Hugh Stowell Brown, J. Sirrett Brown founded the firm of
Brown and Backhouse of Liverpool. He built many properties
including The Hotel Victoria, New Brighton, Warren Point in Warren
Drive and many more in the area. H.S. Brown's Grandson of the same
name is still alive and in a nursing home in Wallasey, Wirral.

## Statue

Soon after his death a statue of Hugh Stowell Brown was paid for by
public subscription. The Statue was unveiled on Tuesday 15th
October 1889 in the churchyard at the front of Myrtle Street
Baptist Church opposite the Philharmonic Hall. In 1939 Myrtle
Street church was closed and subsequently demolished, and the site
is now a car park. The statue was moved to Princes Road/Avenue,
Liverpool on Saturday 25th September 1954. The statue was then
removed around the time that the William Huskisson was toppled from
its pedestal in 1988. The now empty pedestal still stands close to
Princes Park gates. The statue which is in poor condition is now
lying forlornly in the stable yard at Croxteth Hall in Liverpool.
