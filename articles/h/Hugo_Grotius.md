Hugo Grotius
**Hugo Grotius** (1583-1645) a renowned jurist in the Dutch
Republic, laid the foundations for international law, based on
natural law. He was also a philosopher, Christian apologist,
playwright, and poet.

One of the pioneering natural rights theorists of the late 16th and
early 17th centuries, Grotius defined natural law as a perceptive
judgement in which things are good or bad by their own nature. This
was a break from Calvinist ideals, in that God was no longer the
only source of ethical qualities. Grotius' conception of the nature
of natural law is set forth in his *De Jure Belli ac Pacis* (On the
Law of War and Peace), published in 1625.^[[1]](#note-0)^ In it
Grotius contended that natural law prescribes rules of conduct for
nations as well as for private individuals. He derived much of the
specific content of international law from the Bible and from
classical history. Although he did not condemn war as an instrument
of national policy, he maintained that it was criminal to wage war
except for certain causes.^[[2]](#note-1)^

In Dutch political affairs Grotius supported Oldenbarneveldt
against Maurice of Nassau . After Maurice gained power he had
Grotius condemned (1619) to prison for life, but Grotius made a
daring escape in 1621 and fled to Paris.^[[3]](#note-2)^
