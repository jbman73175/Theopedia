Huldreich Zwingli
**Huldreich** (or **Ulrich**) **Zwingli** (1484-1531) was the
leader of the Swiss [Reformation](Reformation "Reformation"), and
founder of the Swiss Reformed Churches. Independent from
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"), Zwingli arrived at
similar conclusions in his own personal study of the Scriptures.
Zwingli is perhaps best known today for his teaching that the
Lord's Supper is purely symbolic, as opposed to the
[Transubstantiation](Transubstantiation "Transubstantiation") view
of Roman Catholicism or the
[Consubstantiation](Consubstantiation "Consubstantiation") view
adopted by Luther -- there was great animosity between
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") and he on this
issue.

Zwingli was born in Wildhaus, St. Gall, Switzerland to a prominent
family of the middle classes. He was the third of eight sons. His
father Ulrich was the chief magistrate in town, and his uncle
Bartolomeus the vicar.

Zwingli's Reformation was supported by the magistrate and
population of Zürich, and led to significant changes in civil life,
and state matters in Zürich. In particular, this movement was known
for mercilessly persecuting Anabaptists and other followers of
Christ who maintained a nonresistant stance. The reformation was
spread from Zürich to five other cantons of Switzerland, while the
remaining five sternly held on to the Roman Catholic faith.

Zwingli was killed in 1531 at Kappel am Albis, while serving as a
military chaplain in a battle against the Catholic cantons.
