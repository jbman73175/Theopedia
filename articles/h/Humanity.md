The [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of **humanity**, also called
**anthropology**, is an area of
[Christian theology](Systematic_theology "Systematic theology")
that studies various topics related to mankind based on the
teaching of Scripture.

For example, a biblical anthropology maintains as a basis, that:

-   Man was created in [God's image](Image_of_God "Image of God")
    (Genesis 1:26-27).
-   Man is a [fallen](The_Fall "The Fall") creature (Romans 5:12),
    and born in a corrupt state.
-   Man has a material aspect (the body) and a non-material aspect,
    his spirit (Jas. 2:26).
-   Though marred by the Fall, man retains remnants of God's image
    in his non-material nature (Gen. 9:6).

Some differentiate the *soul* from the *spirit* of man resulting in
a trichotomous view of his nature (body, soul, and spirit). Others
see the soul as essentially synonymous with the spirit resulting in
a dichotomous view of man's nature (material and immaterial), which
may be expressed as either "body and soul" or "body and spirit."

## Created humanity

"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he
created them; male and female he created them" (Gen 1:27). Human
beings are crated in God's image in which they were made to coexist
as man and woman in community. As created beings, humans are finite
and dependent on God for all things.

## Body, soul, and spirit

### Trichotomy

Trichotomy is the view that humanity is composed of three distinct
parts: body, soul, and spirit. Some adherents to this view believe
the spirit a range of capacities within the soul. The primary text
used by proponents of the trichotomous view of man is Genesis
1:26-27, where God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our
likeness," thus appealing to the analogy of the Trinity (comparing
the three *natures* of man with the three *persons* of God).

The biblical languages make a distinction between soul and spirit,
using two totally different words, meaning two totally different
things. The Hebrew word translated spirit, *ne shamah* ("wind"),
corresponds to the Greek word for spirit, *pneuma* ("breeze"),
while the Hebrew word translated soul, *nephesh* ("living
(thinking) being") corresponds to the Greek word, *psuche* (also
"living (thinking) being").

Other Scriptures which seem to make the distinction between
*spirit* and *soul* include Luke 1:46-47, where Mary said, "My soul
magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior," and
Matthew 26:38-41, where Jesus said "My soul is very sorrowful, even
to death..." when exhorting the disciples to watch and pray with
Him, and then upon returning to find them sleeping said, "The
spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."

### Dichotomy

"In contrast to trichotomy, the view accepted by most scholars is
that man is dichotomous, or consists of two parts; a material
aspect, and a non-material aspect. The non-material part is called
by many different names; soul, spirit, mind, life force, or any of
a dozen or more equivalent Scriptural words. These are not separate
parts of a person, but are just different words for the different
aspects of the non-material aspect of man."

#### Relevant passages

-   "Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and
    may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the
    coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." - 1 Thessalonians 5:23
-   "For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any
    two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of
    joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of
    the heart." - Hebrews 4:12
-   "For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is
    unfruitful." - 1 Corinthians 14:14
-   "And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the
    soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
    - Matthew 10:28

### Views on the Origin of the Soul

#### Pre-existentialism

"Some advocated the idea that the souls of men existed in a
previous state, and that something that happened then accounts for
their present condition. A few found in this an explanation of the
fact that man is born as a sinner. This view finds no favor now."
[Berkhoff](http://www.mbrem.com/shorttakes/berk11.htm)

#### Traducianism

"According to this View men derive their souls as well as their
bodies from their parents. This is the common view in the Lutheran
Church. Support for it is found in the fact that nothing is said
about the creation of Eve's soul, and that descendants are said to
be in the loins of their Fathers, Gen. 46:26; Heb. 7:9, 10.
Furthermore, it seems to be favored by the fact that in the case of
animals both body and soul are passed on from the old to the young,
by the inheritance of family traits and peculiarities, and by the
inheritance of sinful corruption, which is a matter of the soul
more than of the body. However, it is burdened with serious
difficulties. It either makes the parents creators, or assumes that
the soul of man can be divided into various parts. Moreover, it
endangers the sinlessness of Jesus."
[Berkhoff](http://www.mbrem.com/shorttakes/berk11.htm)

*See main page: [Traducianism](Traducianism "Traducianism")*
#### Soul-creationism

"This holds that each soul is a direct creation of God, of which
the time cannot be precisely determined. The soul is supposed to be
created pure, but to become sinful even before birth by entering
into that complex of sin by which humanity as a whole is burdened.
This view is common in Reformed circles. It is favored by the fact
that Scripture represents the body and the soul of man as having
different origins, Eccl. 12:7; Isa. 42:5; Zech. 12:1; Heb. 12:9.
Moreover, it is more in harmony with the spiritual nature of the
soul, and safeguards the sinlessness of Jesus. It is not free from
difficulties, however. It does not explain the inheritance of
family traits, and may seem to make God the Creator of sinful
souls." [Berkhoff](http://www.mbrem.com/shorttakes/berk11.htm)

## Fallen humanity

After the Fall, sin entered the world and effected the human
condition. Both sin and guilt were now inherited and resulted in
death.

Total depravity (also called **total inability** or
**total corruption**) is a biblical [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine")
closely linked with the doctrine of
[original sin](Original_sin "Original sin") as formalized by
[Augustine](Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo") and advocated
in many Protestant confessions of faith and catechisms, especially
in [Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"). The doctrine understands the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") to teach that, as a consequence of the
[the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall") of man, every person born into the
world is morally corrupt, enslaved to [sin](Sin "Sin") and is,
apart from the grace of God, utterly unable to choose to follow
[God](God "God") or choose to turn to Christ in faith for
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation").

*See main pages: [The Fall](The_Fall "The Fall"), [Original sin](Original_sin "Original sin"), [Death](Death "Death"), [Total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity")*
## New humanity

While the effects of the Fall left humanity in a sinful condition,
freedom from the bondage of sin was accomplished on the cross and
through Jesus' resurrection. Those who have been united with Christ
are new creatures and await the complete restoration of their
humanity at the final resurrection.
