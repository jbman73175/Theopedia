The **humanity of Jesus** is as essential to the Christian faith as
his deity. The New Testament teaching and the orthodox Christian
position regarding the Person of Christ is that
**Jesus is truly God and truly man** in the fullest sense of the
terms. In His Person is a union of two distinct natures -- human
and divine. In this union the two natures did not combine or
confuse so as to produce a unique, third kind of nature; nor was
there a dual personality. Rather, the product was a single unique
Person, a Person with
[two natures](Hypostatic_Union "Hypostatic Union"). Jesus is truly
human in every essential aspect. Indeed, Jesus,
[being sinless](Sinlessness_of_Jesus "Sinlessness of Jesus"), is
the most authentic human being who ever lived.

Only as man can Jesus truly represent men to God, (Heb. 2:17). He
understands our lives because He has lived it also, (Heb. 2:18).
Because He understands, coming to Him we "obtain mercy and find
grace to help in time of need," (Heb. 4:15-16). As man He provided
for us the pattern for living as men, (1 Pet. 2:21).
