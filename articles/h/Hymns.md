**Hymns** are one of the styles of [music](Music "Music")
prescribed for singing in Christian [worship](Worship "Worship")
(Cf. Ephesians 5:19 - "...addressing one another in *psalms* and
*hymns* and *spiritual songs*..."; Colossians 3:16 - "...teaching
and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing *psalms* and
*hymns* and *spiritual songs*...") The Greek term used is *humnos*
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#5215](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=5215&version=nas)]*^),
which simply means a song of praise or celebration, with little to
distinguish it from the other two.
[Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge") explains:

"The early usage of the words... appears to have been as loose as
that of the corresponding English terms, psalm, hymn, song, is with
us. A psalm was a hymn, and a hymn a song. Still there was a
distinction between them as there is still. A psalm was... a song
designed to be sung with the accompaniment of instrumental
music;... one of the sacred poems contained in the book of
Psalms;... [or] Any sacred poem formed on the model of the Old
Testament Psalms... A Hymn was a song of praise to God; a divine
song..."^[[1]](#note-0)^

## History

In the [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament"), the people
of God sang psalms in praise of his name and all that he had done
for them. We have examples of songs being sung by
[Israel](Israel "Israel") from the very beginning, when they were
brought out of Egypt, across the Red Sea. In the New Testament, we
have a record of the singing of hymns. Jesus and his disciples sang
a hymn before going out to the Mount of Olives, and Paul instructs
the churches at Ephesus and Colosse to sing psalms, hymns and
spiritual songs. It is suggested that Philippians 2, "Who being in
very nature God...", is an example of an early church hymn; and the
Book of Revelation resounds with the praises of God in song.

As church history continued, we find that passages of Scripture
were frequently sung, including, as already mentioned, the
[Psalms](Psalms "Psalms"), but also passages like the
*[Magnificat](Magnificat "Magnificat")*. By the second century,
privately composed psalms like the
*[Gloria](index.php?title=Gloria&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gloria (page does not exist)")*
were being sung; these eventually made their way into the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic")
[Mass](Mass "Mass"), and from there have enjoyed their current
popularity.

Hymns continued to be written as Christians expressed their faith
in song. We have examples of hymns in Latin and Greek from
throughout the post-classical period and the middle ages. However,
the ossification of Latin as the language of the Church, even when
it was no longer the *lingua franca*, meant that hymns started to
drift away from being written in the common tongue. It was not
until the Reformation that
[church services](index.php?title=Church_service&action=edit&redlink=1 "Church service (page does not exist)")
were once more heard in a language that people would understand,
and by then, the writing of hymns had fallen somewhat out of
favour, although not altogether.

The German Reformer,
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"), wrote hymns for the
new Protestant movement, including the famous
*[Ein feste Burg](index.php?title=Ein_feste_Burg&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ein feste Burg (page does not exist)")*,
but the early English churches sang Scriptural paraphrases almost
exclusively. We owe them a debt for work such as the
[Old Hundredth](index.php?title=Old_Hundredth&action=edit&redlink=1 "Old Hundredth (page does not exist)"),
but it was not until
[Isaac Watts](index.php?title=Isaac_Watts&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isaac Watts (page does not exist)")
(1674–1748) that the first English-language hymn which was not a
direct paraphrase of Scripture appeared. After Watts, who wrote
hymns prolifically, hymnody flourished.
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley") wrote a great many popular
hymns, and the
[Great Awakenings](Great_Awakening "Great Awakening") in America
occasioned the writing of yet more.

Modern hymn-writing continues to grow, with people like
[Stuart Townend](index.php?title=Stuart_Townend&action=edit&redlink=1 "Stuart Townend (page does not exist)")
producing well-loved hymns, while the changes in musical style have
also led to the writing of choruses and modern songs, which share
aspects in common with traditional hymns, while differing in style
or development.
