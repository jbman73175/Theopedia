The term **Hyper-Calvinism** refers primarily to a theological
position that historically arose from within the
[Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") tradition among the early
English [Particular Baptists](Strict_Baptist "Strict Baptist") in
the mid 1700's. It can be seen in the teachings of men like Joseph
Hussey (d. 1726), Lewis Wayman (d. 1764),
[John Brine](John_Brine "John Brine") (d. 1765), and to some extent
in [John Gill](John_Gill "John Gill") (d. 1771).

It is called Hyper-Calvinism by its critics, who maintain that it
deviates from the biblical [gospel](Gospel "Gospel") by (1) denying
that the call of the gospel to repent and believe is universal,
i.e. for all alike, and (2) denying that the unregenerate (natural)
man has a duty to repent and believe in Christ for salvation.

This theological position was labeled Hyper-Calvinism in the mid
1700’s as the issue was argued and debated among English Baptists
and others. It should be noted that, although Hyper-Calvinism
became fairly widespread among the English Particular Baptists of
that day, not all Particular Baptists agreed with the extremes of
Wayman and Brine.

While this doctrine has always been a minority view, it has not
been relegated to the past and may still be found in some small
denominations and church communities today.

## Non-technical usage of the term

The prefix “hyper” may be used generically to refer to anything
that is considered “extreme” or which goes beyond the accepted
norm. There is therefore a sense in which one may refer to
Calvinistic views regarded as going beyond normal Calvinism as
“hyper.” This non-technical use, usually as a pejorative term, has
been applied to a variety of theological positions which fall
outside mainstream Calvinism:

-   that God is the source of sin and of evil
-   that men have no will of their own, and secondary causes are of
    no effect
-   that it is wrong to [evangelize](Evangelism "Evangelism")
-   that God does not command everyone to repent
-   that there is no [common grace](Common_grace "Common grace"),
    i.e. God only cares for his elect and has nothing but hatred for
    the non-elect.
-   that no government is to be obeyed which does not acknowledge
    that Jesus is the Lord over it, or that Biblical Law is its source
    of authority
-   that only Calvinists are Christians

## Source quotations

The archetypal Hyper-Calvinist position may be found explicitly set
forth in the confessional articles of the Gospel Standard (Baptist)
Churches, specifically:
*Articles of Faith of the Gospel Standard Aid and Poor Relief Societies*,
(Leicester, England: Oldham & Manton Ltd., n.d.) -- most recently
seen online [here](http://www.5solas.org/media.php?id=574).

**Article XXVI of the Gospel Standard articles:** "We deny duty
faith and duty repentance – these terms suggesting that it is every
man’s duty spiritually and savingly to repent and believe. We deny
also that there is any capability in man by nature to any spiritual
good whatever. So that we reject the doctrine that man in a state
of nature should be exhorted to believe in or turn to God."

**Article XXXIII of the Gospel Standard articles:** "Therefore,
that for ministers in the present day to address unconverted
persons, or indiscriminately all in a mixed congregation, calling
upon them to savingly repent, believe, and receive Christ, or
perform any other acts dependent upon the new creative power of the
Holy Ghost, is, on the one hand, to imply creature power, and on
the other, to deny the doctrine of special redemption."

## Example Logic of the Hyper-Calvinist

Wayman contends that saving faith was not in the power of man at
his best before the fall and therefore makes the following
deduction, "What Adam had, we all had in him; and what Adam lost,
we all lost in him, and are debtors to God on both accounts; but
Adam had not the faith of God’s elect before the fall, and did not
lose it for his posterity; therefore they are not debtors to God
for it while in unregeneracy." Lewis Wayman,
*A Further Enquiry after Truth*, (London: J & J. Marshall, 1738),
p. 51.

John Brine gives some insight into Wayman’s statement. Brine taught
that every duty incumbent on Adam in his unfallen state he also had
the ability to perform, and this duty extends to all men in their
fallen state regardless of their lack of ability. Brine maintained
that a lack of ability does not release a man from duty (with which
most Calvinists would agree). Yet, somehow he sees salvation in a
different category; for "with respect to special faith in Christ,
it seems to me," says Brine, "that the powers of man in his
perfected state were not fitted and disposed to that act." John
Brine, *A Refutation of Arminian Principles* (London, 1743), p. 5.

Accordingly, saving faith lay not within the powers of man in his
unfallen state, because there was no necessity for it. Since,
therefore, it was not part of his powers in his unfallen state, it
could not now be required of him in his fallen state. On this
basis, duty-faith and duty-repentance are denied by the hyper
Calvinist.

## Historic Calvinist position compared to Hyper-Calvinism

Historic Calvinists regard repentance and faith as the means by
which the great commandment to love God and love our neighbor finds
fulfillment. This duty to love God and neighbor existed before the
fall and Adam certainly enjoyed the ability to do so. Man's love of
God is therefore still obligatory, and the means through which it
is to be realized, namely repentance and faith, are likewise
obligatory. Man owes God his love and trust by the very fact that
he is God's rational creature. Adam had the ability to love and
trust God before the Fall. Man is still responsible to love and
trust God even though, because of the Fall and while in an
unregenerate state, he has lost the moral ability to do so.
Therefore, contrary to hyper-Calvinism, fallen man is indeed
duty-bound to repent and believe in Christ for salvation.
