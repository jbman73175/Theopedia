**Hyper-dispensationalism** (or sometimes
**ultra-dispensationalism**), as opposed to traditional (or
classic)
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism"), views
the start of the Christian church as beginning with the ministry of
the [Apostle Paul](Apostle_Paul "Apostle Paul") after the early
part of the book of Acts. Although variations exist in specifics,
all hyper-dispensationalists view the four Gospels and many of
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") Epistles as applying
to the pre-Pauline Jewish-Christian church or to the future
[Davidic Kingdom](Millennial_Kingdom "Millennial Kingdom"); not
directly applicable to the predominantly
[Gentile](Gentile "Gentile") Church of today.

"Dispensationalists distinguish Israel from the church and so look
for a point in history at which God's redemptive program changed
from the one form of administration to the other. The most common
dispensationalism finds the beginning of the church in Acts 2 with
the Spirit's coming at Pentecost. From the standpoint of Acts 2
dispensationalism two other views seem extreme, or "ultra."
According to Acts 13 dispensationalism the church began when Paul
started his mission to Jews and Gentiles (Acts 13:2). According to
Acts 28 dispensationalism the church began toward the end of Paul's
ministry with his reference to Israel's rejection of the kingdom of
God and the sending of God's salvation to the Gentiles (Acts
28:26-28)."^[[1]](#note-0)^

The most notable proponent of **Acts-28** Dispensationalism was
[E. W. Bullinger](E._W._Bullinger "E. W. Bullinger") (1837-1913).
Other writers holding this position include Charles H. Welch,
Vladimir M. Gelesnoff, and Otis Q. Sellers. Spokesmen for the
Acts-13, or **Mid-Acts** Dispensationalists, include J. C. O'Hair,
C. R. Stam (*Things That Differ*), Charles F. Baker
(*A Dispensational Theology*), and Bob Enyart (*The Plot*).

## Hyper versus Ultra

While Hyper-dispensationalism is a not a label most Mid-Acts
Dispensationalists would readily accept, they prefer that the term
"Ultra-dispensational" be reserved for Bullinger and the Acts-28
end of the spectrum.^[[2]](#note-1)^ In fact, if the classical
Scofield variety may be termed as Acts-2 dispensationalism, then
there is indeed a spectrum of views to be acknowledged. By way of
distinctions, it is noted that classical dispensationalists accept
both [baptism](Baptism "Baptism") and the
[Lord's Supper](Lord's_Supper "Lord's Supper") as applicable to the
church. The Mid-Acts (Hypers) reject baptism and the Acts-28
(Ultras) reject both. Additionally, for the Hyper, the doctrine for
the church is contained solely in the Pauline epistles. For the
Ultra, doctrine for the *gentile* church is contained only in
Paul's post-Acts 28 (prison) epistles.

Norman Geisler uses the terms interchangeably in volume 4 of his
Systematic Theology.^[[3]](#note-2)^ On page 27, he refers to
Bullingerites as "extreme ultradispensationalists"; while Baker,
Stam and O'Hair are called "less-extreme ultradispensationalists".
On pages 680-681, under the section of Ultra-Dispensationalism, Dr.
Geisler again includes Baker in his description of
ultra-dispensationalists, while Bullinger is again called an
extreme ultradispensationalist. He states: "Ultradispensationalists
call themselves the grace movement... Compared to even more
moderate dispensationalists like John Walvoord (1910-2002) and
Charles Ryrie (b.1925), the grace movement is ultra- or
hyperdispensational."
