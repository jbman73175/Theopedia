**Hypnotism** has been defined as "a sleeplike state that
nevertheless permits a wide range of behavioral responses to
stimulation. The hypnotized individual appears to heed only the
communications of the hypnotist. Even memory and awareness of self
may be altered by suggestion and the effects of that suggestion may
be extended [hypnotically] into subsequent waking activity" [1],
[Josh McDowell](Josh_McDowell "Josh McDowell") in
*Understanding the Occult*.

Today, hypnosis is something that is accepted in the medical world
as a valuable aid to treatments especially in psychiatry and
psychotherapy. This has been a topic of serious discussions and
debate in medical, governmental as well as Christian circles as it
was perceived to have roots in occultism. But today its connection
with occultic practices is ruled out by the therapists and has been
accepted ‘as the function of nerve system and a legitimate
therapeutic tool’[2] . Despite these affirmations, there remains an
aura of mystery around the use of hypnotism in medicine as it
involves unknown areas of consciousness.

## Etymological description

Hypnosis comes from the Greek word *hypnos* (sleep). According to
Greek mythology, Hypnos was the god of sleep [3]. Hypnosis
therefore refers to a sleep-like state. Likewise, to hypnotize is
to induce an altered state of consciousness characterized by deep
relaxation and heightened suggestibility [4]. The term was
originally coined by James Braid in 1842 to describe a phenomenon
previously known as mesmerism. Hypnosis, hypnotic state, hypnotic
trance and hypnotism are often used interchangeably to refer to the
phenomenon of hypnotism [5].

## Background development

Hypnosis is nothing new. It has been used for thousands of years by
witchdoctors and shaman spirit mediums alike. But the development
of hypnosis as a field of study in the context of medicine and
psychology dates from the claims of **Fredrich Anton Mesmer** (1733
- 1815), a Austrian doctor who performed many therapeutic healings
induced by magnets. He is considered to be the Father of Hypnotism.
According to him,
*“Disease was the result of imbalance in the patient’s animal magnetism”*
[6]. Later the theories of Mesmer were discredited by French
Investigating Commission. His healings were attributed to the power
of suggestion. In spite of the serious flaws in the claims of
Mesmer, his theories and practices opened doors to further
examination of the nature and effect of hypnotism. By the turn of
the 20th century, there was slight stagnancy in the growth of
hypnotism. But after the world wars, this field was revived and
integrated inextricably into the field of medicine. In 1956, the
American Medical Association pronounced that Hypnosis was
*‘a valuable therapeutic adjunct’* [7]. Then other professional
associations also gave similar recognition to the validity of
hypnosis.

## Environment for hypnotism

In the process of hypnosis, the place that is used plays a major
role. David G. Berner lists the following things as necessity for
having the desired environment for hypnosis [8]:

-   The restriction of sensory input through the removal of
    distracting stimuli (A Quiet relaxing situation)
-   The narrowing of attention to an external object (May be a
    spot, a cross etc)
-   Talking in a quiet monotonous repetition (Which leads to deep
    hypnotic state)
-   Suggestion of internal images for increased sense of attention

## Myths about hypnotism

-   **Fear of Induction**: The process of induction or getting into
    a hypnotic state requires the consent of the subject in most cases.
    It is very clear that most of the time hypnotic treatments are done
    with voluntary acceptance [9]. But ‘you can never be hypnotized
    against your will’ is only a half truth. Though the personal
    cooperation of the individual is necessary, it is possible to
    hypnotize a person without his/her knowledge. It can be induced
    through the stimuli of the external objects and non-verbal behavior
    of the hypnotist. But state of trance can’t be maintained without
    the actual awareness of the person involved [10].

-   **Fear of Control By Hypnotist**: There is always a fear what
    one would do under the power of hypnosis. This fear is mostly
    caused by Medias and Fictions. Yet this is given ample attention.
    The nature of hypnosis is that those in trance may readily accept
    and respond to suggestions given uncritically. If improperly and
    unprofessionally employed, it is potentially dangerous. This point
    resulted in the moves of legislation in regard to the use of
    hypnosis. But extensive studies in the field say if the given
    suggestion contradicts the ethics of the person, he tends to avoid
    or get awake from the hypnotic state [11].

-   **Fear of Getting stuck**: There has been a fear expressed that
    one may get stuck in hypnotic state and not able to come back to
    alert stage. But till now no such cases are documented. The truth
    is one is capable of alerting in any moment. Failure will result
    either in spontaneous arousal or a conversion into natural sleep
    from which the person will get up later as usual [12].

## Uses of hypnotism

**An Aid in Treatment:** The most celebrated use of hypnosis is
that it remains as a treatment tool. When hypnosis is used for
treatment of psychiatric disorders, it is called hypnotherapy and
is quite useful in conditions like conversion Disorders,
Dissociative Disorders, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),
Anxiety Disorders and Eating Disorders. It is extensively used in
child psychiatry, Anxiety Syndromes and Trauma Related Disorders.
It is also used to discuss trauma memories and diffuse its impact.
Hypnosis is also useful in rehabilitation after accidents and
stroke, as well as with psychogenic symptoms. In diabetes, cancer,
heart disease, renal failure, orthopedics, the use of hypnotic
interventions has been associated with better symptom management.
Hypnosis is also being used to control gynecological pains. There
are case reports of delivering babies under hypnosis. Physicians
hypnotize [13]:

-   To induce analgesia (Decreased perception of pain) and
    anesthesia (absence of pain other sensation)
-   To allay apprehension and anxiety
-   To repress or suggest away symptoms
-   As an adjunctive technique in the treatment of psychiatric
    deceases.

**An Aid in Performance Improvement :** Some people, mostly
athletes look to hypnotism to improve physical, academic,
professional or artistic performance. But evidences shows that if
motivation is increased in other ways, the same person can exceed
in performance [14].

**An investigation Tool :** As a tool of Investigation, hypnosis
has serious limitation. Hypnotized objects may confess the crimes
they actually committed and the crimes they fantasy having
committed. So the usage of hypnosis cannot be conclusive as an
investigation tool [15].

**In Research** : Hypnosis has proper uses in psychological and
medical (including psychiatric) research [16].

## Evaluation from a Christian perspective

The **Secular Point of View** towards Hypnotism can be summarized
with this statement:
*“The value of hypnosis is that it provides a means of achieving a special state in which a person can go beyond the controls of usual rational thinking to affect both mental and physical process”*
[17]. Often it is referred as a potential resource of great
benefit. Some Christians also have positive attitude toward the
usage of hypnosis in the field medicine. Some well-known professing
Christians (e.g., the late Walter Martin of CRI, and Josh McDowell
& John Stewart in their book Understanding the Occult) allege that
hypnosis can be helpful if practiced by medical doctors whose
intent is good rather than
evil.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
Benner summarizing the **Liberal Christian View** says
“*Today hypnosis is understood as the function of nerve system. And scripture confirms that we are vulnerable to suggestion (Ex: Gen3, Eve was deceived by the suggestion of the evil one which caused the fall). God created us with the capacity to experience shift in the consciousness. The informed use of hypnosis can help the Christians expose and shed false and damaging beliefs in order to become more open and receptive to the true and redemptive word of God. When properly used as any other force of nature, hypnosis can be of great benefit and can help us become more like Christ*”
[18].

On the other hand, some **Conservative Christians** oppose the use
of Hypnotism in any form bluntly as occultic and demonic. Some of
the responses of conservatives are found below:

\1. Putting oneself in a hypnotic state is yielding oneself to a
 vulnerable position. Four ways to get in touch with the spiritual
 realm quickly is by hypnosis, drugs, meditation, and visualization
 (hallucinations). Anytime we interfere and change the normal brain
 pattern we bring ourselves into an altered state of consciousness,
 and if radical enough in touch with the spiritual realm. The fact
 is no one knows exactly how hypnosis actually “works,” and though
 they may have intentions of using it for good, it is still an
 unexplored area that affects the mind.

\2. Just because hypnotists use scientific terminology does not
 mean their abilities are mental or from natural phenomena. Most
 hypnotists do not believe in the occult and are neither open to
 considering this phenomena being from a spiritual (demonic) source.
 As one surrenders himself to a doorway into the occult under the
 disguise of “science” or “medicine”, he opens himself to the powers
 outside himself, and to probable deception.

\3. We are warned by God not to practice sorcery, divination, or
 enchantment. We are not to follow after mediums, wizards,
 enchanters, charmers, and those who have a familiar spirit (Deut.
 18:9-14). Hypnosis, as it is practiced today, may be related to
 what is identified in the Old Testament as “enchantment” (Lev.
 19:26). Christian Hypnosis Counseling services sounds good on the
 surface by promising to help you lose weight, quit smoking, release
 your stress, etc. Yet we can't Christianize what God has
 forbidden.

Today the Seventh Day Adventist church, excepting some individuals
in various churches, is the only Christian denomination that does
not have any support of hypnosis. In recent years, the Seventh-Day
Adventists have lessened their resistance by using relaxation and
suggestion therapy. Christian Science also does not support
hypnosis. The Catholic church does not have a problem with
hypnotherapy and the Pope has issued statements that it's
okay.^[***[citations\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

  
Occult experts Wilson & Weldon write in their book,
**Occult Shock**, the reasons for distrusting, the use of hypnosis
involve [19]:

\1. Its possible similarity to the forbidden Biblical practice of
 charming.

\2. Its historic origin to the occult in both the East (yoga) and
 West (Spiritist Movement).

\3. The fact that a wide variety of occult powers can be developed
 from hypnosis.

\4. Often past lives “popup” during standard hypnotic regression,
 even when there is no expectation or searching for them.

\5. Cases of possession that have resulted.

\6. The will must be surrendered to another person

\7. A similarity to mediumistic trance states

A conservative response towards hypnotism can be summarized as
follows:
*“As far as being a Christian and becoming involved in this practice, it is to be avoided at all costs; your spiritual welfare may be at stake. This is just like 'charming' forbidden in Deut.18:10-12. If you traffic in the occult you may soon pay the consequences of overstepping the boundary God has clearly made. It has the potential to open an individual to spiritual experiences and spirit oppression”*
[20].

## Conclusion

Whether you are a rigid conservative or outright liberal doesn’t
matter as we deal with the questions pertinent to hypnotism. It
obviously carries some element of mystery as none is actually sure
of ‘how it works’ and there may be many obvious hidden dangers
lurking in the darkness to victimize the innocent participants as
people defenselessly expose themselves to the world beyond their
control. None knows when the line will be crossed and led into the
danger zone. Extra care must be exercised with the use of hypnosis.
If there is any compelling necessity to undergo a hypnotic
treatment also, it would be better to figure out other options and
solutions instead of taking a chance with our highly vulnerable
spiritual well-being.
