## History

by Dr. Wright Van Plew

Having done everything to stand firm, stand firm therefore
Ephesians 6:13-14

### A time to stand firm in history

The philosophy known as Rationalism swept across Europe leading to
the 19th Century theological expressions of Modernism and Higher
Criticism. These anti-supernatural concepts crossed the Atlantic by
European trained Americans. Bible believing Christians saw the
storm clouds gathering.

As 1900 approached, national/interdenominational Bible Conferences
were loosely organized. They provided an ongoing platform for
preachers to respond to the unbiblical teaching that was spreading
among denominational leaders, seminary professors, and pastors.
Then from 1910-1915, a twelve-volume doctrinal response to
Modernism sequentially came off the presses. Entitled The
Fundamentals, these twelve paperbacks ultimately contained ninety
articles written by sixty-four authors from every denomination.
Financed by the wealthy president of Union Oil Company, The
Fundamentals were distributed free of charge to over 300,000
Protestant ministers, teachers, missionaries, theological
professors, and Christian workers.

There were several results. First, orthodox theology was presented
and defended. Second, apostasy was exposed. Third, Bible-believing
Christians were galvanized into a more cohesive force. And fourth,
those who opposed "Modernists Christians" were given a new name as
Bible-believersÂ : "Fundamentalists."

The "Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy" by the 1920s caused many
congregations to withdraw from their parent denominations.
Departure from their historic doctrines by the leadership and
involvement in movements contrary to faith gave the churches reason
to "come out from among them and be separate," (2 Cor. 6:17). They
did this at great cost, losing many benefits of association and
often valuable properties such as church buildings, parsonages, and
pensions. But they were "set for the defense of the Gospel," and
committed to an uncompromising stand for the truth of God's word.
New churches were formed with these principles.

The Scriptural need for inter-church fellowship, counsel and
cooperation was recognized at the start by these new churches. The
American Conference of Undenominational Churches was formed for
this purpose in 1923. During its 1930 Annual Convention at the
Cicero (IL) Bible Church, the name was changed to The Independent
Fundamental Churches of America in a motion offered by Dr. J.
Oliver Buswell, president of Wheaton College. By this time a new
Constitution and a more comprehensive doctrinal statement had been
prepared and were adopted unanimously. The former magazine, The
Pioneer of a New Era was renamed VOICE - An Independent Church
Journal.



### A time to stand firm on foundations

"Has the time come for Fundamentalists to promptly and literally
obey the emphatic commandment given to believers in II Cor.
6:14-18; Eph. 5:11 and II John 9-11?" This question was asked in
the Moody Monthly for February, 1930. The inception of the IFCA
four months later was an affirmative answer and by 1940, there were
665 members of IFCA and by 1950, there were 1,067 members. (This
question in Moody Monthly also led BIOLA University historian, Dr.
J. O. Henry to title his 1983 History of the IFCA, For Such a Time
as This. )

The new name, IFCA International, adopted in 1996, reflects the
world-wide missionary vision and the increasing number of
individual members serving in foreign lands. But it also contains
the historical significance of the original name. "F" (Fundamental)
indicates that the movement stands firmly upon "the foundation of
the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the chief
corner stone" (Eph. 2:20). "I" (Independent) and "C" (Churches)
speak of the nature of the fellowship not being a "church" as a
denomination, but comprising individual bodies of believers
controlled by the Head of the church through the Holy Spirit. The
Articles of Faith and Doctrine are essentially the same as at the
beginning. The only changes are to strengthen or clarify them. They
include the cardinal beliefs of the historic biblical Christian
faith and those Scriptural principles necessary to jointly
participate in the Lord's work. It is outstanding among such
statements of various Christian organizations, providing a sure
foundation for this fellowship of biblical churches and
ministries.

### A time to stand firm on occupations

Jesus said, "Occupy [do business (NKJV)] till I come." (Luke
19:13). The primary occupation of the independent local church is
to proclaim the Gospel and to foster Scriptural Christian living.
But this applies to world-wide outreach as well to the home field.

The early churches set the example by being interdependent as well
as independent. They circulated the Scriptures and extended
assistance to one another in times of need. IFCA International
provides for such activity. There are many national benefits of
interdependence as seen throughout the pages of this issue of the
Voice.

But if IFCA International was to continue its growth, it had to do
more than recruit new members from apostate denominations. It had
to begin new churches by church extension. The development of a
church extension program without centrally controlling local
churches was discussed for many years in National and Regional
circles.

By 1956 the policy was adopted for Church Extension missions to be
organized independently to serve Regional areas and become members
of the movement as do churches. This brings the church planting
effort near to its supporters with better oversight and assistance
for developing congregations. In the past eleven years, 17 such
missions have completed over 100 new churches plus an average of 40
per year in the process of organization. In the same period, over
5000 professions of faith were recorded. Greater missionary support
of these ministries is needed. It is the primary means of growth in
the movement.

### A time to stand firm with vision

"Our Vision for the 21st Century" was adopted at the 1995 Annual
Convention in Colorado Springs, Co. In it, this movement is
committed to a mission and vision for this new century as well as
excellence in the pursuit of 17 specific goals "dedicated to the
ongoing cultivation of a balanced, growing fellowship."

But we today must not forget the men of vision in the first seven
decades of IFCA International. They founded the IFCA and set it on
its course to face their challenges of the 20th Century. Some of
