Speaking of himself, he writes:

"My main interests in research have been Luke-Acts, the Pastoral
Epistles, and aspects of New Testament theology. These have 8ed to
the publication of commentaries on the Greek text of Luke and the
Pastoral Epistles. I have been particularly concerned with the work
of Luke as both historian and theologian; this led to my sharing in
the editing of a collection of essays on the theology of Acts."

"More recently I have written part of the second volume of a New
Testament introduction for students and edited a revision and
updating of Moulton and Geden's Concordance to the Greek New
Testament so that it can be used with the current major editions of
the Greek New Testament as well as with older editions."

"In process of publication are a theology of the New Testament
aimed primarily at the student market and a section on Acts in a
one-volume commentary on the use of the Old Testament in the New
Testament. A short book on the problem of how we get from the Bible
to a contemporary theology is due to appear soon. My current
project is to collaborate with Stephen N. Williams in a theological
commentary on Romans for the Two Horizons series."

"I have taught modules recently at Bibelschule Wiedenest;
International Baptist Theological Seminary, Prague; the Evangelical
Theological Seminary in Cairo; Donetsk Christian University,
Ukraine
