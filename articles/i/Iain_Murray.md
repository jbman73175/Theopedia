Iain Murray
**Iain H. Murray**, born in Lancashire, England in 1931 is a
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") theological historian and
co-founder of Banner of Truth Trust, which reprints many classic
Christian materials. Murray has deep respect for the Puritans and
seeks to distinguish true revival from the
[charismatic](Charismatic "Charismatic"), emotional, and pragmatic
views prevalent today. He is also a modern proponent of
[postmillennialism](Postmillennialism "Postmillennialism").

"Murray was educated in the Isle of Man and at the
[University of Durham](University_of_Durham "University of Durham")
and entered the Christian ministry in 1955. He served as assistant
to Dr [Martyn Lloyd-Jones](Martyn_Lloyd-Jones "Martyn Lloyd-Jones")
at Westminster Chapel (1956-59) and subsequently at Grove Chapel,
London (1961-69), and St Giles Presbyterian Church, Sydney
(1981-84). Although remaining a minister of the Presbyterian Church
of Australia, he currently lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, where the
Banner of Truth Trust (of which he is founding trustee) has its
main office. Iain is married to Jean and has five children and ten
grandchildren."
