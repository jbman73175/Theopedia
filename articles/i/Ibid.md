**Ibid** means "in the same source" and is used to save space by
referencing the previous work in a end or footnote. For example:

1.  J.I. Packer, *Knowing God* (IVP, 1993), p. 25.
2.  Ibid., p. 37.
3.  Ibid.

In footnote 2, the "ibid" stands in place of rewriting the author
and work, yet a new page number can be cited. In footnote 3, ibid
*alone* implies the same author, work, *and* page number from the
previous reference (fn. 2).
