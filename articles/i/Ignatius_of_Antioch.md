Ignatius of Antioch
**Ignatius of Antioch** (ca. 50 - 110) was the third bishop of
Antioch, after [Peter](Peter "Peter") and Euodius, whom Ignatius
succeeded around AD 68. Ignatius, who also called himself
Theophorus, was most likely a disciple of both Apostles Peter and
[John](John "John"). Several of his letters have survived to this
day and he is generally considered to be one of the
[Apostolic Fathers](Apostolic_Fathers "Apostolic Fathers") (the
earliest group of the
[Church Fathers](Church_Fathers "Church Fathers")), and a saint by
both the [Catholic](Catholic "Catholic"), who celebrate his feast
day on February 1, and the
[Orthodox churches](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy"), who
celebrate his feast day on October 17.

Ignatius was arrested by the Roman authorities and transported to
Rome to die in the arena. They hoped to make an example of him and
thus discourage Christianity from spreading. Instead, he met with
and encouraged Christians all along his route, and wrote letters to
the Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Philadelphians, Smyrneans,
and Romans, as well as a letter to [Polycarp](Polycarp "Polycarp"),
who according to Christian tradition was Bishop of Smyrna and a
disciple of the Apostle John.

These letters proved to be influential in the development of
Christian theology, since the number of extant writings from this
period of church history is very small. They bear signs of being
written in great haste and without a proper plan, such as run-on
sentences and an unsystematic succesion of thought. Ignatius is the
first known Christian writer to put great stress on loyality to a
single bishop in each city, who is assisted by both presbyters
(priests) and deacons. Earlier writings only mention either bishops
or presbyters, and give the impression that there was usually more
than one bishop per congregation. Ignatius also stresses the value
of the [Eucharist](Eucharist "Eucharist"), calling it "a medicine
to immortality". The very strong desire for bloody martyrdom in the
arena, which Ignatius expresses rather graphically in places, seems
quite odd to the modern reader.
