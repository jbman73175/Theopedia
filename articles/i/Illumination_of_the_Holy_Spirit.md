The **illumination of the Holy Spirit** is "[t]he process by which
God's Holy Spirit enables us to understand His word and apply it to
our lives."
[[1]](http://monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/topic/glossaries.html)

"The Reformers, and particularly
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"), stressed the way the
objective, written Word and the inner, supernatural ministry of the
Holy Spirit work together, the Holy Spirit illuminating the Word to
God's people. The Word without the illumination of the Holy Spirit
remains a closed book." - James M Boice

It is "not a giving of new revelation, but a work within us that
enables us to grasp and to love the revelation that is there before
us in the biblical text as heard and read, and as explained by
teachers and writers."^[[1]](#note-0)^

The necessity of the illumination of the Holy Spirit does not
negate the doctrine of the
[clarity of Scripture](Clarity_of_Scripture "Clarity of Scripture").

## Key passages

### 1 Corinthians 2:12-14

*"Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned."*

### 1 John 2:20, 27

*"But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all have knowledge... But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie—just as it has taught you, abide in him."*

### Psalm 119:18

*"Open my eyes, that I may behold Wonderful things from Your law."*

-   [The Holy Spirit's Role in Biblical Interpretation](http://www.fuller.edu/ministry/berean/hs_role.htm),
    by Daniel P. Fuller - "This refusal to welcome the teachings of the
    Bible hardly excludes, however, the natural man's having a
    *cognition* of what he repudiates. To the contrary, the fact that
    he experiences a revulsion against a biblical teaching presupposes
    a prior cognition of that teaching, for how can a man hate
    something without having some knowledge of it? ... Even though the
    teachings of the Bible are manifestly reasonable, our reasoning
    powers are not sufficient to suppress the awesome power of sin
    which predisposes us to glory in ourselves. Only God, through the
    Holy Spirit, overcomes this power of sin, so that we are willing to
    love from the heart what our minds can tell us is reasonable."

### Critical

-   [The Holy Spirit “Illumination” Theory: A Critical Review](http://www.christiancourier.com/feature/2003_05.htm),
    by Wayne Jackson - "The doctrine of special illumination
    contradicts the clear testimony of Scripture, namely the explicit
    affirmation that the devout student is able to understand the Word
    of God as given originally."
