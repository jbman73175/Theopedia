## Biblical narrative

Although the concept of the image of God is not treated at much
length in the pages of Scripture, its chief appearance is in the
New Testament, where an apparent problem has been solved. We shall
look at some of the Scriptural evidence regarding this theme in
order to see what we can say about the initial state, the problem,
and its solution.

### Image created

> Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.
> And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the
> birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth
> and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." So God
> created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him;
> male and female he created them.  
> Gen. 1:26–27

The opening chapter of [Genesis](Genesis "Genesis") records for us
that God created [humanity](Humanity "Humanity") "in the image of
God". For centuries, [theologians](Theologian "Theologian") have
debated precisely what it means to be "the image of God"; the
majority interpretation has been in terms of *spirituality*,
although other proposals have included *dominion* (intertestamental
[Judaism](Judaism "Judaism")), *original righteousness*
([Luther](Luther "Luther")) and even *sexuality*
([Barth](Barth "Barth"))!^[[1]](#note-0)^ However we interpret the
idea of man's being in the image of God, it brings with it certain
other facts, which may help to illumine what this idea means.

We are the image of God, and therefore **we are to remain humble**.
No less of an issue in our modern day than in the author's, man has
always desired to attain deity, seeking to declare himself more
than he is. The Pharaohs of Egypt declared themselves the sons of
the gods, and modern society can sound like the pagans of old,
telling us to search for the god inside ourselves. But from the
beginning, Genesis reminds us that we are created, and we are
created as images. An image is never the same as the reality, and
we are only the image because God is the ultimate reality.

We are the image of God, and therefore
**rule as his appointed representatives**. The command to have
dominion over creation and to subdue it is an explicitly-stated
consequence of our role as the image of God. God, as Creator, is
the Sovereign Lord of creation, and we, as his image, are his
viceroys. And yet we are to rule as God himself would rule. There
is no room here for a tyrannical ruling of creation; if the God who
made us his viceroys is the God of all grace and compassion, then
our rule over nature should reflect his rule.

We are the image of God, and therefore
**human beings are worthy of respect**. We shall explore the
development of this theme a little further later on, but it is the
case that the creation story leaves us in no doubt: every human
being is created in the image of God, without exception or
distinction.

We are the image of God, and therefore
**murder is unconscionably evil**. To destroy plant life would be
wanton and careless, to destroy animal life, cruel. But to destroy
the life of another human being is to destroy an image-bearer of
God, an offence against the one whose image is borne. It is for
this reason that the penalty for murder is given as death in Gen.
9:6.

We are the image of God, and therefore
**to make another image is wrong**. The
[Decalogue](Decalogue "Decalogue")'s injunction against idolatry is
understood by some
theologians^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
as being based on the fact that there is already an image of God on
the earth: humanity. It is sin to attempt to replacethat which God
has created and called "very good" with our own efforts.

### Image cracked

> To the woman he said, "I will surely multiply your pain in
> childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire
> shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you."  
> And to Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of
> your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, 'You
> shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in pain
> you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles
> it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the
> field. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you
> return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are
> dust, and to dust you shall return."  
> Gen. 3:16–19
>

The image of God did not, however, last long. In
[Eden](Garden_of_Eden "Garden of Eden"), [Adam](Adam "Adam") and
[Eve](Eve "Eve") disobeyed God's command and ate from the tree of
the knowledge of good and evil. The consequences of this sin on
mankind are spelt out in Genesis 3:16–19. A brief summary is
presented here below. These consequences tell us, without using the
language explicitly, that the image of God had been broken.

The man and the woman were **guilty before God**. No longer could
they claim to be in right standing before God; instead, their
righteousness was exchanged for sinfulness, and their glory, for
shame.

The man and the woman experience **broken relationships**. Already
we see this as Adam and Eve engage in recrimination and
blame-shifting, but as if to make the point more forcefully, the
LORD God tells Eve that "[her] desire will be for [her] husband,
and he will rule over [her]." Strife and bitterness replace the
peace and harmony of the garden.

The man and the woman will experience **pain**. Eve's pain was to
be in childbirth, while Adam's will be in toil all the days of his
life. Eve's pain may be worse in intensity, but Adam's is worse in
duration.

The man and the woman are **cast out of the presence of God**. They
are sent away from the garden, the place where God resides, and God
places *cherubim* across the entrance to guard the way back in.

The man and the woman **lose their mastery over nature**. To Adam,
God says that the ground will bring forth thorns and thistles, and
only by painful toil will he be able to eat food.

The man and the woman experience **death**. The curse of which they
were warned is left to the end, as Adam is told that he and Eve
shall "return to the ground, for out of it [they] were taken". Not
only, however, is the death of the body in view here, but rather
the death of the whole person. Body and soul, together with
relationships and vocation, all of these die. Genesis 3 ends in
despair, as the man and the woman are barred from access to the
tree of life to experience what Paul describes as "this body of
death".

However, all is not lost. We already know that God continues to
deal with humanity on the basis of his image (Gen. 9:6), even if
that image is now, in the words of Blocher, more like a
caricature^[[2]](#note-1)^. Within Genesis 3 itself, we see the
first glimmerings of hope, with the promise of the seed who will
crush the serpent's head, and the mercy of God in providing a
covering to our naked, ashamed first parents. It is to the promise
and provision that we now turn.

### Image conformed

> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all
> creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on
> earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or
> rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for
> him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold
> together. And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the
> beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might
> be preeminent. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to

> on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.  
> Col. 1:15–20
> 
> {{\#if:|

There is, however, a perfect image of God. Jesus Christ, who
himself said, "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father" (John 14:9)
is the image of the invisible God, "the radiance of the glory of
God and the exact imprint of his nature" (Heb. 1:3). In his life,
he shows the Father perfectly, and by his death, holds out God
himself to needy sinners. Indeed, it is in his death that we are
told "his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance" (Is.
52:14), and by his death—and resurrection—that we ourselves are
raised as restored images and as sons of God. We see, then, that it
is by his degradation beyond human likeness that we are elevated to
the image of God; in fact, we are elevated beyond simply what Adam
lost, as we shall be made like Jesus in his resurrection body, who
is more glorious than Adam ever was.

This image is also that to which we are being conformed (Rom. 8:29,
2 Cor. 3:18), being prepared for the day of the Lord's appearing,
when the sons of God shall be revealed (Rom. 8:19) and we shall be
made like him (1 John 3:2). In that day, the curse of Eden will be
totally broken, and humanity's full restoration as the image of God
will be complete. In this way, harmony with God, man and creation
are the certain hope of the Lord's redeemed, and are such on the
basis of the Lord himself, who is the perfect image of God.

The story of the image of God, then, is one of creation, loss and
what we may term the greater-than-restoration. That final chapter,
the greater-than-restoration, takes place during our lives as we
live and grow in the Lord, and will, one glorious day, be
completed, when he returns to live on a new earth, under a new
heaven, with a new humanity imaging the eternal God.

## Related quotes

-   “Talking about a ‘picture of God,’ for example, strikes us as
    naïve or blasphemous, while the notion of an ‘image of God,’ though
    it may be controversial, is taken seriously. The key lies in the
    use or function: a picture reproduces; an image exemplifies. An
    image is a picture in which nonessential features have been
    suppressed and essential ones highlighted. A picture, we might say,
    represents features indiscriminately; an image, by contrast,
    represents selectively. An image is both more and less than a
    picture: more insofar as it makes a claim about what is definitive
    or essential to the object; less insofar as it may be less complete
    or ‘literal.’ A picture shows us something; an image seeks to show
    us what that something really is.” (Garrett Green,
    *Imagining God: Theology and the Religious Imagination* [Grand
    Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1998], 93-94)
