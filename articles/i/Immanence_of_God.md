The literal meaning of the **immanence of God** is "to be within"
or "near" in relation to [God's](God "God") creation. Immanence is
closely related to God's
[omnipresence](Omnipresence_of_God "Omnipresence of God"), in that
God is always present within the universe, though distinct from it.
God is 'within' the universe in that God is its sustaining cause.
