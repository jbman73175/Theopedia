Kant moved beyond both
[empiricism](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism "wikipedia:Empiricism")
and
[rationalism](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism "wikipedia:Rationalism")
by expounding a
[Transcendental philosophy](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/transcendental_philosophy "wikipedia:transcendental philosophy").

do we know?" and "What do we know?", transcendental philosophy
asks, "What are the grounds and conditions for the very possibility
of knowledge?"

[philosophy of religion](Philosophy_of_religion "Philosophy of religion")

interpret that experience?"^[[1]](#note-0)^
