Preachers and theologians from various Protestant traditions have
used the term "**imparted righteousness**" to identify the
*righteous principle* imparted by God to believers when He
regenerates them. Believers thereby become "partakers of the divine
nature" (cf. 2 Peter 1:4). It is this principle of righteousness
imparted to men in regeneration which is ever in conflict with the
old Adamic nature.

It is critical, however, to maintain the distinction between the
"imputed righteousness" of Christ which is the basis for
[justification](Justification "Justification") and this "imparted
righteousness" which may be seen as the basis for subsequent
[sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification").

While this doctrine is rooted in Scripture, it is somewhat
problematic to call it "imparted righteousness," for that which is
imparted is a righteous *principle* into man's nature, not
*righteousness* per se. Care must be taken in using the term
*imparted* righteousness because it is sometimes confused with and
sometimes intentionally used to refer to the Roman Catholic
doctrine of
[infused righteousness](Infused_righteousness "Infused righteousness"),
which in Catholicism is the basis for justification.

Wesleyans and
[Seventh Day Adventists](Seventh_Day_Adventism "Seventh Day Adventism")
have used the term in ways which seem to make it part of the basis
for final justification.
