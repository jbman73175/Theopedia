Classic [theism](Theism "Theism") teaches that God is
**impassible** — not subject to suffering, pain, or the ebb and
flow of involuntary passions. In the words of the Westminster
Confession of Faith, God is "without body, parts, or passions,
immutable." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Various views

It is important to note that the debate regarding the doctrine of
impassibility does not center on whether God has feelings or
emotions. Though some would argue for the position that God does
not possess any feelings or passions, those such as Paul Helm who
seek to preserve impassibility do not view God as completely
apathetic. Rather, the question is whether or not God's passions
are voluntary or involuntary. Does God actually *react* to his
creation in an emotional way? Can humanity hurt God, emotionally?

The standard difficulty encountered by advocates of impassibility
is that the Scripture narrative presents a God who does, in fact,
react to his creation. The typical rejoinder to this is that the
narrative portions of the Holy Text also present God with certain
human features such as hands, eyes, etc. Surely, it is claimed, we
do not accept all descriptions of God in human terms
(anthropomorphisms), and as such we should be cautious in accepting
the emotions and passions of God at face value.

In recent years many in the Open Theist circles have explored the
various anthropomorphisms of God to discover if, in fact, they do
reveal something about God, however imperfect the description may
be.
