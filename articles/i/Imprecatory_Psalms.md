**Imprecatory psalms** are those those psalms that contain curses
or prayers for the punishment of the psalmist's enemies. To
imprecate means to invoke evil upon, or curse. Psalms 7, 35, 55,
58, 59, 69, 79, 109, 137 and 139 all contain prayers for God's
judgment on the psalmist's enemies. Example imprecatory statements
from the Psalms follow:

-   Psalm 55:15 - Let death take my enemies by surprise; let them
    go down alive to the grave.
-   Psalm 58:6 - O God, break the teeth in their mouths.
-   Psalm 69:28 - May they be blotted out of the book of life and
    not be listed with the righteous.
-   Psalm 109:9 - May his children be fatherless and his wife a
    widow.
-   Psalm 137:9 - How blessed will be the one who seizes your
    infants and dashes them against the rocks.

## Imprecatory Psalms and Christian ethics

Various difficulties arise as attempts are made to harmonize the
imprecatory attitude of the psalms with [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")’
teaching that one should love our enemies (Matthew 5:44). Several
explanations have been proposed:

### A reflection of godly thinking

"There is a kind of hate for the sinner (viewed as morally corrupt
and hostile to [God](God "God")) that may coexist with pity and
even a desire for their salvation... [T]hat there comes a point of
such extended, hardened, high-handed lovelessness toward God that
it may be appropriate to call down anathema on it."
^[[1]](#note-0)^

"...it is appropriate that we pray that Christ would vindicate his
holy name and program by destroying the enemies of righteousness,
just as he preserves those who love his name." ^[[2]](#note-1)^

### Not a matter of personal revenge

The imprecatory Psalms are not a matter of personal revenge;
rather, these “harsh” statements reflect the Psalmist's (David’s)
awareness of God’s justice and his intolerance for sin.
[Walter Kaiser](Walter_Kaiser "Walter Kaiser") has observed:

“They [these hard sayings] are not statements of personal vendetta,
but they are utterances of zeal for the kingdom of God and his
glory. To be sure, the attacks which provoked these prayers were
not from personal enemies; rather, they were rightfully seen as
attacks against God and especially his representatives in the
promised line of the Messiah.”^[[3]](#note-2)^

### Explanations of what would happen

"...they merely were stating what would happen to the wicked; they
were not actually asking God to destroy the wicked."
^[[4]](#note-3)^

### Application

Some hold that Jesus introduced a "new" law appropriate for this
dispensation.
^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
This view sees the NT admonition to love our enemies and pray for
the welfare of our persecutors (Matthew 5:44) as incompatible with
imprecatory Psalms of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament"). This perspective is
typified in the following quote:

"... whilst we need not suppose that the indignation which burns so
hotly is other than a righteous indignation, yet that we are to
regard it as permitted under the Old Testament rather than
justifiable under the [New](New_Testament "New Testament"). Surely
there is nothing in such an explanation which in the smallest
degree impugns the Divine authority of the earlier Scriptures. In
how many respects have the harsher outlines of the legal economy
been softened down by 'the mind that was in Christ Jesus.' ... As
in the
[Sermon on the Mount](Sermon_on_the_Mount "Sermon on the Mount") He
substitutes the moral principle for the legal enactment, so here He
substitutes the spirit of gentleness, meekness, endurance of
wrongs, for the spirit of fiery though righteous indignation. The
Old Testament is not contrary to the New, but it is inferior to
it.” ^[[5]](#note-4)^
However this view ignores the many imprecations in the New
Testament:

-   Matthew 23:13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
    hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for
    ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are
    entering to go in.
-   Matthew 26:23-24 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his
    hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. 24 The Son of
    man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom
    the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had
    not been born.
-   1 Corinthians 16:22 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ,
    let him be Anathema Maranatha.
-   Galatians 1:8-9 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach
    any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto
    you, let him be accursed. 9 As we said before, so say I now again,
    If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have
    received, let him be accursed.
-   Galatians 5:12 I would they were even cut off which trouble
    you.
-   2 Timothy 4:14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the
    Lord reward him according to his works:
-   Revelation 6:10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How
    long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our
    blood on them that dwell on the earth?
