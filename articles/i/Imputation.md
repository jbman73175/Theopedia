**Imputation** is "a transfer of benefit or harm from one
individual to another. In theology imputation may be used
negatively to refer to the transfer of the sin and guilt of Adam to
the rest of humankind. Positively, imputation refers to the
righteousness of Christ being transfered to those who believe on
him for salvation." -*Pocket Dictionary of Theological Terms*

Definition: Imputation "is used to designate any action or word or
thing as *reckoned* to a person. Thus in doctrinal language (1) the
sin of Adam is imputed to all his descendants, i.e., it is reckoned
as theirs, and they are dealt with therefore as guilty; (2) the
righteousness of Christ is imputed to them that believe in him, or
so attributed to them as to be considered their own; and (3) our
sins are imputed to Christ, i.e., he assumed our 'law-place,'
undertook to answer the demands of justice for our sins. In all
these cases the nature of imputation is the same (Rom. 5:12-19;
comp. Philemon 1:18, 19)." - *Easton Bible Dictionary*

To *impute* means to credit or reckon or count something to one's
account. It is distinct from impartation and infusion. The Greek
verb for imputation, *logizomai*
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#3049](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=3049&version=nas)]*^)
is used more than 40 times in the New Testament, ten times in
Romans chapter 4—sometimes called the imputation chapter. In the
[King James](King_James_Version "King James Version"), *logizomai*
is translated 'counted' in Rom 4:3, 5 'reckoned' in Rom 4:4, 10,
and 'imputed' in Rom 4:6, 8, 11, 22, 23, 24.
