The whole world was imputed with Adam's sin and condemned to die.
Paul argues this in [Romans 5](Romans_5 "Romans 5") by
demonstrating that people died from "[Adam](Adam "Adam") to
[Moses](Moses "Moses"), even over those whose sinning was not like
the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to
come" (v. 14, [ESV](ESV "ESV")). They died, even though they lived
before
[the law](index.php?title=Mosaic_Law&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mosaic Law (page does not exist)")
was given, and even though "sin is not counted where there is no
law" (v. 13, [ESV](ESV "ESV")). In other words, they were condemned
and died on the basis of one sin committed by one human being,
Adam. Understanding the imputation of Adam's sin is particularly
helpful when one realizes that Paul compares it with the imputation
of Christ's "one act of righteousness" (v. 18), in order to advance
the argument that "as one trespass led to condemnation for all men,
so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all
men" (v. 18).

The imputation of Adam's sin is distinct from
[original sin](Original_sin "Original sin"), the doctrine that
humans are born *with a sinful nature* as a result of Adam's sin.

## Was Adam's sin imputed to Christ?

Adam's sin was not imputed to Christ (nor was Christ born with a
sinful nature) because Jesus was born of the virgin Mary. The
imputation of sin takes place through the federal head.
