**Imputed righteousness** is a theological concept directly related
to the doctrine of [Justification](Justification "Justification").
It is particularly prevalent in the Reformed tradition.

"Justification is that step in salvation in which God declares the
believer righteous. Protestant theology has emphasized that this
includes the imputation of Christ's righteousness (crediting it to
the believer's "account"), whereas Roman Catholic theology
emphasizes that God justifies in accord with an
[infused righteousness](Infused_righteousness "Infused righteousness")
merited by Christ and maintained by the believer's good works,"
(Elwell Evangelical Dictionary).
Imputed righteousness therefore means that upon repentance and
belief in Christ, individuals are forensically declared righteous.
This righteousness is not the believer's own, rather it is Christ's
own righteousness 'imputed' to the believer.

A primary line of argumentation for this doctrine maintains that
perfect righteousness or holiness is necessary to be with God. All
mankind "fall short of the glory of God" (Rom 3:23) because all
their 'righteousness' is like filthy rags (Is 64:6) before the
throne of God, and so all are "dead in their trespasses and sins"
(Eph 2:1), and as a result "will not come into [God's] light for
fear that their evil deeds will be revealed" (John 3:20). All
mankind is in this predicament because all are the offspring of
Adam and Eve (Rom 5) who originally sinned against God. As a result
of Adam's fall, the world was cursed and sin entered the world. But
upon confession of one's own sin and faith in Christ's death and
resurrection, the sinner is
[justified](Justification "Justification") and counted as having
the righteousness of Christ.

Although all of Christianity would agree that Christ is the
believer's chief representative and head before the perfect
holiness of God, not all would agree that Christ's righteousness is
imputed to the believer. In some circles, imputed righteousness is
referred to as positive imputation - where the believer receives
the righteousness of Christ. It stands in contrast to negative
imputation - where the sin and judgment due to the repenting sinner
is imputed to Christ. Virtually all would agree with the latter,
but not all will agree with the former. The debate turns on a
number of Bible verses not the least of which deal with what and
whose righteousness was credited to Abraham when he believed God
(Genesis 15:5-6).

Imputed righteousness is one of the classic doctrines of
[Protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism") and traces back
through the Reformers - chiefly
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") and
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"). These men stood
against the Roman Catholic doctrine of *infused righteousness*
where the righteousness of the saints and of Christ is gradually
infused to the believer through the sacraments. For the Catholic,
infused righteousness either gradually dissipates as the believer
takes part in worldly sins or is enhanced by good works. If the
believer dies without having the fullness of righteousness, coming
in part from the
[last rites](index.php?title=Last_rites&action=edit&redlink=1 "Last rites (page does not exist)"),
he or she will temporarily spend time in
[purgatory](Purgatory "Purgatory") until the sinful status is
purged from his or her record.
