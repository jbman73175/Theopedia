**Inaugurated eschatology** is a term used to describe the belief
that the end times (or latter days) were inaugurated at the
[life](Life_of_Jesus "Life of Jesus"),
[death](index.php?title=Death_of_Jesus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Death of Jesus (page does not exist)")
and
[resurrection of Jesus](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus").
In other words, Jesus' bringing of the
[Kingdom of God](Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God") has both a
present and future aspects. Sometimes called
**already and not yet**, it argues that the end is already here,
but it has yet to be consummated. For example, Christians await the
final resurrection where they will receive new bodies, yet in a
sense, believers are already "raised with Christ" (Col. 3:1). Or,
as believers await the final judgment, in a sense they have already
passed through it, for "there is now no condemnation for those who
are in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:1) for believers that are
[justified by faith](Justification "Justification") in Christ (cf.
Rom. 3:21-36). Overall, there is a tension between this age and the
age to come.
