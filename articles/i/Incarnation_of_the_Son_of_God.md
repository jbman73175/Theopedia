The **Incarnation of the Son of God** is the terminology used to
describe what happened when the second person of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"), the eternal Son of God, "became
flesh" as he was miraculously conceived in the womb of the Virgin
Mary according to the Bible. In the incarnation, the divine nature
of the Son was perfectly united with human nature in one divine
Person. This person, [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"),
was both "truly God and truly man."

## Importance of the doctrine

In the early Christian era many divisions broke out concerning the
true nature of Christ. Christians believed that He was the Son of
God, but how was he both Son of God and truly man?

These disputes gave birth to certain [heresies](Heresy "Heresy"),
the most serious of which were the
[Gnostic](Gnosticism "Gnosticism") heresy, which stated that Jesus
only appeared to be a true man; the
[Arian heresy](Arianism "Arianism"), which taught that Jesus was a
created being, less than God; and the
[Nestorian heresy](Nestorianism "Nestorianism"), which implied that
the [Son of God](Son_of_God "Son of God"), and the man, Jesus,
shared the same body but retained two separate personhoods.

The final definitions of the incarnation and the nature of Jesus
were made by the early church at the
[Council of Ephesus](Council_of_Ephesus "Council of Ephesus") (431)
and the
[Council of Chalcedon](Council_of_Chalcedon "Council of Chalcedon")
(451). These councils declared that Jesus was both fully God,
begotten from the Father; and fully man, taking His flesh and human
nature from the Virgin Mary. These two natures, human and divine,
were [hypostatically](Hypostatic_union "Hypostatic union") united
into the one personhood of Jesus Christ.
