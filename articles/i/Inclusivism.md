"**Inclusivism** posits that even though the work of Christ is the
only means of salvation, it does not follow that explicit knowledge
of Christ is necessary in order for one to be saved. In contrast to
[pluralism](Pluralism "Pluralism"), inclusivism agrees with
[exclusivism](Exclusivism "Exclusivism") in affirming the
particularity of salvation in Jesus Christ. But unlike exclusivism,
inclusivism holds that an implicit faith response to general
revelation can be salvific. God expects from man a response
proportional to the light given. Saving faith is not characterized
so much by its cognitive content as it is by its reverent
quality."^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Private inclusivism

"Private inclusivism contends that one who is accepted by God apart
from the preaching of the Gospel is saved in spite of whatever
religion to which he may be an adherent. His religious orientation
plays no part in his salvation and in fact is a definite hindrance.
The non-Christian’s ignorant beliefs, if sincere, are inculpable
but have no positive role in his relationship with God."
^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Corporate inclusivism

"Corporate inclusivism... argues that the non-Christian religions
mediate the work of Christ." ^[[3]](#note-2)^

## Favorable arguments cited

-   Romans 2 indicates that there are justified law-doers without
    exposure to the Law--law-doers not in the sense of sinless
    perfection, but in the sense of the obedience of those in Romans
    2:7,9.
-   Passages such as
    [Acts 4:12](index.php?title=Acts_4&action=edit&redlink=1 "Acts 4 (page does not exist)")
    indicate the ontological necessity of Christ's work, but not
    knowledge of that work.
-   People like
    [Cornelius](index.php?title=Cornelius&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cornelius (page does not exist)")
    and [Melchizedek](Melchizedek "Melchizedek") show that one can be a
    God-fearer who pleases God, in right relationship, before hearing
    special revelation.
-   That infants who die
    [are saved](Infant_salvation "Infant salvation"), without respect
    to faith or lineage (something that almost all proponents of
    exclusivism hold), shows that special revelation is not absolutely
    necessary for salvation.
-   That God is loving and good infers that God would save the
    unreached.
-   It would be unjust of God to damn those without knowledge of
    the gospel.

## Criticisms

Critics of inclusivism argue that
[general revelation](Revelation_of_God#General_revelation "Revelation of God"),
or anything else for that matter besides Christ himself, is not
sufficient for [salvation](Salvation "Salvation").

"...men, not professing the Christian religion, [cannot] be saved
in any other way whatsoever, be they never so diligent to frame
their lives according to the light of nature, and the laws of that
religion they do profess. And,
*to assert and maintain that they may, is very pernicious, and to be detested*.
^[[4]](#note-3)^
The only way to the father is through Jesus (John 14:6),
furthermore, "he who does not have the Son of God does not have
life" (1 John 5:12). Most emphatically, [Paul](Paul "Paul")
declares:

"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. How,
then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how
can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how
can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they
preach unless they are sent." (Romans 10:13-15)
It is important to notice Paul's breakdown in his series of
questions: "calling on", "believing in", "hearing about",
"preaching to", and "being sent." "The clear implications of these
questions is that if missionaries are not sent to preach the gospel
of Christ to those who have not heard about him in order that they
may *hear* about him, *believe* in him, and *call* upon his name
for salvation, these unevangelized people, who are condemned
already, will remain unsaved and cannot and will not be saved by
any other means." ^[[5]](#note-4)^

### Romans 2

Moreover, although inclusivists use Romans 2 to support their view,
it becomes clear upon a close and consistent reading of the text
that inclusivism does not make sense of verse 12. Paul asserts
that, "For all who have sinned without the law will also perish
without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be
judged by the law." Most commentators equate the "law" with special
revelation. Thus, this passage states that those without special
revelation (i.e., those without the law) *still* perish. It becomes
difficult to understand how "those who have sinned without the law"
will somehow be saved, or "included", when Paul explains
*very clearly* that they will "also perish without the law."
Inclusivists must deal with this Pauline affirmation that both -
those with the law and those without the law - perish.

### Salvation in the OT

Portions of this debate hinge on one's understanding of salvation
in the Old Testament. Inclusivists generally claim that Jews in the
OT were saved apart from Jesus and that this warrants a similar
view today. [Robert Reymond](Robert_Reymond "Robert Reymond")
argues in his *A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith*
(1998) that salvation in the OT was in fact seen through Israel's
faith in the promised Messiah.^[[6]](#note-5)^ This is consistently
seen as a trust in God and in his promises of which is both seen in
the present and in the future. Thus, Israel was to trust God to
deliver them from their present suffering (e.g., the Exodus), and
they were to trust God that he would deliver them from their future
sufferings through the Messiah. In these regards, deliverance
(i.e., salvation) was always placed in a God who revealed himself
to the nation Israel who hoped and look forward to His promise of
the coming Messiah. Lastly, the *Westminster Confession of Faith*
asserts the following:

"...by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal
lamb, and other types of ordinances delivered to the people of the
Jews, all foresignifying Christ to come; which were, for that time,
sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of the Spirit, to
instruct and build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah,
by whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal salvation."
(VII.5)
## Notable quotes with an inclusive tenor

-   "We can safely say (i) if any good pagan reached the point of
    throwing himself on His Maker's mercy for pardon, it was grace that
    brought him there; (ii) God will surely save anyone he brings thus
    far; (iii) anyone thus saved would learn in the next world that he
    was saved through Christ" ^[[7]](#note-6)^

-   "So what of the more mature persons who have sinned
    consciously, but have never heard (and are therefore in no position
    to accept with explicit faith) the gospel of God’s matchless love
    for the whole world? May it not be that ‘God our Savior, who wants
    all men to be saved’ (1 Tim. 2:4), and does not want ‘anyone to
    perish’ (2 Pet. 3:9), quickens in some men by his Spirit a
    consciousness of sin and need, and enables them, n the twilight, to
    cast themselves on his mercy? If so, then they, too, would be saved
    by the grace of God in Christ alone." ^[[8]](#note-7)^

-   "God can illuminate whom and when he will, even without the
    external ministry, which is a thing appertaining to his power."
    ^[[9]](#note-8)^

-   "elect infants, dying in infancy, are regenerated and saved by
    Christ through the Spirit, who worketh when, and where, and how he
    pleaseth." "So also are all other elect persons, who are incapable
    of being outwardly called by the ministry of the word."
    ^[[10]](#note-9)^

-   "The benefit of the death of Christ is...extended...even unto
    those who are inevitably excluded from this knowledge. Even these
    may be partakers of the benefit of His death, though ignorant of
    the history, if they suffer His grace to take place in their
    hearts, so as of wicked men to become holy." ^[[11]](#note-10)^

-   "That some unevangelized men are saved, in the present life, by
    an extraordinary exercise of redeeming grace in Christ, has been
    the hope and belief of Christendom. It was the hope and belief of
    the elder Calvinists, as of the later." ^[[12]](#note-11)^

-   "Those also can attain to everlasting salvation who through no
    fault of their own do not know the gospel of Christ or His Church,
    yet sincerely seek God and, moved by grace, strive by their deeds
    to do His will as it is known to them by the dictates of their
    conscience." ^[[13]](#note-12)^

-   [C. S. Lewis](C._S._Lewis "C. S. Lewis") - "We do know that no
    person can be saved except through Christ; we do not know that only
    those who know Him can be saved by Him." ^[[14]](#note-13)^
-   [John Stott](John_Stott "John Stott") - "I have never been able
    to conjure up (as some great Evangelical missionaries have) the
    appalling vision of the millions who are not only perishing but
    will inevitably perish. On the other hand… I am not and cannot be a
    universalist. Between these extremes I cherish and hope that the
    majority of the human race will be saved. And I have a solid
    biblical basis for this belief." ^[[15]](#note-14)^
-   [Billy Graham](Billy_Graham "Billy Graham") - "And that's what
    God is doing today, He's calling people out of the world for His
    name, whether they come from the Muslim world, or the Buddhist
    world, or the Christian world or the non-believing world, they are
    members of the Body of Christ because they've been called by God.
    They may not even know the name of Jesus but they know in their
    hearts that they need something that they don't have, and they turn
    to the only light that they have, and I think that they are saved,
    and that they're going to be with us in heaven."
    ^[[16]](#note-15)^
