## In the Old Testament

"At least five positions have been taken on the issue of whether or
not ordinary, individual members of the
[old covenant](index.php?title=Old_covenant&action=edit&redlink=1 "Old covenant (page does not exist)")
remnant were continually indwelt by the
[Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit")... On the issue of the Spirit’s
role in the lives of believers, some scholars see basic continuity
from the old to the new covenant. These authors argue that the old
covenant remnant was both [regenerate](Regeneration "Regeneration")
and indwelt by the Spirit... Another set of scholars agrees that
old covenant believers experienced both regeneration and
indwelling, but seek to incorporate texts like John 7:39 into their
understanding by using language that allows for a greater or
heightened experience of the Spirit under the new covenant.
Nevertheless, these scholars see no fundamental change in the way
believers experience the Spirit when the new covenant is
inaugurated... The third position is the midpoint of the possible
views. These scholars indicate that they see OT saints as
regenerate by the Spirit but not indwelt by the Spirit... The next
position is for those who see the old covenant remnant as operated
upon but not indwelt by the Spirit. Unlike those in the previous
category, these scholars stop short of using the word regeneration
with reference to the old covenant faithful... At the opposite end
of the spectrum from those who affirm full continuity between the
old and new covenant ministries of the Spirit would be those who
affirm that the Spirit had nothing to do with the faithfulness of
the old covenant remnant... There are... a number of interpreters
who stress the new nature of the Spirit’s ministry after the Christ
event but offer no explanation of how old covenant believers became
and remained faithful." -James Hamilton
