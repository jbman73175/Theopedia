"**Inerrancy** is the view that when all the facts become known,
they will demonstrate that the [Bible](Bible "Bible")
*in its original autographs* and correctly interpreted is entirely
true and never false in all it affirms, whether that relates to
doctrines or ethics or to the social, physical, or life
sciences."^[[1]](#note-0)^ The conservative evangelical stance on
inerrancy was most recently and thoroughly articulated in 1978 in
the
[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy](Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy "Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy").

## The original autographs

According to the Chicago Statement and in general agreement within
the evangelical community at large, strict inerrancy applies only
to the original autographs (i.e. the very first manuscripts
written). This leads to the conclusion that, "no present manuscript
or copy of Scripture, no matter how accurate, can be called
inerrant." ^[[2]](#note-1)^ Nonetheless, one should not worry, for
when we understand the
[Reliability of the New Testament](Reliability_of_the_New_Testament "Reliability of the New Testament")
and the
[Reliability of the Old Testament](Reliability_of_the_Old_Testament "Reliability of the Old Testament"),
we may have confidence that our current Bibles are 98% accurate,
and no major doctrine is affected by the manuscript variants.
Likewise, the Bible has proved itself reliable through prophecy,
historical events, archaeology, and in many other areas.

There are some from the past who believed that God perfectly
preserved the autographs in the apographs (copies).
[Francis Turretin](Francis_Turretin "Francis Turretin") wrote in
his
[Systematic Theology](Systematic_Theology "Systematic Theology"),
"By 'original texts' we do not mean the very autographs from the
hands of [Moses](Moses "Moses"), the [prophets](Prophet "Prophet"),
and the [apostles](Apostle "Apostle"), which are known to be
nonexistent. We mean copies (apographa), which have come in their
name, because they record for us that word of God in the same words
into which the sacred writers committed it under the immediate
[inspiration](Inspiration "Inspiration") of the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit")."^[[3]](#note-2)^

## Proper interpretation

Although we may have confidence in the Bible texts we have today
(based on the inerrancy of the original), there remains the
possibility of different interpretations. This should not be taken
as a negative against the doctrine of inerrancy. An interpretation
that contradicts what seems to be the clear sense of other
Scripture does not necessarily imply that the text is in error.
More than likely the interpretation is at fault, and not the text.
A famous quote from [Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") says, "it is
not allowable to say, 'The author of this book is mistaken'; but
either the manuscript is faulty, or the translation is wrong, or
you have not understood".
^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

## Inerrancy and infallibility

Some scholars see *infallibility* as a less restrictive term than
"inerrancy" in discussing the reliability of the Bible. For
example, Davis suggests "The Bible is inerrant if and only if it
makes no false or misleading statements on any topic whatsoever.
The Bible is infallible if and only if it makes no false or
misleading statements on any matter of faith and practice."
^[[4]](#note-3)^ Thus Davis argues that infallibility does not
necessitate a doctrine of inerrancy. In this sense, infallibility
is seen as a nuanced and less-restrictive view of the Bible's
reliability.

However, others see it the other way around, i.e. infallibility is
the stronger term and specifically implies inerrancy. In article
XI, the
[Chicago Statement](Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy "Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy")
says, "We deny that it is possible for the Bible to be at the same
time infallible and errant in its assertions. Infallibility and
inerrancy may be distinguished, but not separated." This then is
contrary to Davis' view above.

Further, in article XII, the Chicago statement says, "We deny that
Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual,
religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the
fields of history and science."

Adding to the potential confusion is the layman's tendency to use
the terms interchangeably.

## Covers all disciplines of knowledge

"This last point emphasizes the extent of inerrancy extends to all
areas in which it speaks. The Bible makes no distinction between
religious matters and non-religious matters. All matters are dealt
with in an error-free way. This includes areas of history, science,
and geography as well as theology."^[[5]](#note-4)^ The official
exposition of "Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy" gives the
following qualification:

"When total precision of a particular kind was not expected nor
aimed at, it is no error not to have achieved it. Scripture is
inerrant, not in the sense of being absolutely precise by modern
standards, but in the sense of making good its claims and achieving
that measure of focused truth at which its authors aimed."
[B.B. Warfield](B.B._Warfield "B.B. Warfield") wrote that an author
in the Bible could

"share the ordinary opinions of his day in certain matters lying
outside the scope of his teachings, as, for example, with reference
to the form of the earth, or its relation to the sun; and, it is
not inconceivable that the form of his language when incidentally
adverting to such matters, might occasionally play into the hands
of such a presumption."^[[6]](#note-5)^

## Criticism

Inerrancy does not come without criticism. Most recently, New
Testament scholar [Bart Ehrman](Bart_Ehrman "Bart Ehrman") has
written a popular-level book entitled *Misquoting Jesus*
(HarperOne, 2005) where he asks the question, "how does it help us
to say that the Bible is the inerrant word of God if in fact we
don't have the words that God inerrantly inspired, but only the
words copied by the scribes - sometimes correctly but sometimes
(many times!) incorrectly? What good is it to say that the
autographs (i.e., the originals) were inspired? We don't *have* the
originals! We have only error-ridden copies, and the vast majority
of these are centuries removed from the originals and different
from them, evidently, in thousands of ways," (p. 7).

Ehrman's outcry is vastly overstated. Through the use of
[textual criticism](Biblical_criticism#Textual_criticism.2C_or_Lower_criticism "Biblical criticism")
scholars are able to find what the original text was with great
accuracy, and thus, Christians have no reason to worry because we
"don't have the originals." Ehrman appears skeptical of the many
copies and the differences they contain, yet unfairly writes as
though these differences were monumental so as to effect the very
foundation of the Christian faith. Most of the differences in the
manuscripts involve missing words, spelling errors, or other minor
variants. When, for example, one text differs greatly from another
two-hundred identical ones, it is obvious to scholars that more
than likely it was a scribal addition and should be studied more
critically. Those concerned in the inerrancy of the Bible should be
asking "what differences are present in the manuscripts we have
available?" and "are there so many differences that it is
impossible to tell what was originally written (or recorded)?"
Rather than becoming skeptics because of errant copies, those
interested should invest time in the topic as it will become
increasingly clear that the Bible being read today is entirely
accurate and reliable.

Other critics of inerrancy dispute the doctrine because it seems to
rest on Modernist theories about the objectivity of written
texts,^[[7]](#note-6)^ and because the absolutism implied by the
doctrine regarding the Bible's veracity in areas of history and
science seems false when rigorously examined. Critics and
proponents of inerrancy are currently engaged in vigorous debate
regarding the limitations of human language implied by
postmodernism, and whether these limitations invalidate current
formulations of the doctrine of inerrancy.
