**Infant baptism** (also called *paedobaptism*, *covenant baptism*,
and *household baptism*) is the most common form of baptism
practiced in Christianity throughout its history. ^[[1]](#note-0)^
As the name indicates, it is baptism for a person while an infant
or child, commonly performed within the first two years of life. In
Protestant traditions of paedobaptism, since such a baptism does
not require the active participation of the baptized (as with a
"[believer's baptism](Believer's_baptism "Believer's baptism")"),
the intent of the act and the liturgies of the worship services
surrounding it are quite different from adult or believer's
baptism. Whereas a believer's baptism is a willful act of the
baptized, infant baptism is considered to be a symbolic
*as well as mysterious* act of God by which a claim is placed upon
the child's life by God and the Church. Such a claim does not
ensure the salvation of the baptized, as believed within the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church"),
but rather follows the Biblical tradition of God's calling people
to himself and that the hope of what is to come is not found within
the abilities or effectiveness of the baptized but within God
himself. Thus the freedom that the Church has to baptize children
relies on the basis that God's purposes will be accomplished
despite the frailty of the baptized Church. This freedom is
confirmed within [Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") theology as a
continuance of the [sacrament](Sacrament "Sacrament") of
[circumcision](index.php?title=Circumcision&action=edit&redlink=1 "Circumcision (page does not exist)")
under the
[Abrahamic covenant](Abrahamic_covenant "Abrahamic covenant").

In many Protestant traditions which practice paedobaptism,
particularly Reformed, a young adult will re-iterate the commitment
of baptism through what is commonly called
"[confirmation](index.php?title=Confirmation&action=edit&redlink=1 "Confirmation (page does not exist)")."
As a culmination of church classes, and perhaps a more personal
mentoring as well, the young adult who has learned the rudiments of
discipleship and his or her relationship to God and his people will
*confirm* this understanding and commitment to it as a basis of his
or her life.

## Support

### Historical

One argument in support of the baptism of infants comes from the
fact that controversy over the practice is conspicuously absent
from the history of the early church. There is no question that
[Origen](Origen "Origen") was baptized as an infant in 180 A.D.,
just 80 years after the death of the last Apostle, John the
Evangelist. There are other possible references to infant baptism
at earlier dates, but these references are somewhat unclear in
their meaning. Born in the mid fourth century (358 A.D.),
[Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") wrote, "This doctrine is held by
the whole church, not instituted by councils, but always retained."
[Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian") (*ca.* 155-230) did argue in
favor of
[believer's baptism](Believer's_baptism "Believer's baptism"), but
this was in reaction to the un-biblical practice that was being
taught in some areas that Christians should wait to be baptized
until just before death, and not in reaction to infant baptism.
[Francis Schaeffer](Francis_Schaeffer "Francis Schaeffer") argued,
"Those who would teach that the practice of the early Church was
not infant baptism should be able to show in Church History when it
started. There is no such break recorded."

### Narrative biblical passages

Acts 2:38-39 
  ~ "And Peter said to them, 'Repent and be baptized every one of
    you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins,
    and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise
    is for *you and for your children* and for all who are far off,
    everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.'"

Acts 16:14-15 
  ~ "One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of
    Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The
    Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.
    And after she was baptized, *and her household as well*, she urged
    us, saying, 'If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come
    to my house and stay.' And she prevailed upon us."

Acts 16:29-34 
  ~ "The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling
    before Paul and Silas. He then brought them out and asked, 'Sirs,
    what must I do to be saved?' They replied, 'Believe in the Lord
    Jesus, and you will be saved -- *you and your household*.' Then
    they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his
    house. At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed
    their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized.
    The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them;
    he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God —-
    *he and his whole family*."

*(Emphasis added.)*

Supporters of infant baptism note that in the Acts 2 passage, "the
promise is for you and your children..." in contradistinction to
the adults present at Peter's address. The households of Lydia and
the Philippian jailer were baptized. At issue is whether these
households included children, and if those children were able to
make a credible profession.

Those opposed to infant baptism note that the above passages are
silent as to whether the households contained children, and
(correctly) observe the weakness of an argument from silence.

While western culture emphasizes individual salvation, some
supporters of infant baptism observe that God has expanded the
extension of grace beyond individuals to families and households.

### Didactic biblical passages

I Corinthians 1:14-16 
  ~ "I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus
    and Gaius, so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.
    (Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I
    don't remember if I baptized anyone else.) For Christ did not send
    me to baptize, but to preach the gospel -- not with words of human
    wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power."

Colossians 2:11-12 
  ~ "In him also ﻿you were circumcised with a circumcision made
    without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the
    circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in
    which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful
    working of God, who raised him from the dead."

Supporters of infant baptism observe the linkage in Colossians
among circumcision, baptism, and life in Christ.

### Parallels between OT and NT

Based on the linkage in Colossians, supporters of paedobaptism note
that circumcision and baptism are both [signs](Sign "Sign") and
[seals](Seal "Seal") of the covenant of grace.

Gen 17:9-14 
  ~ Then God said to Abraham, "As for you, you must keep my
    covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to
    come. This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you,
    the covenant you are to keep: Every male among you shall be
    circumcised. You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the
    sign of the covenant between me and you. For the generations to
    come every male among you who is eight days old must be
    circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with
    money from a foreigner —- those who are not your offspring. Whether
    born in your household or bought with your money, they must be
    circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting
    covenant. Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in
    the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my
    covenant."

A few observations about Genesis 17.

-   The [covenant](Covenant "Covenant") was between God and
    [Abraham](Abraham "Abraham").
-   The covenant was also between God and Abraham's descendants.
-   The [sign](Sign "Sign") of the covenant was in
    [circumcision](index.php?title=Circumcision&action=edit&redlink=1 "Circumcision (page does not exist)").
-   The eight-day-old male could not give his assent to enter into
    a covenant with God. It was the covenental relationship of the
    male's father with God that demanded the circumcision.
-   Compliance with the [sign](Sign "Sign") of
    [circumcision](index.php?title=Circumcision&action=edit&redlink=1 "Circumcision (page does not exist)")
    was commanded; it was not optional.
-   Circumcision was commanded for *all* of the *household*. In
    particular, it was not just for the believing Abraham, but also
    for:
    -   the never-to-believe Ishmael, and
    -   the not-yet-believing Isaac, and
    -   those slaves that Abraham purchased.

-   The sign of circumcision was given on the basis of Abraham's
    covenant with God, not on the basis of the recipient's covenant.

Romans 4:11 
  ~ And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
    righteousness that he had by faith while he was still
    uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but
    have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be
    credited to them.

A few observations about Romans 4:11.

-   The "he" is Abraham.
-   Circumcision is a [seal](Seal "Seal").
-   The sealing ordinance is for "all who believe."

### Possible objections anticipated

Here are some possible objections to the infant baptism point of
view.

#### No examples

While there are no explicit examples of infant baptism, it should
be noted that the doctrine of the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") or
the personhood of the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") are
also constructed arguments. These arguments in support of infant
baptism are also constructive arguments.

#### Salvation conferred by baptism

While [Catholicism](Catholicism "Catholicism") asserts that baptism
is salvific, the adherents of infant baptism do not believe that
the baptism in and of itself confers salvation. The Reformed
adherants baptize not to save infants, but because they are
commanded by a sovereign God who is able to save.

Note that in Acts 8:13, Simon the Sorcerer "believed and was
baptized." This did *not* confer salvation. See vv 21-22,
especially "you are full of bitterness and captive to sin." No true
believer would be a "captive to sin." Even
[credobaptists](Believer's_baptism "Believer's baptism") would be
hard pressed to believe that baptism is sufficient for salvation.

## Criticism

### Historical

One of the arguments against the practice of paedobaptism is the
fact that its theological foundation was not developed until
[Ulrich Zwingli](Huldreich_Zwingli "Huldreich Zwingli") in the
sixteenth century. Some would attribute this to his desire to
salvage the long-standing tradition of infant baptism in the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism") by
finding a way to make the doctrine fit with Scripture. Opponents
argue that if baptism is such a prominent theme - if it is
commanded of the Church alongside the necessity of so basic a
doctrine as repentance - then why did it take more than 1500 years
to develop Scriptural support for baptizing infants?

According to earlier sources, infant baptism was a topic of
discussion during the times of the early church. Without argument,
infant baptism was even practiced by some at this time, claiming
that the practice was apostolic tradition. Yet Tertullian, who is
often recognized as a staunch defender of apostolic traditions,
gave no defense for infant baptism.

According to the Didache, which served as an early church manual,
instructions for baptism imply it is adults that are baptized:
> "Before the baptism, moreover, the one who baptizes and the one
> being baptized must fast, and any others who can. And you must tell
> the one being baptized to fast for one or two days
> beforehand."^[[2]](#note-1)^

### Biblical

Perhaps the most well-known argument against paedobaptism is the
fact the Bible contains no explicit examples of the practice.
Rather, proponents of the doctrine point to accounts in the book of
Acts that record the baptism of entire households and argue that
the text implicitly includes infants, such as the examples above.
However, [credobaptists](Believer's_baptism "Believer's baptism")
(those who believe that faith must precede baptism) argue that the
context of both passages demonstrates that the conditions for
baptism include, repentance, hearing the Word, and faithfulness to
the Lord.

Other New Testament verses which imply adult decisions as
prerequisites for baptism include:

Matthew 3:5-6 
  ~ "Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the
    Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the
    river Jordan, *confessing their sins*."

Galatians 3:27 
  ~ "For as many of you as were baptized into Christ
    *have put on Christ*."

Col. 2:12 
  ~ "...having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were
    also raised with him
    *through faith in the powerful working of God*, who raised him from
    the dead."
