**Infant salvation** is a question specifically asked regarding the
eternal destiny of those who die in infancy. Scripture is not
explicit on this issue, hence arguments are based on general
theological principles and inference from Scripture.

[Reformed theology](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology") has
generally maintained the [salvation](Salvation "Salvation") of
those who die in infancy; yet they have done so without
compromising the doctrines of
[original sin](Original_sin "Original sin"), the
[atonement](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ"), and/or
[justification](Justification "Justification") as has been the case
in many arguments. The Reformed perspective is confirmed by
[B. B. Warfield](B._B._Warfield "B. B. Warfield") in his excellent
essay on the doctrine of infant salvation. Therein he states,

Today few Calvinists can be found who do not hold . . . that all
who die in infancy are the children of God and enter at once into
His glory -- not because original sin alone is not deserving of
eternal punishment, nor because they are less guilty than others,
nor because they die in infancy, but simply because God in His
infinite love has chosen them in Christ before the foundation of
the world.^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Passages cited in support of infant salvation

-   "[David] answered, "While the child was still alive, I fasted
    and wept. I thought, 'Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and
    let the child live.' 23 But now that he is dead, why should I fast?
    Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not
    return to me." (2 Sam. 12:22-23, NIV)
-   "Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not
    hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.""
    (Matt. 19:14, NIV). See also Mark 10:14, Luke 18:16.
-   Some theologians have contended that Revelation 7:9 also
    supports this view, "How can there be in heaven a countless number
    of people from every nation, tribe, people and language (Rev. 7:9,
    NIV)? Surely not every tribe of people around the world has adult
    believers. Is it not possible, therefore, that a number of tribes
    will be represented by children who die in infancy?" (Swindoll,
    2003).
