**Infused righteousness** refers to the Roman Catholic doctrine of
[Justification](Justification "Justification"), i.e. right standing
before God. Within the Roman Catholic view,
[Justification](Justification "Justification") is seen as a
"process" as contrasted to the Protestant view of a moment-in-time
forensic declaration by God that the sinner is
righteous.^[[1]](#note-0)^ The instrumental cause of infused
righteousness are the sacraments of baptism and
penance^[[2]](#note-1)^, where as the instrumental cause of
[imputed righteousness](Imputed_righteousness "Imputed righteousness")
is faith.^[[3]](#note-2)^ Roman Catholicism maintains that the
righteousness of the saints and of Christ is gradually "infused"
into the believer through the sacraments. For the Catholic, infused
righteousness either gradually dissipates as the believer takes
part in worldly sins or is enhanced by good works. If the believer
dies without having the fullness of righteousness, coming in part
from the last rites, he or she will temporarily spend time in
[purgatory](Purgatory "Purgatory") until the sinful status is
purged from his or her record.

For the Roman Catholic, the believer is made righteous by
cooperating with God's grace. For the Protestant, the believer is
*declared* righteous when he comes to faith, based on the
righteousness of Christ credited (imputed) to him.
