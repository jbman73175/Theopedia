**Inspiration** establishes that the [Bible](Bible "Bible") is a
divine product. In other words, Scripture is divinely *inspired* in
that God actively worked through the process and had his hand in
the outcome of what Scripture would say. Inspired Scripture is
simply written revelation. "Scripture is not only man's word, but
also, and equally God's word, spoken through man's lips or written
with man's pen" ([J.I. Packer](J.I._Packer "J.I. Packer"),
*The Origin of the Bible*, p. 31).

The term comes from Latin and English translations of the Greek
word *theopneustos* in 2 Timothy 3:16. The [KJV](KJV "KJV") renders
it "inspiration", while the [RSV](RSV "RSV") uses "inspired of
God". However, the word literally means "God-breathed".

-   2 Peter 1:19-21 (ESV)

And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you
will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place,
until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,
knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from
someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by
the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along
by the Holy Spirit.
-   2 Timothy 3:16 (ESV)

All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching,
for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.
## Views on the extent of inspiration

There are tyipcally four main views that are associated with the
doctrine of Inspiration.

### Neo-orthodox

A common belief of [neo-orthodoxy](Neo-orthodoxy "Neo-orthodoxy")
is its view of the utter
[transcendence of God](Transcendence_of_God "Transcendence of God").
That is, God is so completely different and set apart from us that
we cannot comprehend him apart from his revelation to us (this
entails a rejection of
[natural theology](Natural_theology "Natural theology")). The issue
appears when neo-orthodoxy is compared to
[Evangelicalism](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") regarding what
the title "Word of God" means. Proponents of neo-orthodoxy claimed
the Word of God was God himself, and thus the Bible is a *witness*
to the Word of God. As a witness, the Bible cannot *be* the Word of
God (i.e. God is not the Bible), but the Bible still remains a
mediator of the Word of God in some manner. Because the writers
were finite and sinful, they were capable of error in their
writings. Thus, while the writers of the Old and New Testament
recorded their experiences and witness to revelation, their
writings may contain errors. Problems with this account are raised
when one understands that Scripture *is* God's Word (2 Tim 3:16)
and that people were inspired by the Holy Spirit (2 Pet 1:20-21).
They were not merely accounts of each person's experience with
God.

### Dictation

Although not popular, the dictation theory is prevelant within some
conservative Christian circles. This view expresses the belief that
God simply dictated what he wanted to be written down. Therefore,
all the author did was write down as he was told from God and the
end product is the Word of God. Although Scripture does portray
this idea (Jer 26:2; Rev 2:1,8), this is not the way *all* of it
was written. At other times authors expressed their own
personalities (Gal 1:6, 3:1; Phil 1:3, 4, 8) and the Holy Spirit
still insured that the writings reflected God's desired outcome.

### Limited inspiration

This view proposes that Scripture is inspired, yet it is limited to
certain aspects. It affirms that God guided the writers, yet also
allowed them the freedom to express their own thoughts regarding
history and experiences they had. This allows the Bible to contain
historical errors, yet, it is claimed that the Holy Spirit
protected writers against any doctrinal error. Thus, the Bible may
contain historical errors but it remains a reliable source of
doctrine. Problems with this view appear in its rejection of the
historical trustworthiness of Scripture.
[Archaeology](Biblical_archaeology "Biblical archaeology") has
proven many biblical accounts (and even removed earlier
difficulties) correct, and although the Bible is divinely inspired
it also remains a historical document that contains accurate
details. This view appears to easily conclude that errors may be
possible within difficult passages whereas this is not the case.

*See main pages: [Historicity of the Old](Historicity_of_the_Old_Testament "Historicity of the Old Testament") and [New Testament](Historicity_of_the_New_Testament "Historicity of the New Testament")*
### Plenary verbal inspiration

The word *plenary* means "full" or "complete". Therefore, plenary
verbal inspiration asserts that God inspired the complete text(s)
of the Bible, from [Genesis](Genesis "Genesis") to
[Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation"), including
both historical and doctrinal details. The word *verbal* affirms
the idea that inspiration extends to the very words the writers
chose. For example, in Acts 1:16 the [Apostle Peter](Peter "Peter")
says "the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake" (KJV).
[Paul](Paul "Paul") calls all scripture "God-breathed" in
[2 Timothy 3:16](2_Timothy_3#16 "2 Timothy 3") (referring to the
Old Testament). Thus, the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit")
guided the writers along (cf. 2 Peter 1:20-21) while allowing their
own personalities and freedom to produce the Bible we have today.
This view recognizes and asserts both the human and divine element
within Scripture. This understanding has sometimes been compared
and contrasted to the understanding of the
[two natures of Jesus](Two_natures_of_Jesus "Two natures of Jesus").

## Four things inspiration is not

In order to insure the clarity of what inspiration is and is not,
the following four points should be helpful:

\1) The idea is not of mechanical dictation, or automatic writing,
 or any process which involved the suspending of the action of the
 human writer's mind. Such concepts of inspiration are found in the
 [Talmud](Talmud "Talmud"),
 [Philo](index.php?title=Philo&action=edit&redlink=1 "Philo (page does not exist)"),
 and the [Fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers"), but
 not in the Bible. The divine direction and control under which the
 biblical authors wrote was not a physical or psychological force,
 and it did not detract from but rather heightened the freedom,
 spontaneity, and creativeness of their writing.

\2) The fact that in inspiration God did not obliterate the
 personality, style, outlook, and cultural conditioning of his
 penmen does not mean that his control of them was imperfect, or
 that they inevitably distorted the truth they had been given to
 convey in the process of writing it down.
 [B.B. Warfield](B.B._Warfield "B.B. Warfield") gently mocks the
 notion that, when God wanted Paul's letters written,

He was reduced to the necessity of going down to earth and
painfully scrutinizing the men He found there, seeking anxiously
for the one who, on the whole, promised best for His purpose; and
then violently forcing the material He wished expressed through
him, against his natural bent, and with as little loss from his
recalcitrant characteristics as possible. Of course, nothing of the
sort took place. If God wished to give His people a series of
letters like Paul's, He prepared a Paul to write them, and the Paul
He brought to the task was a Paul who spontaneously would write
just such letters (*The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible*).
\3) Inspiredness is not a quality attaching to corruptions that
 intrude in the course of the transmission of the text, but only to
 the text as originally produced by the inspired writers. The
 acknowledgement of biblical inspiration thus makes more urgent the
 task of meticulous
 [textual criticism](Textual_Criticism "Textual Criticism"), in
 order to eliminate such corruptions and ascertain what the original
 text was.

\4) The inspiredness of the biblical writing is not to be equated
 with the inspiredness of great literature, not even when (as is
 often true) the biblical writing is in fact great literature. The
 biblical idea of inspiration relates not to the literary quality of
 what is written, but to its character as divine revelation in
 writing.
