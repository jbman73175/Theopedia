**Intelligent design** is a controversial topic that finds itself
in the realm of science, [theology](Theology "Theology"), and
[apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics"). Adherents of this view
state that the best explanation for the origin of the universe and
humanity is not [evolution](Evolution "Evolution"), but "an
intelligent cause or agent, as opposed to an unguided process such
as natural selection." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

Some have criticized this view, stating that it is not based on the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") and restricts itself to
[natural theology](Natural_theology "Natural theology"). Proponents
agree, but are quick to point out that Intelligent design implies
that life is here as a result of the purposeful action of an
intelligent designer, standing in contrast to Darwinian
evolution.^[[2]](#note-1)^ More frequent are attacks from advocates
of evolutionary thought. ID has yet to gain mainstream acceptance
in the scientific community. However, there are mainstream
scientists who do a accept this view, even if they are not
young-earth creationists. This notably includes
[The Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness (IDEA) Center](http://www.ideacenter.org/)
and Michael Behe, professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University
and advisory board member at IDEA.

## Arguments from Behe's *Darwin's Black Box*

In his book *Darwin's Black Box* (1998), Michael Behe says that
"the conclusion of intelligent design flows naturally from the data
itself - not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs. Inferring that
biochemical systems were designed by an intelligent agent is a
humdrum process that requires no new principles of logic or
science. It comes simply from the hard work that biochemistry has
done over the past forty years, combined with the consideration of
the way in which we reach conclusions of design every day."
^[[3]](#note-2)^

Behe goes on to talk about "irreducible complexity" which is
shorthand for the view that sometimes the most basic pieces of a
system must all be in place in order for the pieces a)not to harm
the organism, and b) to make any sense in the supposed natural
selection process. For example, considering a mousetrap, it would
be hard to think of a way for the "pieces" of a mouse trap to
gradually be introduced in this process since the individual pieces
would have no value. In order for a mouse trap to function, the
basics of the trap must be in place. A mousetrap would be
"irreducibly complex."

In one of his real-world examples, Behe writes about the blood
clotting process.^[[4]](#note-3)^ All the chemicals of the blood
clotting process must be present and triggered in the right
sequence from the start, otherwise death would result to the
animal. If the clotting factors were not present, any cut would
cause life-threatening bleeding. If the clotting factor is
triggered too early, the entire blood stream would solidify, and if
the clotting factor was activated more quickly then the body would
not have the means to flush much of the dirt and infection present
in many initial wounds.

A final example is the bombadier beetle.^[[5]](#note-4)^ How do the
chemicals used by this beetle evolve to exist in the same organism,
but kept separate so the beetle doesn't blow itself up? How do the
chamber and mechanisms evolve to allow the safe combination of the
chemicals, directing them to an attacker?

Darwin had little knowledge of the complexity of the miniature
structures of the cells and beyond. Behe writes, "Neither of
Darwin's starting points - the origin of life and the origin of
vision - has been accounted for by his theory. Darwin never
imagined the exquisitely profound complexity that exists even at
the most basic levels of life."^[[6]](#note-5)^
