The **intermediate state** describes the period between death and
resurrection. Because it is *intermediate* there is an aspect of
incompleteness, and all of the promises of God are not fully
experienced. What the intermediate state consists of is still
debated, but a few main views persist:

### Without a body

One theory states that when a person dies they will be without a
body. They also propose that we will still be conscious, and will
be waiting for the final resurrection where we will receive our
bodies at that time.

### A spiritual body

Another theory believes that a person will have a kind of spiritual
body, however that may look. At the time of the resurrection this
spiritual body will be lost, and the soul and original body will be
reunited (2 Corinthians 5:1-4).

### No intermediate state at all

Some simply believe that there is no intermediate state, and that
when a person dies he either immediately goes to heaven or to hell.
They will be without a body, but will receive it after the
resurrection. One of these proponents is
[John MacArthur](John_MacArthur "John MacArthur").

### Soul sleep

Proponents of this view believe that after a person dies their soul
goes into a state of sleep or unconsciousness. They come out of
this sleep at the final resurrection.

### Purgatory
