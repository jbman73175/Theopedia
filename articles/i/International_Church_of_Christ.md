The **International Church of Christ**, is a break-off of the
Church of Christ denomination founded in 1979 by Kip McKean. Its
origins may be traced back to 1967 in Gainesville Florida and the
teaching of Charles Lucas in his program called Multiplying
Ministries, which was very successful. McKean began his ministry in
the Crossroads Church of Christ in Florida and eventually became
frustrated with his Churches of Christ denomination, claiming it to
be engrossed with hypocrisy and insincerity. He was offered the
pulpit at a struggling Boston-area congregation called the
Lexington Church of Christ in 1979. It is here McKean implemented
his ideas for a more devoted form of Christianity to remedy the
hypocrisy he supposedly witnessed in his denomination. Under
McKean’s leadership the church was renamed ‘Boston Church of
Christ’ and became the spearhead for his new ICC denomination,
which was also referred to as *the Boston Movement*.

This group is also known under the names The Boston Church of
Christ, The Crossroads Movement, Multiplying Ministries, The
Discipling Movement, The San Diego Church of Christ, etc.

In June 1989, McKean stepped down as Boston Lead Evangelist to
assume a new position as World Missions Evangelist for ICC. The
next year, he moved to Los Angeles, where he continued to lead the
movement for over a decade while also serving as Lead Evangelist of
the Los Angeles International Church of
Christ.[[1]](http://www.rightcyberup.org/news/resignation.html)
McKean resigned from his formal ICC position in 2002, however,
"senior ICC leadership has not announced a single initiative for
change across the
movement.[[2]](http://www.rightcyberup.org/news/resignation.html)
