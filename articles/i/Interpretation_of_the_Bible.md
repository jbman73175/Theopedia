**Hermeneutics** is the science of interpreting what an author has
written. In Christian theology, hermeneutics focuses specifically
on constructing and discovering the appropriate rules for
interpreting the [Bible](Bible "Bible"). These methods and
principles, however, are often drawn from outside of scripture in
historical, literary or other fields. It inevitably involves
[exegesis](Exegesis "Exegesis"), which is the act of interpreting
or explaining the meaning of scripture. The goal in applying the
principles of hermeneutics is to "rightly handle the word of truth"
(2 Tim. 2:15), striving to accurately discern the meaning of the
text.

## Distinct from exegesis

Although one may encounter the terms "hermeneutics" and "exegesis"
used interchangeably, there is a distinction to be maintained.
[Bernard Ramm](Bernard_Ramm "Bernard Ramm") describes the
difference as follows:

"Hermeneutics . . . stands in the same relationship to exegesis
that a rule-book stands to a game. . . . The rules are not the
game, and the game is meaningless without the rules. Hermeneutics
proper is not exegesis, but exegesis is applied
hermeneutics."^[[1]](#note-0)^
Perhaps the closest relation between these two terms would be
"hermeneutics" and "exegetical method."

## Challenges

Applying sound principles of hermeneutics requires answers to a
variety of questions:

-   Who was the writer?
-   To whom were they writing?
-   Is the choice of words, wording, or word order significant in
    this particular passage?
-   What is the cultural, historical context?
-   What was the author's original intended meaning?
-   How did the author's contemporaries understand him?
-   Why did he say it that way?

## General rules of hermeneutics

### One original interpretation

A fundamental belief in hermeneutics is that there is one original
interpretation. When the author of a book recorded history, or
wrote their letter(s) or gospel, they had a single intended meaning
attached to what they wrote. For example, when a person writes a
letter, they are not thinking of how they can write it so that the
receiving person either cannot understand it or ends up with many
different interpretations. Instead, there is a particular meaning
in what was written. The interpretation is restricted by the
writers intentions. Thus, when doing hermeneutics, one should
always be aware of what the authors intended meaning was. This
should guide and direct one's studies, and should also safeguard
against interpretations that do not fit the thought or flow of the
book one is studying.

#### Application

It should be noted that although there is a single interpretation
to be found in each passage, there can be more than one
application. However, these applications should stem *from* the
interpretation and be guided by what Scripture says elsewhere.

### Regard for genre

"A passage might be legal, narrative, polemic, poetry, wisdom,
gospel, logical discourse, or prophetic literature, each having
specific guidelines for proper interpretation."^[[2]](#note-1)^

### Regard for literary devices

"Various forms of Hebrew poetry, simile, metaphor, and hyperbole
need to be recognized if the reader is to understand the passage's
meaning." ^[[3]](#note-2)^

### Regard for literal meaning

A text should be interpreted with the degree of precision intended
by the author. It should be interpreted "according to its literal,
or normal, sense. The literal sense is the grammatical-historical
sense, that is, the meaning which the writer expressed.
Interpretation according to the literal sense will take account of
all figures of speech and literary forms found in the
text."^[[4]](#note-3)^

## Rules specific to the Bible

### Divine accommodation

"The Bible is to be interpreted in view of the fact that it is an
accommodation of Divine truths to human minds: God the infinite
communicating with man the finite... We must be careful, then, not
to push accommodating language about God and His nature to literal
extremes. God does not have feathers and wings (e.g., Psalms 17:8);
nor is He our literal Father in the same sense our earthly father
is."
[Robert Hommel, forananswer.org](http://www.forananswer.org/Top_General/Hermeneutics.htm)

*See main page: [Divine accommodation](Divine_accommodation "Divine accommodation")*
### Progressive revelation

"The Old Testament is the New Testament concealed, and the New
Testament is the Old Testament revealed." "The Word of God is to be
understood from the Old Testament to the New Testament as a flower
unfolding its petals to the morning sun."^[[5]](#note-4)^

### Harmony

"No part of the Bible may be interpreted so as to contradict
another part of the Bible. The Christian presupposes the inerrancy
and harmony of Scripture as a necessary result of a perfect Creator
God revealing Himself perfectly to Mankind."^[[6]](#note-5)^

## The Chicago Statement on Biblical Hermeneutics

The International Council on Biblical Inerrancy produced three
major statements: one on
[biblical inerrancy](Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy "Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy")
in 1978, one on biblical hermeneutics in 1982, and one on biblical
application in 1986.

In similar fashion to the Chicago Statement on Inerrancy of 1978,
the Statement on Hermeneutics presents affirmations and denials as
an expression of the results of labor to clarify hermeneutical
issues and principles. The council did not claim completeness or
systematic treatment of the entire subject, but maintained the
resulting Articles represent a consensus of the approximately one
hundred evangelical scholars gathered at the conference.

## Methods/schools

### Allegorical

"Prior to the Protestant Reformation in the 1500s, biblical
interpretation was often dominated by the allegorical method.
Looking back to Augustine, the medieval church believed that every
biblical passage contained four levels of meaning. These four
levels were the literal, the allegorical, the moral, and the
eschatological. For instance, the word Jerusalem literally referred
to the city itself; allegorically, it refers to the church of
Christ; morally, it indicates the human soul; and eschatologically
it points to the heavenly Jerusalem."^[[7]](#note-6)^

### Grammatico-historical

"[T]his method of interpretation focuses attention not only on
literary forms but upon grammatical constructions and historical
contexts out of which the Scriptures were written. It is solidly in
the 'literal schools' of interpretation, and is the hermeneutical
methodology embraced by virtually all evangelical Protestant
exegetes and scholars."^[[8]](#note-7)^ "The writings of the
earliest Church Fathers
([Ignatius of Antioch](Ignatius_of_Antioch "Ignatius of Antioch"),
[Ireneaus](Ireneaus "Ireneaus"), and
[Justin Martyr](Justin_Martyr "Justin Martyr")) indicate that they
took Scripture literally, unless the context clearly militated
against it."^[[9]](#note-8)^

### Letterism

"While often ignoring context, historical and cultural setting, and
even grammatical structure, letterism takes each word as an
isolated truth. A problem with this method is that it fails to take
into account the different literary genre, or types, in the Bible.
The Hebrew poetry of the Psalms is not to be interpreted in the
same way as is the logical discourse of Romans. Letterism tends to
lead to legalism because of its inability to distinguish between
literary types. All passages tend to become equally binding on
current believers."^[[10]](#note-9)^

### Postmodern

## Role of the Holy Spirit

"Some have wrongly argued that knowledge of the culture and
languages of biblical times is not necessary, that the Holy Spirit
will interpret the text for us. The role of the Holy Spirit is to
illumine the believer in order to accept and apply what is found in
Scripture. The Bible says that the natural man does not accept the
things of the Spirit (1 Cor 2:14). The Greek word for "accept"
means 'to take something willingly and with pleasure.'
*The key role of the Spirit is not to add information to the text*,
or to give us special translating abilities, but to soften our
hearts in order to receive what is there."
[Don Clossom, Probe Ministries](http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/hermen.html)

"[W]e must not say that the Spirit adds more revelation to the
written Word. This denies the
[sufficiency of Scripture](Sola_scriptura "Sola scriptura").
Further, it renders such an interpretation non-falsifiable because
then the Spirit's added revelation is accessible to me only through
you. Finally, it comes perilously close to
[Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth")'s neoorthodox position that the
Bible becomes the Word of God in one's
experience."^[[11]](#note-10)^

*See main page: [Illumination of the Holy Spirit](Illumination_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Illumination of the Holy Spirit")*
## The hermeneutics of Jesus

"[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") condemned the Scribes and Pharisees for
replacing the original intent of the Scriptures with their own
traditions. Jesus took a literal approach to interpretation which
took into account the literary type of the
passage."^[[12]](#note-11)^
