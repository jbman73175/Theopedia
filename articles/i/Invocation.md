An **invocation** is usually a prayer that, in some liturgies,
takes place towards the beginning of
[Lord's Day](Lord's_Day "Lord's Day") [worship](Worship "Worship"),
other [worship](Worship "Worship") settings, or public gatherings.
It is a formal calling upon the name of God, to ask for his
presence in [worship](Worship "Worship") and for him to hear
petitions lifted up in [prayer](Prayer "Prayer"). An entire prayer
can be designated as an 'invocation' or prayers may contain
invocations. Invocations are found throughout Scripture, a well
known invocation is the opening lines of the
[Lord's Prayer](Lord's_Prayer "Lord's Prayer") which says, 'Our
Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name..." (Mt. 6:9)

## Examples of Biblical Invocations

-   Psalm 103:1 - Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within
    me, bless his holy name.

-   Matthew 28:19 - Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,
    baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
    the Holy Ghost.
