***Ipsissima Vox*** is a Latin expression meaning "the very voice",
and describes the view that the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") Gospel-accounts
capture the concepts that [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") expressed, but not
exact words. *Ipsissima Vox* is contrasted with *Ispissima Verba*,
meaning "the very words".

## Arguments for *Ipsissima Vox*

1.  Jesus probably spoke mostly Aramaic, so most of what we have
    recorded in the gospels is already a translation.
2.  Jesus probably spent hours teaching, yet most of the didactic
    passages in the gospels take mere minutes to read.
3.  The gospel writers do not agree word-for-word in many parallel
    passages, but rather thought-for-thought.

## Arguments against *Ipsissima Vox*

1.  It opens the door for doubt in the doctrines of the inerrancy,
    sufficiency, and clarity of Scripture.
2.  It questions the ability of the Holy Spirit to enable the
    gospel writers to recall the words of Jesus.
3.  It fails to account for Luke's assertion in Luke 1:4 ("...that
    you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught."
    ESV) and Jesus' claim in John 14:26 ("But the Helper, the Holy
    Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all
    things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you."
    ESV)
