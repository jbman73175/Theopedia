**Irenaeus** (ca. 125-202) was bishop of Lugdunum in Gaul, which is
now Lyons, France. Irenaeus was born in Smyrna in Asia Minor, where
he studied under bishop [Polycarp](Polycarp "Polycarp"), who in
turn had been a disciple of the
[Apostle John](Apostle_John "Apostle John"). Leaving Asia Minor for
Rome he joined the school of
[Justin Martyr](Justin_Martyr "Justin Martyr") before being made
bishop of Lyons in Southern Gaul in about 178 AD.

Irenaeus is primarily noted for his refutation of early
[Gnosticism](Gnosticism "Gnosticism"). To this end he wrote his
major work *Against Heresies*, in which also sought to expound and
defend the orthodox Christian faith. A shorter later work is his
*Proof of the Apostolic Preaching*, a brief summary of Christian
teaching, largely concerned with Christ as the fulfillment of Old
Testament prophecy.

## Life of Irenaeus

### Early Years/Life

The facts about the life of Irenaeus are not
extremely clear or plentiful. We do know that he was born somewhere
in Asia Minor—probably in Smyrna, as it is written that he studied
under Polycarp of Smyrna in his youth. At some point before 177
Irenaeus moved to the area of Lugdunum (Lyons) in the area of Gaul.
It is known that Irenaeus was there at that time because in 177 AD
Marcus Aurelius authorized a mass slaughtering of the Christians in
Lyons.^[[1]](#note-0)^ At the time of this severe persecution of
177 AD Irenaeus was carrying a letter concerning Montanism from
Gaul to the church at Rome. Thus he escaped the ending of his life
for Christ by martyrdom as did his fellow Christians of Lyons. Upon
returning to Lyons Irenaeus was made bishop of Lyons, circa 178 AD.
He would remain in this position, being an avid writer against
heresies that were becoming wide spread in the church. Specifically
Irenaeus wrote against Gnosticism and Marcionism—both heresies that
had cropped up in many places of the empire, influencing and
leading astray many individuals.

### Death

Irenaeus died around the year 200 AD. There is a later
tradition of Irenaeus being martyred under Septimus Severus. Jerome
in one passage called Irenaeus a martyr, but no other early author
gave that title to Irenaeus.^[[2]](#note-1)^ The next time that
Irenaeus' death was mentioned was in the end of the 6th century in
writing by Gregory of Tours. This tradition was followed by
martyrologists thereafter. This tradition cannot be supported by
evidence that is available from early sources and it has been
generally rejected by the scholarly community.^[[3]](#note-2)^

## Writings of Irenaeus

During the second century many Christians sought to refute the
various doctrines that they saw as a threat to Christianity.
Eusebius records that Justin wrote *Against All Heresies* and
*Against Marcion*, and Theophilus of Antioch wrote
*Against Marcion* and *Against Hermogenes*. All of these writings
have been lost except for the record that we have of them in
Eusebius. Thus, the earliest heresiologist whose works we have is
Irenaeus of Lyons.

In the writings of the early church we have two documents extant
from Irenaeus—*Adversus haereses*, also titled
*Denunciation and Refutation of the So-called Gnosis*, and another
work entitled *Demonstration of Apostolic Preaching*. There is
account according to scholars of many more works from the pen of
Irenaeus which have been lost.^[[4]](#note-3)^ The
*Adversus Haereses* seeks to defend the postion of the Christians
in the whole of the world against the incursion of the Valentian
heresy. Irenaeus sought to dispel the myths and structure of
Valentians' Gnosticism, such as the complex structure of aeons or
the split between the creator God, the supreme God, and other gods.
He did this by basically expounding the doctrine of the Gnostics,
especially Valentinus' disciples and followers. Upon reading the
five books of *Adversus Heraesus* one will see that Irenaeus is
more focused on quoting Gnosticism as understood by this specific
school of thought and applying this to all of the heresy that was
in the larger vein of Gnosticism. As Irenaeus wrote himself, "It is
not necessary to drink up the ocean in order to learn that its
water is salty".^[[5]](#note-4)^

Since the discovery of the library of Nag Hammadi it has become
clear though, that Irenaeus was dealing with individuals who were
followers of Valentinus, not necessarily the exact doctrines of
Valentinius himself.^[[6]](#note-5)^ It seems that Valentinus had a
more moderated Gnostic understanding of God, not placing the Aeons
on the same level of authority as actual individual gods as did the
Gnosticism described in the works of Irenaeus.^[[7]](#note-6)^

The *Demonstration of Apostolic Preaching*, commonly referred to as
the *Epidexis*, was written for the purpose of strengthening the
faith of those who were already believers. In this work one sees
Irenaeus filling his pastoral and leadership role as a bishop of
the church in Lyons. Only an Armenian version has been preserved of
this text.

## Scholarly Critiques of Irenaeus' Writings

**Debate Over Originality of Writings** One classic debate over
Irenaeus' writngs was framed by Friedrich Loofs. In the early 20th
century Loofs suggested that Theophilus of Antioch was the source
of Irenaeus' writings, not Irenaeus himself.^[[8]](#note-7)^ F.R.M.
Hitchcock, in his article
"*Loof's Theory of Theophilus of Antioch as a source of Irenaeus*"^[[9]](#note-8)^
has shown some of the weaknesses of Loofs' study. He acknowledges
that some writings from a different context are apparent at some
points of Irenaeus' work but that this does not prove Loofs theory.
An example is in *Adversus haereses* 3. 22. 1, where Irenaeus makes
use of an anti-Ebionite argument that proves that Christ was born
of a virgin in order to argue against the Gnostics that Christ had
a human origin. There have been a slew of other academics who have
taken positions on both sides of the issue, with the general
appearance of the unity and validity of Irenaeus' work being
favored.^[[10]](#note-9)^

**Uses of the Writings of Irenaeus** Irenaeus' writings, as have
many other church fathers, have been used by a variety of scholars
to support a myriad of contemporary and historical heretical
positions. One particular theological position that has been skewed
is Irenaeus' doctrine of recapitulation. M.C. Steenberg has pressed
the concept of the recapitulation of Christ into a Roman Catholic
Mariology. Arguing against the possibility that Irenaeus is driven
primarily by aesthetic concerns, the author posits a reading of
Irenaeus that finds in Mary's person an integral and essential
component of a theologically coherent system of personal and social
recapitulation.^[[11]](#note-10)^ This style of tainting the works
of the church fathers is both unworthy scholarship and dangerous to
the uninformed reader.

## Analysis of Works

The most prominent feature of Irenaeus’ work his organic and
eschatological view of redemptive history. Opposed to the various
Gnostic heresies of the early church, which either ignored the Old
Testament or invented strange teachings of Aeons and the like,
Irenaeus viewed the whole of Scripture as a testament to the
incarnational Son of God, who is the eschatological event of the
cosmos. He is referred to often as containing a biblical theology
in his writings.^[[12]](#note-11)^ Irenaeus displayed this doctrine
in an organic view of revelation and the history of redemption, his
view of the incarnation of God in Jesus, the unity of the Bible,
and the Recapitulation of all things in Christ Jesus our Lord.

### Unity of the Bible and Unity of God

Irenaeus viewed the
Scriptures as organically connected from the Garden of Eden to the
summing up of all things. He understood that the organic feature of
revelation is an unfolding drama that leads to the eschatological
person and work of Christ. He states, in reference to the first
advent, “the advent of the Son of God took place in these last
times, that is, in the end, rather than in the beginning [of the
world]; and unfold what is contained in the Scriptures concerning
the end.”^[[13]](#note-12)^ This “unfolding” is the organic process
of revelation, which culminates in the appearance of the Son. These
revelations, while pointing to Christ, are indicative of the
eschatological nature of revelation, and they invite humanity to
participate with God in the eschaton. Thus, Irenaeus states that
God “called him [humanity] upwards from lesser things to those
greater ones which are in His own presence.”^[[14]](#note-13)^ For
him, the greatest doctrine is the eschatological presence of God,
and his drawing all things back to himself. Irenaeus likens
humanity to a child growing from the womb or a stalk of corn
growing from the ground. It is here that one can see then Irenaeus
focusing on the essential unity of God. As Irenaeus continues, “But
it is one and the same Creator who both fashioned the womb and
created the sun; and one and the same Lord who both reared the
stalk of corn, increased and multiplied the wheat, and prepared the
barn. ” ^[[15]](#note-14)^

### Recapitulation

Irenaeus followed Pauline theology in utilizing
the first and second Adam theme found within the Apostle Paul’s
writing to the Corinthians and Romans.^[[16]](#note-15)^ Irenaeus
believed that humanity was represented federally and covenantally
in Adam, and that the Garden of Eden was eschatologically alluding
to the reality of the second Adam. Irenaeus explains, “that as in
Adam we do all die, as being of an animal nature, in Christ we may
all live, as being spiritual, not laying aside God's handiwork, but
the lusts of the flesh, and receiving the Holy
Spirit.”^[[17]](#note-16)^ When Adam fell in the Garden, humanity
fell with him, and the only redemption is based upon the work of
the eschatological Adam, that being Jesus Christ. Therefore, for
Irenaeus the protological Adam was indicative of the eschatological
Adam. The eschatological focus within redemptive history displays
Irenaeus’ understanding of the nature of revelation and the
culmination of it in Christ Jesus.

Irenaeus’ understanding of salvation is revealed in light of his
biblical theology, especially within his doctrine of
recapitulation. He believed that as the culmination of redemptive
history, the incarnate Son of God recovered what was lost in the
first Adam. Some theologians erroneously declare that Irenaeus is
articulating a view of universalism in his doctrine of
recapitulation.^[[18]](#note-17)^ However, Irenaeus held
recapitulation to be the “summing up” of all history and humanity
in Christ Jesus as the conclusion of the drama of
redemption.^[[19]](#note-18)^ Furthermore, his belief is that in
Christ, the saved are justified through his eschatological work as
he is “both waging war against our enemy, and crushing him who had
at the beginning led us captives in Adam, and trampled upon his
head.” ^[[20]](#note-19)^ Thus he draws a parallel with Christ and
the promised seed of Adam and Eve in the book of Genesis.
Therefore, the summing up of all things is the fulfilling victory
of Christ, the reverse of the curse, and the salvation for those
who are covenantally in Christ as opposed to Adam. This
understanding of the soteriological and eschatological elements
within redemptive history was Irenaeus’ evangelical, apologetical,
and theological emphasis. Irenaeus used this doctrinal
understanding within his ministry to spread the gospel and to edify
and defend the early church.

## Conclusion

Irenaeus is a testimony of the redemptive-historical paradigm
unfolding in the teaching of the church from the first centuries of
Christian history. The recapitulation of the saved in Christ is a
critical link that Irenaeus uses to show the unity of the Bible,
the organic nature of revelation and the history of redemption, the
incarnation of God in Christ Jesus, and the unity of God. The
Biblical-Theological approach that Irenaeus used allowed him to be
a bastion of truth against the Gnostic heresies that were so
pervasive at his time. May he serve as an example to Christians
today, to seek to find the eschatological Christ in the
protological Adam, indeed the eschatological Gospel in all of
revelation, so that we too may be guarded from straying from the
path of the true Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord.
