**Irresistible Grace** (or **efficacious grace**) is a
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") in Christian
[theology](Theology "Theology") particularly associated with
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") which teaches that the saving
[grace](Grace "Grace") of [God](God "God") is effectually applied
to those whom he has determined to save (the
[elect](Predestination "Predestination")), whereby in God's timing,
he overcomes their resistance to the call of the
[gospel](Gospel "Gospel") and irresistibly brings them to a saving
[faith](Faith "Faith") in [Christ](Jesus "Jesus").

## The doctrine

Those who obtain the new birth do so, not because they wanted to
obtain it, but because of the sovereign discriminating grace of
God. That is, men are overcome by grace, not finally because their
consciences were more tender or their faith more tenacious than
that of other men. Rather, the willingness and ability to do God's
will are evidence of God's own faithfulness to save men from the
power and the penalty of [sin](Sin "Sin"), and since man is so
corrupt that he will not decide and cannot be wooed to follow after
God, sovereign efficacious grace is required to
[convert](Conversion "Conversion") him. This is done by the
[regeneration](Regeneration "Regeneration") of the Holy Spirit
whereby a fallen man who has heard the gospel is made willing and
necessarily turns to Christ in God-given faith.

### Biblical evidence for the doctrine

The sixth chapter of the
[Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") contains three
quotations from [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") that summarize the view that
no one can obey God unless God first regenerates the heart (all
quotes from the
[ESV](English_Standard_Version "English Standard Version")):

-   John 6:37, 39: "All that the Father gives me will come to
    me.... And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose
    nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last
    day."
-   John 6:44-45: "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent
    me draws him.... Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father
    comes to me."
-   John 6:65: "[N]o one can come to me unless it is granted him by
    the Father."

And the statement of [Paul](Paul "Paul") is said to confirm that
those whom God effectually calls necessarily come to full
salvation: "Those whom [God] predestined he also called, and those
whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he
also glorified" (Romans 8:28, 30).

The doctrine is inexorably bound up with the biblical view of man's
[inability](Total_depravity "Total depravity") to respond to God
and the extent of God's
[common grace](Common_grace "Common grace"). As
[Charles Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge") says, "The
[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") and
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism") doctrine is
true, if the other parts of their doctrinal system are true; and it
is false if that system be erroneous. If the
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") concerning the natural state of man
since the fall, and the sovereignty of God in election, be
Scriptural, then it is certain that sufficient grace does not
become efficacious from the cooperation of the human will"
(3.14.4). Thus the passages discussing those doctrines are also
relevant here.

### History of the doctrine

The doctrine is one of the so-called
"[five points of Calvinism](Calvinism#Salvation_.28Five_Points_of_Calvinism.29 "Calvinism")"
that were defined at the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort") (1618) during the
controversy with the [Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") party,
which objected to the general predestinarian scheme of the
[Belgic Confession of Faith](Belgic_Confession_of_Faith "Belgic Confession of Faith").
The doctrine is most often discussed in comparisons with other
salvific schemes and their respective doctrines about the
[grace](Grace "Grace") of God and the state of mankind after
[the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall").

### Objections to the doctrine

[Arminians](Arminianism "Arminianism"), notably Wesleyans, reject
the doctrine of irresistible grace just as they reject the doctrine
of
[unconditional election](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election").
Instead, they believe that God gives
[Resistible prevenient grace](Resistible_prevenient_grace "Resistible prevenient grace")
overcoming the effects of the fall, thus leaving each individual at
liberty to choose to follow God's call or not. In this view, (1)
after God's prevenient grace is given, the will of man, which was
formerly adverse to God and unable to obey, can now choose to obey;
and (2) although God's grace is a powerful initial move in
salvation, ultimately it can be resisted and rejected.
