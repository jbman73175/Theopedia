### 5-11

But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our
iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,
and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone
astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD has
laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was
afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to
the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
so he opened not his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken
away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off
out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my
people? And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man
in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no
deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him;
he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering for sin,
he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of
the LORD shall prosper in his hand. Out of the anguish of his soul
he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous
one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall
bear their iniquities.
