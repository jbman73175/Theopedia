**Islam** is the second-largest religion in the world, originated
by Muhammad in the 7th century A.D. The nearly 1.5 billion
adherents consider Muhammad to be the last prophet from God
(Allah), and his actions, and teachings, particularly as written in
the Qur'an and interpreted in the Sunnah and Hadith, to be
authoritative. The root of the term *Islam* is "al-silm" which
means "submission" or "surrender." The largest concentration of
Muslims live in the [10/40 window](10/40_window "10/40 window").

    eliminate inequality.
