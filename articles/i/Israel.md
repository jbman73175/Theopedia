## Israel the man

The name *Israel* means "he struggles with God"; this is both
descriptive of the circumstances in which Jacob received his new
name (Gen. 32:22-32) and prophetic of his descendants' struggles
against the Lord. Jacob was the grandson of
[Abraham](Abraham "Abraham") and the last of the
[patriarchs](index.php?title=Patriarch&action=edit&redlink=1 "Patriarch (page does not exist)").

## Israel the people

The Israelites were led, by [Moses](Moses "Moses") under
[God](God "God"), out of slavery in Egypt.
[Joshua](Joshua "Joshua"), Moses' successor, led them into freedom,
peace and prosperity in Canaan, the promised land. For the first
part of their history, they were ruled by judges who were raised up
by God as saviors from the oppressive nations around. Eventually,
the people rejected God as king and demanded their own king.

The Israelites worshiped God at the [temple](Temple "Temple") in
Jerusalem, where the
[priesthood](index.php?title=Priesthood&action=edit&redlink=1 "Priesthood (page does not exist)")
offered sacrifices and adjudicated in some medical matters. From
time to time, God sent [prophets](Prophet "Prophet") to warn of
judgment and remind of [repentance](Repentance "Repentance"); in
later times, these prophets also looked forward to the coming
[Messiah](Messiah "Messiah") and his reign of righteousness and
justice.

## Israel the kingdom

Eventually, the people of Israel rejected God as their king and
demanded to have a king "like all the nations" (1 Sam. 8:5).
Despite God's warning of tyrannical rulers, the people refuse to
listen and persist in their demand; the Lord therefore permits
Samuel to appoint a king for them. Saul, David and Solomon rule
over Israel. Saul's reign initially showed promise but degenerates
rapidly; David's reign is one of triumph and expansion; Solomon's
reign is peaceful and prosperous.

After Solomon, civil war splits the kingdom into the two kingdoms
Judah and Israel (1 Kings 12). The kingdom retaining the name
Israel was the northern one, based at first in Shechem, then
Tirzah, and finally Samaria. The kingdom's leadership went from bad
to worse, and was finally over-run by the Assyrians in judgment on
the people and their kings.

## Israel the Messiah

One of the major aims of Matthew's Gospel account is to show how
Jesus takes upon himself the story of Israel. The structure of
Matthew leads from [Genesis](Genesis "Genesis"):
[creation](Creation "Creation") and patriarchs (Matthew 1) to the
exile of the people and the kingdom, which is seen in the
[cross](index.php?title=Cross&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cross (page does not exist)").
Along the way, we see Jesus as the Wisdom of God, Jesus as God's
chosen leader, and as King. As Peter Leithart put it, "Jesus' life,
as Irenaeus saw, recapitulates the history of Israel, as Jesus
relives the story and does it right this time around."
[[1]](http://www.leithart.com/archives/001219.php) Jesus takes upon
himself Israel's sad and sorry tale of rebellion and gives her a
story of triumph, life and hope.

## Israel the Church

[Paul](Paul "Paul") gives strong hints of an identification of the
[Church](Church "Church") with Israel when he writes in
[Romans](Epistle_to_the_Romans "Epistle to the Romans") saying,
"not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel", and goes
on to explain that it is not the natural children but the children
of promise who are Abraham's offspring. Furthermore, the Church is
referred to, in the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"),
using imagery and language which was used of Israel by the
prophets. For instance, Israel is sometimes called the son of God â€”
the Church is spoken of in terms of sonship (Gal. 3:6-4:7). Also,
the relationship between God and Israel is sometimes likened to a
marriage (Hosea); but the great multitude of John's vision plainly
has the Church in view when they cry, "for the marriage of the Lamb
has come, and his Bride has made herself ready."
