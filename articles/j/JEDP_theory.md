The **JEDP theory** seeks to understand the authorship of the
[Pentateuch](Pentateuch "Pentateuch") in light of the Documentary
Hypothesis. This view believes that the Pentateuch represents the
conflation of four different sources rather than the work of
primarily one author, traditionally Moses. The results of
[Source Criticism](Biblical_criticism "Biblical criticism") first
proposed two authors (or sources) for the Pentateuch supposedly
distinguishable by the use of the terms *Yahweh* and *Elohim*. Two
additional sources were later proposed as P for Priestly, and D for
Deuteronomic resulting in the JEDP theory of authorship, most
notably associated with German scholar Julius Wellhausen
(1844-1918).

JEDP are initials representing the four hypothetical sources as
follows:

-   **J**awist (or Yahwist, from Yahweh) - describes God as
    *Yahweh*, starting in Gen 2:4, it includes much of
    [Genesis](Genesis "Genesis") and parts of [Exodus](Exodus "Exodus")
    and [Numbers](Book_of_Numbers "Book of Numbers"). It is dated
    around 850 B.C.
-   **E**lohist (from Elohim) - primarily describes God as *El* or
    *Elohim*. Starting with Gen 15, it covers material similar to "J".
    It is dated around 750 B.C. (J and E are said to be difficult to
    distinguish).
-   **D**euteronomy - a different source (or author) is associated
    with [Deuteronomy](Deuteronomy "Deuteronomy") alone, and is usually
    dated around 621 B.C.
-   **P**riestly - this encompasses writings scattered from Gen 1
    through the notice of Moses' death at the end of Deuteronomy. It is
    supposedly dated around 500 B.C.

Traditionally, [Moses](Moses "Moses") is viewed as the
[author of the Pentateuch](Mosaic_authorship_of_the_Pentateuch "Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch"),
and this has caused proponents of the JEDP theory to question: what
role did Moses play? Some have suggested that his role was minimal,
with the majority of the Pentateuch having been written after his
death. On the other hand, it has been put forth that Moses
developed the core of the Pentateuch, or in other words, the basis
for which all other material would follow. There are examples in
the Pentateuch of other known sources, for instance, "the Book of
the Wars of the LORD" (Num 21:14) that may have been used. So
although a different writing style or varying language-use may be
found, scholars still believe that Moses composed the more
essential and theological portions of the Pentateuch.
