J. C. Philpot
**Joseph Charles Philpot** (1802 – 1869) was known as “The
Seceder”. He resigned from the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England") in 1835
and became a
[Strict & Particular Baptist](Strict_&_Particular_Baptist "Strict & Particular Baptist").
While with the Church of England he was a Fellow of Worchester
College, Oxford. After becoming a Strict and Particular Baptist he
became the Editor of the *Gospel Standard* magazine and served in
that capacity for twenty years.

Educated at Oxford University, he was elected a fellow of Worcester
College, and appeared to have a brilliant scholastic career before
him. But he was brought into solemn concern spiritually and the
Lord led him into the ministry. He first preached in the
Established Church at Stadhampton (Oxfordshire). In 1835, however,
he was constrained, for the truth's sake, to sever his connection
with the Church of England and to resign his curacy and his
fellowship. The letter to the provost stating his reasons was
published and went into several editions.

The same year, he was baptized by John Warburton at Allington
(Wilts). The rest of his life was spent ministering among the
Strict Baptists. For 26 years, he held a joint pastorate at
Stamford (Lines) and Oakham (Rutland). In addition for over twenty
years, he was editor of "The Gospel Standard", where many of his
sermons first appeared.

"My desire is to exalt the grace of God; to proclaim salvation
alone through Jesus Christ; to declare the sinfulness, helplessness
and hopelessness of man in a state of nature; to describe the
living experience of the children of God in their trials,
temptations, sorrows, consolations and blessings." - J. C. Philpot
