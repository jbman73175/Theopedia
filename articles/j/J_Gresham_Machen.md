[![Machen.jpg](images/a/ab/Machen.jpg)](http://www.theopedia.com/File:Machen.jpg)
**John Gresham Machen** (1881-1937) was an influential American
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") theologian in the early
20th century. He was the Professor of New Testament at Princeton
Seminary between 1915 and 1929, and led a conservative revolt
against modernist theology at Princeton and formed Westminster
Seminary as a more orthodox alternative. This split was
irreconcilable, and Machen led others to form the
[Orthodox Presbyterian Church](Orthodox_Presbyterian_Church "Orthodox Presbyterian Church").

Machen is considered to be the last of the great
*Princeton Theologians* who had, since the formation of the college
in the early 19th century, developed Princeton Theology - a
conservative and [Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") form of
[Evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") Christianity.
Although Machen can be compared to the great
*Princeton Theologians*
([Archibald Alexander](Archibald_Alexander "Archibald Alexander"),
[Charles Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge"),
[A. A. Hodge](A._A._Hodge "A. A. Hodge") and
[B. B. Warfield](B._B._Warfield "B. B. Warfield")) he was neither a
lecturer in theology (he was a New Testament scholar) nor did he
ever become the seminary's principal.

Machen's influence can still be felt today through the existence of
both institutions that he founded - Westminster Seminary and the
Orthodox Presbyterian Church.

## Early Life

Machen was born on July 28, 1881 in Baltimore to Arthur Webster
Machen and Mary Jones Gresham. Arthur, a Baltimore Lawyer, was 45
and Mary was 24 when they married. While Arthur was an
[Episcopalian](Episcopalian "Episcopalian"), Mary was a
Presbyterian, and taught her son the Westminster Shorter Catechism
from an early age. The family attended Franklin Street Presbyterian
Church.

Machen's upbringing was considered to be privileged. He attended a
private college and received a classical education including Latin
and Greek. Although no records exist, it was probably
*The University School for Boys*. He was also taught the piano.

## Academic training

In 1898, the 17-year old Machen began studying at Johns Hopkins
University for his undergraduate degree, and performed sufficiently
well to gain a scholarship. He majored in classics and was a member
of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. Machen was a brilliant scholar and
in 1901 was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society after
graduation.

Despite having some indecisiveness about his future, in 1902 Machen
opted to study theology at Princeton Seminary, whilst
simultaneously studying a Master of Arts in Philosophy at Princeton
University.

He also pursued theological studies in Germany for a year in 1905.
In a letter to his father, he admitted being thrown into confusion
about his faith because of the liberalism taught by Professor
Wilhelm Herrmann. Although he had an enormous respect for Herrmann,
his time in Germany and his engagement with Modernist theologians
led him to reject the movement and embrace conservative Reformed
theology more firmly than before.

## Princeton 1906-1916

In 1906, Machen joined Princeton Seminary as an instructor in New
Testament after assurances he would not have to sign a statement of
faith. Among his Princeton influences were Francis Patton, who had
been the prosecutor in a nineteenth century heresy trial, and
[B. B. Warfield](B._B._Warfield "B. B. Warfield"), whom he
described as the greatest man he had ever met. Warfield maintained
that correct doctrine was the primary means by which Christians
influenced the surrounding culture and he emphasised a high view of
scripture and the defence of supernaturalism. It appears that under
their influence Machen resolved his crisis of faith. In 1914, he
was ordained and the next year he became the Assistant Professor of
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament").

## World War One

Machen did not serve "conventionally" during World War I, but
instead went to France with the YMCA to do volunteer work near and
at the front. Though not a combatant, he witnessed first-hand the
devastations of modern warfare.

## Princeton 1918-1926

After returning from Europe, Machen continued his work as a New
Testament scholar at Princeton. During this period he gained a
reputation as one of the few true scholars who was able to debate
the growing prevalance of Modernist theology whilst maintaining an
evangelical stance.

*The Origin of Paul's Religion* (1921) is perhaps Machen's best
known scholarly work. This book was a successful attempt at
critiquing the Modernist belief that Paul's religion was based
mainly upon Greek philosophy and was entirely different to the
religion of Jesus.

*Christianity and Liberalism* (1923) is another of Machen's books
that critiqued theological modernism. The book compared
conservative and protestant Christianity to the rising popularity
of Modernist (or "Liberal") theology. He concluded that "the chief
modern rival of Christianity is Liberalism".

These books, along with a number of others, placed Machen firmly in
one theological camp within the Presbyterian Church. His work
throughout the 1920s was divided between his time at Princeton and
his political work with evangelical Presbyterians.

Despite his conservative theological beliefs, Machen was never able
to fully embrace popularist
[fundamentalism](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") either. His
refusal to accept
[premillennialism](Premillennialism "Premillennialism") and other
aspects of Fundamentalist belief was based upon his belief that
Reformed Theology was the most biblical form of Christian belief -
a theology that was generally missing from Fundamentalism at the
time. Moreover, Machen's scholarly work and ability to engage with
modernist theology was at odds with Fundamentalism's
anti-intellectual attitude.

Indeed in a letter to the board of trustees of Bryan Memorial
University refusing their offer to make him president Machen
wrote:

> I never call myself a "Fundamentalist." There is indeed, no
> inherent objection to the term; and if the disjunction is between
> "Fundamentalism" and "Modernism," then I am willing to call myself
> a Fundamentalist of the most pronounced type. But after all, what I
> prefer to call myself is not a "Fundamentalist" but a
> "Calvinist"—that is, an adherent of the Reformed Faith. As such I
> regard myself as standing in the great central current of the
> Church's life—the current which flows down from the Word of God
> through Augustine and Calvin, and which has found noteworthy
> expression in America in the great tradition represented by Charles
> Hodge and Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield and the other
> representatives of the "Princeton School."

## Controversies

Between 1924 and 1925, relations among the Princeton faculty
deteriorated when *The Presbyterian* questioned if there were two
different parties on the faculty. In response Machen remarked that
his differences with Charles Eerdman related to the importance they
attributed to [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine"). He noted that
Eerdman was tolerant of those in doctrinal error. Eerdman wrote
privately ‘he
([Dwight L. Moody](Dwight_L._Moody "Dwight L. Moody")) knew that
controversialists do not usually win followers for Christ.’

## Westminster

The 1929 General Assembly voted to reorganise Princeton Seminary
and appointed two of the Auburn Affirmation signatories as
trustees. The Auburn Affirmation was a response by liberals within
the Northern Presbytery Church that condemned the General
Assembly's response to the contoversy arising out of Harry Emerson
Fosdick's sermon ‘Shall the Fundamentalists Win?’ in May 1922.
Machen and some colleagues withdrew and set up
[Westminster Theological Seminary](Westminster_Theological_Seminary "Westminster Theological Seminary")
to continue Old School theology.

## The Orthodox Presbyterian Church

In 1933, Machen became concerned about liberalism tolerated by
Presbyterians on the mission field and formed an independent
mission board. The next Presbyterian General Assembly reaffirmed
that independent mission boards were unconstitutional and gave the
associated clergy an ultimatum to sever their links. When Machen
and seven other clergy refused, they were suspended from the
Presbyterian ministry. The controversy divided Machen from many of
his fundamentalist friends including Clarence Macartney who dropped
away at the prospect of schism. Ultimately, Machen withdrew from
the Northern Presbyterian Church and formed the Orthodox
Presbyterian Church.

## Death

Much to the sadness of those who had been involved in the movements
that he had led, Machen died in 1937 at the relatively young age of
56. Some commentators (notably Stonehouse) point out that Machen's
"constitution" was not always strong, and that he was constantly
"burdened" with his responsibilities at the time.

Machen had decided to honor some speaking engagements he had in
North Dakota in December, 1936, but developed pleurisy in the
exceptionally cold weather there. After Christmas, he was
hospitalized for pneumonia and died on January 1, 1937. Just before
his death, he dictated a telegram to long-time friend and colleague
[John Murray](John_Murray "John Murray") -- the content of that
telegram reflected deeply his life-long faith: "I’m so thankful for
active obedience of Christ. No hope without it." .He is buried in
Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.
