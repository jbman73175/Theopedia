## Biographical sketch

The son of a clerk for the Great Western Railway, Packer won a
scholarship to Oxford University. It was as a student at Oxford
where he first met [C.S. Lewis](C.S._Lewis "C.S. Lewis") whose
teachings would become a major influence in his life. In a meeting
of the Oxford Inter-Collegiate Christian Union, Packer committed
his life to Christian service.

After briefly teaching Greek at Oak Hill College in London, Packer
entered Wycliffe Hall to study theology and was ordained in the
[Anglican](Anglican "Anglican") church. He became recognized as a
leader in the Evangelical movement in the Church of England. In
1978, he signed the
[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy](Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy "Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy"),
which affirmed the conservative position on
[inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy").

In 1979, Packer moved to Vancouver to take up a position with
Regent College. A prolific writer and frequent lecturer, Packer is
widely regarded in Protestant circles as one of the most important
theologians and church historians of the modern era. He is a
frequent contributor to and an executive editor of Christianity
Today. In recent years, he has become an outspoken proponent of the
ecumenical movement but believes that unity should not come at the
expense of [orthodox](Orthodox "Orthodox") Protestant doctrine.
Nonetheless, his advocacy of ecumenicism has brought sharp
criticism from some conservatives.

Packer served as general editor for the
[English Standard Version](English_Standard_Version "English Standard Version")
of the Bible (2001), an Evangelical revision of the
[Revised Standard Version](Revised_Standard_Version "Revised Standard Version")
of 1971.
