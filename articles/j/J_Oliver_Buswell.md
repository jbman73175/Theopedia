J. Oliver Buswell, Jr.
**J. Oliver Buswell, Jr.** (1895-1977) a Presbyterian theologian
and educator was President of
[Wheaton College](Wheaton_College "Wheaton College") from 1926 to
1940 and subsequently called to be Dean of Covenant Seminary, St.
Louis, Missouri, in 1956 where he served for 14 years until his
retirement in 1970. He is known for his writings, especially his
two volume
[Systematic Theology](Systematic_Theology "Systematic Theology"),
which remains widely used today.

In 1936 Dr. Buswell, together with Dr.
[J. Gresham Machen](J._Gresham_Machen "J. Gresham Machen"), Dr.
Harold S. Laird, and others, took his stand in opposition to the
forces of modernism in the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. He, with the
others mentioned, became the leaders of a new Presbyterian movement
uncompromisingly committed to a loyalty to God and the Scriptures.

"He helped form the Presbyterian Church of America in June of 1936,
which then changed its name to the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. In
the spring of 1937 he was a leader in the group which became the
Bible Presbyterian Church. A few years later a large portion of
this group constituted themselves as the Bible Presbyterian Church,
Columbus Synod. The name was later changed to The Evangelical
Presbyterian Church. In all of this trying and developing
experience of the church his leadership was evident and greatly
respected."

Buswell was a committed [Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") who held
to the Westminster Standards and
[Covenant Theology](Covenant_Theology "Covenant Theology"). He was
considered a [fundamentalist](Fundamentalism "Fundamentalism") in
the most evangelical sense of the word, specifically opposed to the
"modernism" of his day. He was also a
[Premillennialist](Premillennialism "Premillennialism") and
believed in a mid-tribulation [rapture](Rapture "Rapture"),
although not a
[dispensationalist](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism").
