Jacob is the grandson of [Abraham](Abraham "Abraham"), son of
[Isaac](index.php?title=Isaac&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isaac (page does not exist)")
and father of [Joseph](Joseph "Joseph") and his brothers. His name
was changed to Israel following his encounter with God (often
believed to be an appearance of the pre-incarnate
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")) His story is found in the book of Genesis.
Jacob (Israel) founded the Jewish nation.

Jacob is not your typical biblical hero. It is hard to approach his
life in the way we often do with other Biblical characters to
observed models of how to behave. It is fair to say that none of
the biblical heroes are without flaws, but Jacob had few positive
traits we can emulate. He was not a good husband. He was not a good
father.

The inclusion of the story of Jacob is an evidence for the Bible’s
truthfulness - it is hard to imagine this story being made up and
included as the founder of God's people. No other nation on earth
describes its founder in such unsavory terms.

The story of Jacob is also included in Scripture in such gory
detail to teach us a message--possibly one of the hardest messages
we come across in the whole of Scripture. Paul mentions Jacob as
follows: - Romans 9:13 ". . . when Rebekah had conceived children
by one man, our forefather Isaac, though they were not yet born and
had done nothing either good or bad—in order that God's purpose of
election might continue, not because of works but because of him
who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” As it
is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”

Jacob is thus a key example of
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination") through no merit
of his own. That such a man should be chosen by God and given an
unconditional promise should both humble us and encourage us.

Jacob’s first recorded words were: “Sell me your birthright now.”
(Genesis 25:31) These words show us what his character was like. He
stole his brothers birthright and entered into a competition with
his relative Laban to see who could cheat each other most
successfully. It was only on his return to face his brother Esau
and through his encounter with God that he was humbled. The latter
half of Jacob's life is a tragedy involving his sons who's jealousy
he appears to have done nothing to reduce. Jacob is praised in
Hebrews 11 for the way he passed on the blessing near his death.
