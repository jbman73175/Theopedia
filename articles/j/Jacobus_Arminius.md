**Jacobus Arminius**^[[1]](#note-0)^ (1560-1609), was a Dutch
[Reformed](Reformed_churches "Reformed churches") theologian and
professor of theology at the University of Leiden. He is most noted
for his departure from the Reformed theology of the
[Belgic Confession](Belgic_Confession "Belgic Confession")

## Life

Arminius was born Jacob Hermansen at Oudewater, Utrecht, on October
10, 1560. Taking a Latinized form of one's name was a custom of the
time for theology students. His father died while Jacob was an
infant, leaving his mother a widow with small children. A priest,
Theodorus Aemilius, adopted Jacob and sent him to school at
Utrecht. His mother was slain during the Spanish massacre of
Oudewater in 1575. About that year Arminius was sent to study
theology at the University of Leiden by the kindness of friends
(Rudophus Snellius).

Arminius remained at Leiden from 1576 to 1582. His teachers in
theology included Lambertus Danaeus, Johannes Drusius, Guillaume
Feuguereius, and Johann Kolmann. Kolmann believed and taught that
high [Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") made God both a tyrant and
an executioner. Under the influence of these men, Arminius studied
with success and had seeds planted that would begin to develop into
a theology that would later compete with the dominant Reformed
theology of [John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"). Arminius
began studying under Theodore Beza at Geneva in 1582. He was called
to pastor at Amsterdam and was ordained in 1588. He was reputed to
be a good preacher and faithful pastor. In 1590 he married Lijsbet
Reael.

## Theology

Arminius is best known as the founder of the anti-Calvinistic
school in Protestant theology that bears his name --
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"). In attempting to defend
Calvinistic [predestination](Predestination "Predestination")
against the onslaughts of Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert, Arminius
began to doubt and changed his own view. He became a professor of
theology at Leiden (sometimes Leyden) in 1603 and died there on
October 19, 1609. The theology of Arminianism was not fully
developed during Arminius' time, but was systematized after his
death and formalized in the
*[Five Articles of Remonstrance](Five_Articles_of_Remonstrance "Five Articles of Remonstrance")*
in 1610. The works of Arminius (in Latin) were published at Leiden
in 1629, and at Frankfort in 1631 and 1635. After his death, at the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort") (1618-1619), his
teaching was condemned by the State church. Later, however,
Arminianism received official "toleration" by the State and has
since continued in various forms within Protestantism.

-   "The providence of God is subordinate to creation; and it is,
    therefore, necessary that it should not impinge against creation,
    which it would do, were it to inhibit or hinder the use of free
    will in man. . ." *The Works of James Arminius,* Vol. 2, p. 460.
-   "God decreed to save and damn certain particular persons. This
    decree has its foundation in the foreknowledge of God, by which he
    knew from all eternity those individuals who *would*, through his
    preventing [going before] grace, believe, and, through his
    subsequent grace *would* persevere by which foreknowledge, he
    likewise knew those who *would not believe and persevere*." -
    *The Works of James Arminius,* Vol 1, p 248, italics in original.
-   "Though we always and on all occasions make this grace to
    precede, to accompany and follow; and without which, we constantly
    assert, no good action whatever can be produced by man. Nay, we
    carry this principle so far as not to dare to attribute the power
    here described [free will] even to the nature of Adam himself,
    without the help of Divine Grace both infused and assisting."
