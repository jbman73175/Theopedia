**Perfection through trials**

God does not need to "test" us to know our hearts. When we go
through trials in life, it is a building up of the believer in
patience and as a work towards perfecting us in the image of our
Lord Jesus Christ.

In verse 5 there is a general call to all believers that lack
wisdom, to ask for it and in turn receive it from a generous God
who will not qualify the request. Key to this passage of scripture
is the word wisdom. In the original
[Greek](Koine_Greek "Koine Greek"), this word is sophia
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#4678](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=4678&version=nas)]*^)
and it speaks to the insight into the true nature of things rather
than just having an abundance of knowledge.

Wisdom is most important because if one wished to grow towards
being perfected, then it is essential that one can discern between
simple matters of this world, and spiritual matters that God is
speaking to us through the circumstances we find ourselves in. Not
paying your automobile insurance on time will result in a penalty.
This is not a spiritual testing, but the consequence of personal
irresponsibility in financial matters. If the insurance is
canceled, this is not God putting you through a spiritual trial. It
is however entirely possible that God may work on your heart for
you to grow in this area of life, as you should, but in and of
itself the consequences of our own deeds or misdeeds are not what
James is speaking of.

On the other hand, God does work through our lives and those around
us in mysterious ways that oftentimes seems to be matters beyond
anyone's control, as we are prodded towards spiritual maturity. A
good example of this is having to trust God and His word in going
through a difficult period of life.

James is implying with the use of the word wisdom (sophia) that in
this area of knowing the difference between the result of our
actions and of God's hand working in our lives is essential to
wisdom. It is in fact wisdom and what he is precisely speaking
about. Once a person is aware of God's will and nudging
spiritually, and able to separate material circumstance from
spiritual boot camp, he or she will be able to better cope with the
trial or trials that are ahead.

In verses 6 through 8, this point is further driven home as James
speaks of approaching the request for wisdom in faith and without
doubting. If you understand that it is certainly God's will for you
to be capable of knowing how to see the trials you are facing with
a spiritual perspective, the only place left for doubt is a person
who doubts God to begin with. This "double-mindedness" speaks to an
individual who is not sure if it is God or not working in their
lives. He states quite clearly that someone who displays this type
of attitude is "unstable in all his ways" using the metaphor of
wind blowing waves in the sea around, seemingly at random.
