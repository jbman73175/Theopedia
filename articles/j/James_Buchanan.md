**James Buchanan** (1804-1870), minister and theologian, was
ordained in the Church of Scotland in 1827. In 1828 he commenced a
very successful ministry at North Leith where he gained a great
reputation as an earnest and eloquent preacher of the Word of God.
In 1845 he was appointed to the Chair of Apologetics at New
College, Edinburgh, and in 1847 he succeeded Chalmers as Professor
of Systematic Theology. He retired in 1868 and died two years
later.

His two most notable works were
*The Office and Work of the Holy Spirit* and
*The Doctrine of Justification*.
