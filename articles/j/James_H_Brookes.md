Presbyterian Church in St. Louis, Missouri. The Brookes Bible
Institute of St. Louis was named in his honor.^[[1]](#note-0)^ Dr.
Brookes was a prolific writer, having authored more than 200
booklets and tracts. He was a well-known Bible teacher and the
editor of *The Truth*, a periodical, which served, along with
another journal, as the official organ of the
[premillennial](Premillennialism "Premillennialism") movement until
his death in 1897. Brookes, a
[dispensationalist](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism"), was
also a key leader in the famous
[Niagara Bible Conference](Niagara_Bible_Conference "Niagara Bible Conference").
Beginning in 1875, he was sought out as the keynote speaker and for
many years served as its president. One of his very influential
students was [C. I. Scofield](C._I._Scofield "C. I. Scofield"),
editor of the popular
