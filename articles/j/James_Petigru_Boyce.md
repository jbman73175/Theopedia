**James Petigru Boyce** (1827–1888) was a
[Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") theologian,
[Calvinist](Calvinist "Calvinist"), and seminary professor. Boyce
was educated at Brown University under Francis Wayland, whose
evangelical sermons contributed to Boyce’s conversion, and at
Princeton Theological Seminary under
[Charles Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge") who led Boyce to
appreciate Calvinistic theology. Boyce became a pastor, then a
university professor, and finally the founder and first president
of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, where he taught
theology from 1859 until his death in 1888. Throughout his ministry
Boyce insisted on the importance of theological education for all
ministers. In a preface, he described his
*Abstract of Systematic Theology*, published the year before his
death, as follows: "This volume is published the rather as a
practical text book, for the study of the system of doctrine taught
in the Word of God, than as a contribution to theological
science."
