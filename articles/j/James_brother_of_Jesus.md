This **James** is referred to as "the Lordâ€™s brother" in Matt.
13:55, Mark 6:3, Gal. 1:19, called simply "James" in Acts 12:17,
15:13, 21:18, and 1 Cor. 15:7, and is considered by most scholars
to be the author of the New Testament
[Epistle of James](Epistle_of_James "Epistle of James").

In A.D. 62, James the brother of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") and leader
of the Jerusalem community was executed. This was a great blow, for
James was a deeply dedicated figure whose obvious piety and prudent
leadership had commended the new faith to many over more than two
decades. His most striking testimony had been that commitment to
Jesus in no way required severance from Jewish roots. The
consistent Jewishness of James' theology is evident in the
[Epistle of James](Epistle_of_James "Epistle of James") that exists
in our New Testament. (Davidson, *The Birth of the Church*, p.
131)

### Josephus concerning James

"Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he
assembled the sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the
brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and
some others, [or, some of his companions]; and when he had formed
an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered
them to be stoned"

    provides the oldest archeological record of Jesus of Nazareth in
    connection with James and Joseph.
