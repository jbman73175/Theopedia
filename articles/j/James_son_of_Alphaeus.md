**James** the **son of Alphaeus** is one of the twelve apostles
listed in Matt. 10:3, Mark 3:18 & 15:40 (here called James the
Younger), Luke 6:15, and Acts 1:13. He is an obscure apostle,
mentioned only in lists of apostles and disciples. Not to be
confused with
[James, son of Zebedee](James,_son_of_Zebedee "James, son of Zebedee"),
he is sometimes thought to be the same as
[James, brother of Jesus](James,_brother_of_Jesus "James, brother of Jesus")
and author of the
[Epistle of James](Epistle_of_James "Epistle of James"), although
this is most likely not the case.
