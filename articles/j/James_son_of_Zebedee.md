**James**, son of Zebedee and the brother of [John](John "John"),
was executed by the order from Herod Agrippa between 41-44 AD. He
was put to death "with the sword". (c.f. Acts 12:1-24).

This James, the brother of John, is mentioned in Matt. 4:21; 10:2;
17:1; Mark 1:19, 29; 3:17; 10:35; 13:3; Luke 9:28; and Acts 1:13;
12:2. He is an important figure in the Gospels, less so in Acts due
to his early death as a martyr under Herod Agrippa I no later than
the spring of 44 CE (Acts 12:2). This early martyrdom argues
against identification of this James with the author of the
[Epistle of James](Epistle_of_James "Epistle of James").
