**Jaroslav Jan Pelikan** (1923 - 2006) was Sterling Professor of
History Emeritus at Yale University and was one of the world's
foremost scholars of the
[history of Christianity](Church_history "Church history") and
medieval intellectual history. Pelikan was the son of a Lutheran
minister who had emigrated from what is now Czechoslovakia and was
born in Akron, Ohio. He was a graduate of Concordia Theological
Seminary in St. Louis and received a doctorate from the University
of Chicago in 1946.

Pelikan authored more than 30 books. They include the monumental
five-volume series,
*The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine*
(1971-1989). He described it as what "the church of Jesus Christ
has believed, taught, and confessed on the basis of the word of
God" for 20 centuries. Evangelical historian
[Mark Noll](Mark_Noll "Mark Noll") called it "a history of
Christian doctrine on a scale no one has attempted before." For
most of his life, he was a member the Lutheran Church-Missouri
Synod. However, in his twilight years (1998), he and his wife
converted to
[Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy").

Pelikan tended to steer clear of modern religious controversies and
debates. "There ought to be somebody who speaks to the other 19
centuries," he said in a 1983 interview with the Christian Science
Monitor. "Not everybody should be caught in this moment. I'm filing
a minority report on behalf of the
past."[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/16/AR2006051601694.html)
Pelikan was also a former president of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences.
