The **jealousy of God** involes [God](God "God")'s jealousy for his
glory and for the faithfulness of his people.
[Erik Thoennes](Erik_Thoennes "Erik Thoennes") explains that both
are related, writing that "God is ultimately jealous for the
faithfulness of his people *because* he is jealous for his own
glory" (*Godly Jealousy*, p. 32, ephasis added). He goes on to say
that "God's desire for glory drives his constant
[revelation of himself](Revelation_of_God "Revelation of God") in
the lives of his people. He wants to be known, and recognized for
who he is, so that he will receive his deserved glory (p. 33).
