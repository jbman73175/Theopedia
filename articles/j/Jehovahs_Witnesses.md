**Jehovah's Witnesses** are a religion, founded in the late 1870s
by Charles Taze Russell, whose members believe it to be the
restoration of first-century Christianity. They are one of the
fastest-growing churches in the US, with an active membership of
more than one
million[[1]](http://www.ncccusa.org/news/050330yearbook.html), and
extremely active in proselytizing, with established congregations
in most parts of the world.

While Jehovah's Witnesses believe the Bible to be inspired, they
accept only the greatly flawed New World Translation as
authoritative, along with other publications from the Watchtower
Tract & Bible Society, which claims to be the "one and only
channel"^[[1]](#note-0)^ of truth from God, and that "it alone, in
all the earth, is directed by God's holy spirit or
force".^[[2]](#note-1)^

Jehovah's Witnesses believe Jesus to be a created being, not God
incarnate. Their early views had much in common with the
[Adventists](Seventh_Day_Adventism "Seventh Day Adventism"),
rejecting orthodox doctrines of the [trinity](Trinity "Trinity")
and [hell](Hell "Hell"), and focusing on the
[Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming"), initially believed
to have occurred invisibly in 1874, but later revised to 1914. They
believe salvation in heaven is limited to 144,000 "anointed ones",
but that followers can can escape annihilation on earth by good
works, particularly evangelism.

Jehovah's Witnesses are also known for refusing to observe holidays
or birthdays, voting, saluting the flag, working in the military,
accepting blood transfusions, or becoming involved in social,
religious, or political conflicts.
