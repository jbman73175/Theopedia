**Jeremiah Burroughs** (c. 1600 – 1646) was an English
Congregationalist and [Puritan](Puritan "Puritan") preacher.
Burroughs studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and was graduated
M.A. in 1624, but left the university because of non-conformity. He
was assistant to Edmund Calamy at Bury St. Edmunds, and in 1631
became rector of Tivetshall, Norfolk. He was suspended for
non-conformity in 1636 and soon afterward deprived, he went to
Rotterdam (1637) and became "teacher" of the English church there.
He returned to England in 1641 and served as preacher at Stepney
and Cripplegate, London. He was a member of the Westminster
Assembly and one of the few who opposed the Presbyterian majority.
While one of the most distinguished of the English Independents, he
was one of the most moderate, acting consistently in accordance
with the motto on his study door (in Latin and Greek): "Opinionum
varietas et opinantium unitas non sunt ασυστατα" ("Difference of
belief and unity of believers are not inconsistent"). His
publications were many, one of the most important being
*An Exposition with Practical Observations on the Prophecy of Hosea*
(4 vols., London, 1643-57),
