**Jerome Zanchius** (1516-1590), Italian
[Protestant Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation")
clergyman and educator, was born Jerome Zanchi in Alazano, the son
of a nobleman on the 2nd of February 1516.

His father died in the plague of 1528 and his mother died only
three years later. At age 15 he entered the monastery of the
Augustinian Order of Regular Canons where he studied Aristotle,
languages and divinity. He also attended the lectures on Romans
given by Peter Martyr Vermigli, the greatest of the Italian
Reformers.

In 1551, under growing persecution against the Reformation, he left
Italy via Geneva and eventually accepted the professorship of Old
Testament at the college of St. Thomas in Strasbourg where he began
to teach in 1553 and continued to give excellent instruction for
nearly 11 years. In 1563 he left the College and pastored the
Italian Protestant congregation in the Grisons in the city of
Chiavenna. Finally, in 1567 Prince Frederick III (1515-1576)
prevailed upon Zanchius to accept a divinity professorship in the
University of Heidelberg, joining Zacharias Ursinus (1534-1583). In
the year 1568 he entered on his new duties and in the same year
received a doctor's degree. He held this post for 9 years when, at
the death of Fredrick III, he chose to take the pastorate of the
church at Neustadt an der Haardt. He remained there until his death
on the 19th of November 1590, while on a visit to Heidelberg.

Zanchius was a voluminous writer whose works include,
*Confession of the Christian Religion* and
*Observation on the Divine Attributes*. He is perhaps best known
for his book *The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination*, which is
still in publication today.
