**Jerusalem** is the ancient city that became significant to the
Jewish people with its conquest by [David](David "David"), who
united the Israelite tribes, became king and made Jerusalem the
political and administrative seat of his kingdom around 1000 B.C.
The city's significance was increased when David's son,
[King Solomon](Solomon "Solomon"), constructed the
[Temple](Temple "Temple") there. The Temple was the religious
center for the people of Israel, who made the pilgrimage to the
Temple three times a year.

After Solomon's death, the monarchy was split, and Jerusalem
remained the capital of the southern kingdom of
[Judah](index.php?title=Judah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Judah (page does not exist)").
In the eighth century B.C., the Assyrians under Sennacherib
besieged the city. In 586 B.C. the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar
captured the city, destroyed the Temple and exiled many Jews to
Babylon. Fifty years later, when Babylon fell to the Persians, King
Cyrus allowed Jewish exiles to return to Jerusalem. The Temple was
rebuilt on the historic site, the city was resettled and resumed
its status as the spiritual capital of Judaism. With the conquest
of Alexander the Great in 333 B.C., Jerusalem came under
Hellenistic influence.

In the first century B.C., King Herod reconstructed and expanded
the Temple. Although the country was under Roman rule from around
60 B.C., the Roman capital was in Caesarea. About the time of
Christ's birth, Judea became a Roman province. In 66 A.D., a Jewish
revolt against Roman restrictions on Jewish expression culminated
in the Roman siege of Jerusalem. In 70, Titus led the Romans into
Jerusalem, burnt down the Temple and destroyed the city. A thousand
years of Jewish rule in Jerusalem came to an end.

## In early Christianity

For Christians, Jerusalem is central to the events of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"). According to the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"), many events in [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")'
childhood and adulthood took place in Jerusalem and it was in
Jerusalem that he was tried under
[Pontius Pilate](Pontius_Pilate "Pontius Pilate"), put to death on
the
[cross](index.php?title=Cross&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cross (page does not exist)"),
and [rose again](Resurrection "Resurrection") the third day.
