**Jesus Christ** is the originator and focus of the Christian faith
based on the teaching of the Holy [Bible](Bible "Bible"). He is the
eternal second person of the [Triune](Trinity "Trinity") God who
took on humanity at his [incarnation](Incarnation "Incarnation"),
being born of the virgin Mary. He is uniquely the God-man, both
fully God and fully man in his one person, who came to fully reveal
God and accomplish the [redemption](Redemption "Redemption") of
mankind through his sacrificial
[atoning death](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ") on the
cross. On the third day following his crucifixion, Jesus rose from
the dead by the power of the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") and now sits at the right
hand of [God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father"),
according to the Scriptures.

His incarnation, earthly ministry, death, and
[resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection") are specifically
recorded in the four Gospels of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"). The study of Jesus
Christ is called **Christology**.

## Jesus the Christ

The name 'Jesus' is derived from the Latin form of the
[Greek](Greek "Greek") *Iesous*, which in turn is the Greek
translation of the [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew") *Jeshua*, or *Joshua*,
meaning "Jehovah is salvation."

The title 'Christ', from the Greek *Christos*, is the equivalent of
the Hebrew *Messias*, meaning "anointed one." Thus, the term Christ
is a title rather than a proper name and identifies Jesus as the
anticipated Messiah of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament").

"To believe that 'Jesus is the Christ' is to believe that he is the
Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent of God,
that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be. This is to believe
the gospel, by the faith of which alone men can be brought unto
God. That Jesus is the Christ is the testimony of God, and the
faith of this constitutes a Christian (1 Corinthians 12:3; 1 John
5:1)." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Jesus' pre-existance

Scripture presents Jesus as the second person of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") who existed *prior to* his
incarnation. Christ was involved in the Creation (John 1:1-3) and
is denoted as having existed before all things were created (see
Col.1:16-17; cf. John 17:5).

*See main pages: [Pre-existence of Jesus](Pre-existence_of_Jesus "Pre-existence of Jesus"), [Eternal Sonship of Jesus](Eternal_Sonship_of_Jesus "Eternal Sonship of Jesus"), [Eternal generation of the Son](Eternal_generation_of_the_Son "Eternal generation of the Son"), [Deity of Jesus](Deity_of_Jesus "Deity of Jesus")*
## The Word became flesh

*And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John 1:14)*
Although Jesus pre-existed as the Son of God, Scripture teaches
that he took on flesh and was born in the likeness of men in human
form (Philippians 2:7-8; cf. 1 John 4:2-3). This has traditionally
been understood as his [incarnation](Incarnation "Incarnation").
Jesus was born of a virgin, a [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") well
attested in the NT and found deep in the beliefs of the
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers").

*See main pages: [Incarnation of the Son of God](Incarnation_of_the_Son_of_God "Incarnation of the Son of God"), [Virgin birth of Jesus](Virgin_birth_of_Jesus "Virgin birth of Jesus"), [Humanity of Jesus](Humanity_of_Jesus "Humanity of Jesus"), [Genealogy of Jesus](Genealogy_of_Jesus "Genealogy of Jesus")*
## Jesus' life and ministry

"When he was about thirty years of age" (Luke 3:23) Jesus was
baptized, signifying the beginning of his ministry. He was then
tempted by the [devil](Devil "Devil"), and remained obedient unlike
the disobedience of Israel in the midst of their temptations.
Throughout his ministry he performed many miracles, healing the
sick, raising the dead, and performing many "signs" (cf.
[Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John")). He told
parables, and the NT (especially the Gospels) are full of his
teachings. Furthermore, Jesus lived a sinless life, fulfilling the
law and completely obeying the will of God.

*See main pages: [Baptism of Jesus](Baptism_of_Jesus "Baptism of Jesus"), [Life of Jesus](Life_of_Jesus "Life of Jesus"), [Miracles of Jesus](Miracles_of_Jesus "Miracles of Jesus"), [Obedience of Jesus](index.php?title=Obedience_of_Jesus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Obedience of Jesus (page does not exist)"), [Parables of Jesus](Parables_of_Jesus "Parables of Jesus"), [Sinlessness of Jesus](Sinlessness_of_Jesus "Sinlessness of Jesus"), [Teachings of Jesus](Teachings_of_Jesus "Teachings of Jesus"), [Temptation of Jesus](Temptation_of_Jesus "Temptation of Jesus")*
## The person of Jesus

Jesus is both fully God and fully man. Furthermore, he has been
traditionally understood as Prophet, Priest, and King (his
"offices"). Scripture also presents him as the Suffering Servant
(Isaiah 53), and the Second Adam (Rom.5:12-21; 1 Cor.15:20-22). Who
Jesus was (his person) is closely linked to what he did (his
works).

*See main pages: [Deity of Jesus](Deity_of_Jesus "Deity of Jesus"), [Humanity of Jesus](Humanity_of_Jesus "Humanity of Jesus"), [Two natures of Jesus](Two_natures_of_Jesus "Two natures of Jesus"), [Communicatio idiomatum](Communicatio_idiomatum "Communicatio idiomatum"), [Offices of Jesus](Offices_of_Jesus "Offices of Jesus"), [Jewishness of Jesus](Jewishness_of_Jesus "Jewishness of Jesus"), [Jesus as the Suffering Servant](Jesus_as_the_Suffering_Servant "Jesus as the Suffering Servant"), [Jesus as the second Adam](Jesus_as_the_second_Adam "Jesus as the second Adam")*
## The culmination of Jesus' life

Jesus' life culminated in his substitutionary death, resurrection
and ascension. Scripture teaches that Jesus died, was buried, and
rose on the third day (1 Cor 15:3-4; cf. Acts 2:32). In this, he
revealed the glory he had with the Father before the world existed
(John 17:5), being exalted to the right hand of God and given the
name above all names (Phil 2:9).

*See main pages: [Atonement of Christ](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ"), [Resurrection of Jesus](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus"), [Ascension of Jesus](Ascension_of_Jesus "Ascension of Jesus")*
## Jesus' return

Jesus will return to judge both believers and unbelievers (see Matt
24-25; cf. 1 Thess). Known as the *parousia*, Christians call this
the Second Coming.

*See main pages: [Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming"), [Millennium](Millennium "Millennium")*
## Other issues in Christology

### Methods

Traditionally, Christology has been approached "from above" and
"from below." While these are not the only methods, they have
remained the current methods for doing theology.

*See main page: [Christological methods](index.php?title=Christological_methods&action=edit&redlink=1 "Christological methods (page does not exist)")*
### What did Jesus actually say and do?

Groups and organizations like the Jesus Seminar have questioned the
reliability of the [Gospels](Gospels "Gospels") and thus their
presentation of the biblical Jesus. Did the Jesus of scripture
really exist? If he did, what did he say and did he really perform
miracles? These are some of the questions involved in this ongoing
discussion.

*See main pages: [Historicity of Jesus](Historicity_of_Jesus "Historicity of Jesus") and [Jesus Seminar](Jesus_Seminar "Jesus Seminar")*
### Could Jesus have sinned?

Many have questioned whether or not Jesus was able to sin. Since
Jesus is God, those who say he could have sinned are criticized for
implying that God could sin. Those who deny that Jesus could have
sinned find critique in that this makes Jesus somehow less human,
and although he knew temptation, it was not similar the temptation
that the rest of humanity faces.

*See main page: [Impeccability of Jesus](Impeccability_of_Jesus "Impeccability of Jesus")*
### Old Testament Prophecy

The [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") is ripe with
prophecy that points to the Messiah, setting conditions in which
believers could identify the [Christ](Christ "Christ"), in addition
to His complete fulfillment of the Law. The fulfillment of the Law
is very important, as Christ had to be the "spotless Lamb" in order
to redeem humanity.

*See main pages: [Messianic prophecy](Messianic_prophecy "Messianic prophecy"), [Jesus and the Law](Jesus_and_the_Law "Jesus and the Law")*
