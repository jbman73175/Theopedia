The **Jesus Seminar** is a controversial research team of academic
New Testament scholars founded in 1985 by the late
[Robert Funk](Robert_Funk "Robert Funk") under the auspices of the
Westar Institute. It is a relatively new corporate venture that
attempts, by a process of discussion and voting, to arrive at an
answer to two questions: “What did Jesus *really* say?” and “What
did Jesus *really* do?” It is a continuation of the "quest for the
[Historical Jesus](Historical_Jesus "Historical Jesus")" movement
of the early 20th century.
[N.T. Wright](N._T._Wright "N. T. Wright") says, "People have been
looking for Jesus for a long time, but never quite like this."

Their conclusions differ greatly from what Christian denominations
have historically taught. They are also in major conflict with the
current beliefs of most present-day conservative
Christians.^[[1]](#note-RT)^

The initial two hundred scholars has now dwindled to about
seventy-four active members who meet periodically to debate newly
presented or recently-circulated papers.^[[2]](#note-LeaderU)^
Among its many recent publications, one stands out as a kind of
flagship: *The Five Gospels,* published late in 1993. It was the
book towards which all else was preliminary.^[[3]](#note-Wright)^

These scholars attempt to reconstruct the life of Jesus. They try
to answer who he was, what he did, what he said, and what his
sayings meant using all extant evidence and available tools. The
Seminar's approach, like that of Funk, is historical and critical,
with a strongly skeptical view of traditional Christian
belief.^[[1]](#note-RT)^

The Seminar has now completed many years of detailed and
painstaking work. Their reconstruction of Jesus is based on the
triple pillar of social anthropology, history, and textual
analysis. They use cross-cultural anthropological studies to set
the general background; narrow in on the history and society of
first-century Judea; and use textual analysis, anthropology and
historical data to focus on Jesus himself.^[[3]](#note-Wright)^

## The Five Gospels

This book takes its title from the traditional four
Gospels─Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John─with the addition of *Thomas*
because of its apparent similarity with some reconstructions of the
hypothetical source “Q” and the portrait of Jesus which the “Q”
source appears to support.

Some have questioned whether the Jesus proposed by
*The Five Gospels* constitutes, or offers, good news, i.e.,
“gospel,” at all. According to Wright, "the main thing this Jesus
has to offer...is the news that the fundamentalists are
wrong."^[[3]](#note-Wright)^

## Quotes

From Robert Funk at a keynote address in 1994 to the Jesus Seminar
Fellows:

-   "Jesus did not ask us to believe that his death was a blood
    sacrifice, that he was going to die for our sins. "
-   "Jesus did not ask us to believe that he was the messiah. He
    certainly never suggested that he was the second person of the
    Trinity. In fact, he rarely referred to himself at all. "
-   "Jesus did not call upon people to repent, or fast, or observe
    the sabbath. He did not threaten with hell or promise heaven. "
-   "Jesus did not ask us to believe that he would be raised from
    the dead. "
-   "Jesus did not ask us to believe that he was born of a virgin.
    "
-   "Jesus did not regard Scripture as infallible or even inspired.
    "

## Voting

Following each debate, colored beads have been used to "vote" on
the authenticity of Jesus' words and deeds. For example:

### Jesus' words

-   **Red** - Jesus undoubtedly said this or something very like
    it..
-   **Pink** - Jesus probably said something like this..
-   **Gray** - Jesus did not say this, but the ideas contained in
    it are close to his own.
-   **Black** - Jesus did not say this; it represents the
    perspective or content of a later or different tradition.

#### The results

"Their voting conclusions: Over 80% of the statements attributed to
Jesus in the Gospels are, by voting consensus, either gray or
black. This means that only 20% of Jesus' statements are likely to
have been spoken by Him. The other 80% are most assuredly, they
say, unlikely to have ever been uttered by Jesus. They were
published in a book referenced below."^[[2]](#note-LeaderU)^

### Jesus' deeds

-   **Red** - The historical reliability of this information is
    virtually certain. It is supported by a preponderance of evidence.
-   **Pink** - This information is probably reliable. It fits well
    with other evidence that is verifiable.
-   **Gray** - This information is possible but unreliable. It
    lacks supporting evidence.
-   **Black** - This information is improbable. It does not fit
    verifiable evidence; it is largely or entirely fictive

## Criticism

N.T. Wright ^[[3]](#note-Wright)^ identifies three actual guiding
principles of the Jesus Seminar. In each case, he writes, there is
"every reason to reject the principle in question.":

-   First, the Seminar in fact presupposes a particular portrait of
    Jesus.

-   Second, the Seminar adopts a particular, and highly misleading,
    position about eschatology and apocalyptic, particularly about the
    kingdom of God; this too was presupposed.

-   Third, the Seminar assumes a particular picture of the early
    church, especially its interest in and transmission of material
    about Jesus.

Calling the agenda "fundamentally antifundamentalist," Wright
provides this quote from the book's introduction:

Once the discrepancy between the Jesus of history and the Christ of
faith emerged from under the smothering cloud of the historic
creeds, it was only a matter of time before scholars sought to
disengage [the two] ... It is ironic that Roman Catholic scholars
are emerging from the dark ages of theological tyranny just as many
Protestant scholars are reentering it as a consequence of the
dictatorial tactics of the Southern Baptist Convention and other
fundamentalisms.
Wright continues: "Perhaps the deepest flaw in terms of apparent
method is that this book appeals constantly, as does all the
literature of the Jesus Seminar, to the possibility that by the
application of supposedly scientific or 'scholarly' criteria one
will arrive at a definite answer to the question as to what Jesus
actually said."^[[3]](#note-Wright)^

Fellows of the Seminar do not regard Christian Scriptures as
inerrant. They do not believe that the authors were uniquely
inspired by God. Rather, they view the Bible as a very human
document, composed by writers who actively promoted their own
theological beliefs (or those of the group to which the writers
belonged). The Seminar sees within early Christian writings the
evolution of religious thought.^[[1]](#note-RT)^
