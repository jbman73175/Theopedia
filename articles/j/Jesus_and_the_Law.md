## Basic definitions of Law

In taking up the discussion of the Law, it is important to define
what exactly is meant by the term. [Law](Law "Law"), in its
*broad sense*, refers to the Scriptures authored by Moses- the
first five books of the traditional Bible: Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is also what is termed in
Hebrew as "Torah" or books of instruction. Law, in its
*narrow sense*, refers to the list of commandments and regulations
placed upon Israel in a special sense and to the whole world in a
general sense (cf. Rom.2:14). This could be summed up as
"Decalogue" or the Ten Commandments. This is often the way "Law" is
used in Paul's writings.

## Jesus in the Books of the Law

In the broad sense, [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") is spoken about in the
Torah in several distinct places. Genesis 3:15 seems to foreshadow
the birth of Christ and His defeat over Satan. Genesis 32 presents
an example of God taking on human flesh when He wrestled with
Jacob. Deuteronomy 18:18 states how a prophet greater than Moses is
expected to come from amongst Israel. This is often regarded as the
verse Christ is referring to in John 5:39 when He asserts how Moses
testified to Him.

We also find Jesus in the Torah in a typological sense. The story
of Moses and his relationship to Israel as a Deliverer and Mediator
is very much a "type" to Christ. Other such "types" are found in
the
[Passover Lamb](index.php?title=Passover_Lamb&action=edit&redlink=1 "Passover Lamb (page does not exist)")
first instituted in Exodus 12. This type very much inaugurates the
sacrificial laws found throughout many other books such as
Leviticus which serve as other types to Christ's Sacrifice.

## Jesus' relationship to the Law

It can very well be said that Christ's relationship to the Law is
that of Expectation-Fulfillment. In other words, Jesus is the
fulfillment of the expectations foretold in the Mosaic Books. The
Sacrificial mandates, the regulations, the requirements in the
Decalogue all find their fullness and completion in the Person of
Jesus Christ. "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness
to everyone who believes" (Rom.10:4). That is, Christ is the "goal"
or "purpose" of the Law's demands and direction. What the Law seeks
to arrive at or reach IS arrived at and reached in Jesus Christ.

The entire goal of the Law is righteousness before God and man.
Naturally, God is the Law's primary concern, man the secondary
concern. There is nothing else the Law serves to reach other than
becoming righteous before God. But, since man has failed in all
attempts at keeping the Law, it follows that righteousness is not
attained by the Law. Thus, Jesus and the Good News offered in Him
contain the full-value of the righteousness God requires. And, such
righteousness is achieved by His blood and granted by faith alone
(Rom.3:28; 5:28).
