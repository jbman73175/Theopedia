When [God](God "God") [created](Creation "Creation") man, He chose
for [Adam](Adam "Adam") to represent his posterity as "federal
head" in the [covenant](Covenant "Covenant") of works. Hosea 6:7
speaks of a covenant which Adam broke, and Romans 5:12-19 implies
that there was a covenant involved with Adam because he represents
the human race. Isaiah 24:5 speaks of an everlasting covenant which
is universal because it applies to the entire "earth"; this would
also seem to be a reference to a covenant made with all mankind.

[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") took man's place,
fulfilling the covenant of works which Adam failed at, and thus
Adam is an [antitype](Biblical_typology "Biblical typology") of
Christ. I Corinthians 15:45 speaks of Jesus as the "last Adam."
