Elliot was born in Portland, Oregon to Fred and Clara Elliot, and
became a Christian at a young age. He graduated from Wheaton
College in 1949, with a degree in Greek. He arrived in Ecuador on
February 21, 1952, with the purpose of evangelizing Ecuador's
Quechua Indians. On October 8, 1953, he married fellow Wheaton
alumnus and missionary Elisabeth Howard in Quito, Ecuador. Their
only child, Valerie, was born February 27, 1955. While working with
the Quechua Indians, Elliot began preparing to reach the famously
violent Huaorani Indian tribe. He and four other missionaries, Ed
McCully, Roger Youderian, Peter Fleming and their pilot Nate Saint,
made contact from their airplane with the Huaorani Indians, using a
loudspeaker and a basket to pass down gifts. After several months,
the men decided to build a base a short distance from the Indian
tribe, along the Curaray River. There they were approached several
times by small groups of Huaorani Indians, and even gave an
airplane ride to one curious Huaorani who they called "George" (his
real name was Naenkiwi). Encouraged by these friendly encounters,
they began plans to visit the Huaorani, but their plans were
preempted by the arrival of a larger group of Huaorani, who killed
Elliot and his four companions on January 8, 1956. Elliot's
mutilated body was found downstream, along with those of the other
men, except that of Ed McCully.

Elliot and his friends became instantly known worldwide as
[martyrs](Martyr "Martyr"), and *Life Magazine* published a 10-page
article on their mission and death. They are credited with sparking
an interest in Christian missions among the youth of their time,
and are still considered an encouragement to Christian missionaries
working throughout the world. After her husband's death, Elisabeth
Elliot and other missionaries began working among the Auca Indians,
where they had a profound impact and won many converts. She later
published two books,
*Shadow of the Almighty : The Life and Testament of Jim Elliot* and
*Through Gates of Splendor*, which describe the life and death of
her husband.
