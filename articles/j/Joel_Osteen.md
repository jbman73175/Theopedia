Joel Osteen
**Joel Scott Osteen** (b. 1963) is the senior pastor of Lakewood
Church in Houston, Texas, and author of the New York Times
bestselling book *Your Best Life Now*. He is a proponent of the
[word of faith movement](Word_of_faith_movement "Word of faith movement")
and [prosperity gospel](Prosperity_gospel "Prosperity gospel").

Joel took over the ministry of North America's largest and
fastest-growing church^[[1]](#note-0)^ in 1999 upon the death of
his father, founder John Osteen. He assumed leadership of the
church and the role of pastor-teacher with limited biblical
training and no experience as a pastor, having dropped out of Oral
Roberts University after just one semester to manage Lakewood's
television production department.

## Background

Osteen was born in Houston as the oldest son of John Osteen, a
former Southern Baptist pastor who became a
[charismatic](Charismatic "Charismatic") in the late 1950s and
founded Lakewood Church. After graduating from high school, Joel
Osteen attended Oral Roberts University. However, after his first
semester he moved back to Houston where he became director of
television production for Lakewood Church in 1982-1999.

Osteen's father developed Lakewood into a body of approximately
6,000 members with an active television ministry, crusades,
conferences, missionary support and food distribution. He died of a
heart attack in 1999. Having produced his father's television
program for years, Joel Osteen succeeded him on October 3, 1999.
Joel Osteen never received any formal religious training. Adopting
the slogan "Discover the Champion in You," Lakewood was holding six
weekly services in a 7,800 seat sanctuary by fall 2004. Osteen is
associated with the
[Word of faith movement](Word_of_faith_movement "Word of faith movement")
in [charismatic](Charismatic "Charismatic")
[protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism").

Osteen lives in the Houston area with his wife Victoria and two
children, Jonathan and Alexandra. Critics have decried his
lifestyle as "lavish" pointing to the fact that he lives in a house
valued at over $1 million. Supporters, however, say that his income
is largely the result of his book sales and state that he declined
to take his 2005 annual salary of $174,000 as pastor of the church,
in order to use the money for other ministries. They also point to
the church's charity work, particularly during the aftermath of
Tropical Storm Allison. According to Lakewood, the church donated
over 1 million dollars to flood victims in one year alone.

Many of you today know this, you believe it down here in your
heart. But the reason that you're not experiencing as much as you
should is because your not declaring it. You've got to give life to
your faith by speaking it out. Your words have creative power. When
you go around saying, 'I have favor, people want to be good to me
and supernatural doors are opening.' When you make those
declarations of faith, you are charging the atmosphere. And your
own words can help to bring it to pass. That is why we should get
into the habit of every day consistently speaking God's favor over
our lives.^[[3]](#note-2)^

I believe one of the main ways that we grow in favor is by
declaring. It's not enough to just read it. It's not enough to just
believe it. You've got to speak it out. Your words have creative
power. One of the primary ways we release our faith is through our
words. There is a divine connection between you declaring God's
favor and seeing God's favor manifested in your life. And some of
you are doing your best to please the Lord. You are living a holy
consecrated life, but you're not really experiencing God's
supernatural favor. And it's simply because you're not declaring
it. You've got to give life to your faith by speaking it
out.^[[4]](#note-3)^

You know, it's wonderful to know that faith is a power and a force.
And I'm starting a series of messages today to help you understand
faith in God. Bible faith. Because you see, when you realize that
God works by faith, then you'll know how important it is. The Bible
says, "Without faith it is impossible to please God." Impossible.
So, if it's impossible for us to please God without faith, we ought
to understand what faith is.^[[5]](#note-4)^
