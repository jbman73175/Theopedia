Johann Sebastian Bach has long been esteemed as one of the greatest
composers in human history. Perhaps because of this fact and
because he lived more than a century after Luther, the influence of
the Reformation upon Bach's work is often overlooked. The
significance of the Reformation was not limited to its
transformative impact upon the church; it also had profound
consequences for European arts and culture. Luther's translation of
the Bible and his practice of using the arts in service of praising
God led to the flowering of vernacular hymns and the establishment
of the Lutheran chorale. One of Bach's greatest accomplishments was
the powerful combination of these two Reformation elements in his
cantatas and in the Saint Matthew Passion and Saint John Passion.
In the minds of some, Bach's masterful evocations of the suffering
and death of Jesus have established him as the Fifth Evangelist.
