Johannes Cocceius
**Johannes Cocceius** (1603 - 1669), Dutch
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian"), was born at Bremen in
Germany.^[[1]](#note-0)^

After studying at Hamburg and Franeker, where Sixtinus Amama was
one of his teachers, he became in 1630 professor of biblical
philology at the Gymnasium illustre in his native town. In 1636 he
was transferred to Franeker, where he held the chair of Hebrew, and
from 1643 the chair of theology also, until 1650, when he succeeded
the elder Friedrich Spanheim as professor of theology at the
University of Leiden.

His chief services as an oriental scholar were in the department of
Hebrew philology and exegesis. As one of the leading exponents of
the
[covenant or federal theology](Covenant_Theology "Covenant Theology"),
he spiritualized the Hebrew scriptures to such an extent that it
was said that Cocceius found Christ everywhere in the Old Testament
and [Hugo Grotius](Hugo_Grotius "Hugo Grotius") found him nowhere.

He taught that before [the fall](The_Fall "The Fall") of man, as
much as after it, the relation between God and man was a
[covenant](Covenant "Covenant"). The first covenant was a
[Covenant of Works](Covenant_of_Works "Covenant of Works"). For
this was substituted, after the Fall, the
[Covenant of Grace](Covenant_Theology "Covenant Theology"), to
fulfil which the coming of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") was necessary. He
held millenarian views, and was the founder of a school of
theologians who were called after him Cocceians.

His theology was founded entirely on the [Bible](Bible "Bible"),
and he did much to promote and encourage the study of the original
text. In one of his essays he contends that the observance of the
[Sabbath](Sabbath "Sabbath"), though expedient, is not binding upon
Christians, since it was a Jewish institution.

His most distinguished pupil was the celebrated Campeius Vitringa.
His most valuable work was his
*Lexicon et commentarius sermonis hebraici et cha*ldaici (Leiden,
1669), which has been frequently republished; his theology is fully
expounded in his *Summa Doctrinae de Foedere et Testamento Dei*
(1648).

His collected works were published in 12 folio volumes (Amsterdam,
1673-1675).
