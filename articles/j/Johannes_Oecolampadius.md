**Johannes Oecolampadius** (pronounced *ökōlämpä\`dēoos* or
*ĕk'àlămpā\`dēàs*) (1482–1531), a German Protestant reformer,
associate of
[Huldreich Zwingli](Huldreich_Zwingli "Huldreich Zwingli") in the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation") in Switzerland. He was in
1516 a preacher at Basel, where he worked with
[Erasmus](Erasmus "Erasmus") on his New Testament. In 1520 he
preached in Augsburg, then for a time was in a convent at
Altmünster. [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther")'s
teachings won his interest, and in 1522 he acted as chaplain among
reformers under Franz von Sickingen at Ebernburg and then returned
to Basel to devote himself to the work of the Reformation. He
agreed with the views of Zwingli on the nature of the Eucharist,
defending this position against Luther in the Colloquy of Marburg,
1529, while Zwingli disputed the question with Melanchthon.
