## Analysis

### 1:1-18 – Prologue

The first 18 verses of John are a prologue to the Gospel, and are
written in a markedly different style of Greek. They are carefully
crafted, concise and almost poetic.^[[1]](#note-0)^ Scholars are
divided over whether this passage was a pre-existing Christian hymn
which John adapted or whether it was written by John at the time of
writing the Gospel.^[[2]](#note-1)^ This passage clearly functions
as an introduction to the Gospel and raises many of the major
themes of the Gospel.

While [Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew") and
[Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke") open their gospels with the
birth narrative of Jesus, and
[Mark](Gospel_of_Mark "Gospel of Mark") begins with the start of
Jesus’ public ministry, John opens with the start of the universe.
The prologue moves from before pre-existence (John 1:1-2), through
creation (John 1:3), the history before the incarnation (John
1:4-5), [John the Baptist](John_the_Baptist "John the Baptist")
(John 1:6-7) and finally to Jesus’ incarnation and the results
(John 1:9-18).^[[3]](#note-2)^ This vision of salvation history
shows the cosmic importance of the Gospel of Jesus.

### 1:19-51 – From John to Jesus

The rest of the chapter 1 shows a trend away from the ministry of
[John the Baptist](John_the_Baptist "John the Baptist") towards
Jesus. In John 1:19-28, John is asked if he is the
[messiah](Messiah_in_the_Gospel_of_John "Messiah in the Gospel of John").
He replies that he is not, and that he is preparing the way for one
who is to come after him (presumably the messiah).

John 1:29-34 describes John baptising Jesus. John calls Jesus “the
Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world”. This is a
reference to Isa 53:7 and to the lamb which is sacrificed on
Passover (Jesus was crucified on Passover). This is the first hint
that Jesus was going to die, and that his death would be for the
forgiveness of sins. John then gives his first testimony about
Jesus, testifying to what he saw when he baptised him (see
[Trial and Witness in the Gospel of John](index.php?title=Trial_and_Witness_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Trial and Witness in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)")).
The [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") descending on Jesus is
a very important sign of his kingship and that he is the start of
the New Age (see
[Holy Spirit in the Gospel of John](index.php?title=Holy_Spirit_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Holy Spirit in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)")
and
[Eschatology in the Gospel of John](index.php?title=Eschatology_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Eschatology in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)")).
This is also the first time that Jesus is given the messianic title
[Son of God](Sonship_in_the_Gospel_of_John "Sonship in the Gospel of John").

John 1:35-51 continues the trend away from John to Jesus by showing
some of John’s disciples turning to follow Jesus. When Andrew tells
his brother Peter about his encounter with Jesus, he boldly
declares “We have found the Messiah” (John 1:41), introducing this
major theme (see
[Messiah in the Gospel of John](Messiah_in_the_Gospel_of_John "Messiah in the Gospel of John").
Phillip is the first disciple in the Gospel that Jesus directly
calls (John 1:43), and he tells Nathaniel. The conversation with
Nathaniel is somewhat mysterious, as Jesus reveals supernatural
knowledge of Nathaniel. Maybe Jesus t was simply showing the fact
that knew where Nathaniel was sitting, or maybe Nathaniel had an
extraordinary experience that Jesus was referring to.

Leon Morris suggests:

"It seems probable that Nathanael had had some outstanding
experience of communion with God... and that it is this to which
Jesus refers. Whatever it was, Nathanael was able to recognize the
allusion. It is difficult to explain Jesus’ knowledge of the
incident on the level of merely human knowledge. Nathanael had
never met him before this moment. We are required to understand
that Jesus had some knowledge not generally available to the human
race (cf.)."^[[4]](#note-3)^
Nathaniel’s response (John 1:49) is exactly the response called for
by the Gospel (John 20:31). Jesus’ final statement is an important
one for the Gospel; this miraculous knowledge is just the starting
point of a ministry of miraculous “signs” pointing to Jesus’
identity as the
[Messiah](Messiah_in_the_Gospel_of_John "Messiah in the Gospel of John")
and the
[Son of Man](Sonship_in_the_Gospel_of_John "Sonship in the Gospel of John")
who reveals God, culminating in his death and resurrection.
