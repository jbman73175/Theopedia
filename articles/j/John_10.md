### 8

***"All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them."***
([ESV](ESV "ESV"))
-   Jeremiah 23:1; Ezekiel 34:2

### 10

***"Do you not believe that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works."***
([ESV](ESV "ESV"))
"To see [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") is to see the
[Father](God_the_Father "God the Father") not as if Father and Son
are the same person (see 1:1b) but because they are one (10:30),
and here because they dwell in one another so thoroughly, and Jesus
remains so utterly dependent on the Father's will, that their
character is indistinguishable, as his works demonstrate (14:10).
To a lesser extent, Jesus' followers will also reflect his glory by
reflecting the divine character of unity produced by Jesus'
indwelling presence (17:23; cf. 14:20). The way to develop that
intimacy is to keep his commandments (15:10; cf. 8:29; 11:42; 1
John 3:22)." (Keener, *The Gospel of John*, p. 945)

### 34-36

***"Jesus answered them, 'Is it not written in your Law, I said, you are gods? If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be broken—do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?"***
