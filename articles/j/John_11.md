It is clear that the "Word" is God the Son, the
[pre-incarnate Christ](Incarnation "Incarnation"). He is the one
who became flesh (Jn 1:14), and thus [John](John "John") identifies
the Word with [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). At the very least this
passage teaches that Jesus pre-existed before the
[creation](Creation "Creation") of the world.
[Frame](John_Frame "John Frame") asserts that John 1:1a-b could
easily be translated, "When all things began, the Word was already
in existence" (*Doctrine of God*, p. 664).

Also clear from this passage is the
[deity of Jesus](Deity_of_Jesus "Deity of Jesus"). John clearly
writes that "All things were made through him, and without him was
not any thing made that was made," (Jn 1:3). As Creator he cannot
be a creature (i.e. created).

## The Word was God, not "a God"

> Much has been made by Jehovah's Witnesses and other groups of the
> absence of the article in John 1:1: 'In the beginning was the Word,
> and the Word was with God, and the Word was **A** God,' is the
> preferred translation of such cults. There are good grammatical
> reasons to reject this translation and interpretation . . .

### θεόν without the article

> θεόν is used with or without the article indiscriminately in the
> New Testament. In the Prologue to the Fourth Gospel it never has
> the article except in verses 1 and 2. In verses 5, 12, 13, and 18
> it appears without the article.

### Predicate Nominative

In this passage, θεὸς is a predicate. A predicate is the second
noun attached to an "is" statement ("the man is king" - "man" is
the subject and "king" is the predicate). In NT Greek, the
predicate often does not have an article, especially when the
predicate *precedes* the subject in word order. In fact, since word
order is flexible in Greek, often the only way to determine which
word is the subject and which is the predicate is by looking at the
article - the subject usually has an article and the predicate
usually does not. Thus if the article had been attached to θεὸς,
the sentence would have read "and God was the
Word."^[[1]](#note-0)^
