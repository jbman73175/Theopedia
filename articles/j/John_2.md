## Analysis

These two events introduce the start of Jesus’ public ministry. In
both instances, Jesus replaces or reinterprets Jewish symbols to
point towards him.

### 2:1-12 – The Wedding at Cana

At a wedding in Cana, Jesus turns water into wine. This is the
first miracle that Jesus performs, and the first of John’s “signs”
(John 2:11). The water that Jesus used was for ceremonial washing
(John 2:6), probably for washing utensils and the guests hands.
^[[1]](#note-0)^ Many commentators point out that Jesus is taking a
symbol of Jewish ritualism and turning it into a symbol of joy and
celebration.^[[2]](#note-1)^ This is the first in a series of
incidents where Jesus redirects Jewish tradition to point to
himself and to the
[New Age](index.php?title=Eschatology_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Eschatology in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)")
which he ushers in. In this case, the wine points to the
over-abundance of goodness that Jesus’ kingdom offers. The size of
the jars shows the incredibly large amount of wine that Jesus
created (between 120 and 180 litres).

### 2:13-25 – Jesus clears the Temple

Jesus then clears the temple of merchants and money lenders. Note
that this is not an attack on the temple or temple worship. Jesus’
wrath is not directed at the people who are worshipping, but at the
people who are selling. Equally, Jesus’ actions are driven by his
zeal for the temple (John 2:17), which shows a very positive
attitude towards it. Jesus does not object to Jewish worship, but
*incorrect* worship. Money changers and animal traders were vital
to the temple worship. It was important to have the correct animals
for the correct sacrifices, and the temple tax had to be paid in
local currency.^[[3]](#note-2)^ Deut 14:24-26 gives provision for
people who must travel a long way to buy their sacrifices when they
get to Jerusalem. The problem, Köstenberger argues, was that these
people were operating in the Court of the Gentiles, effectively
disrupting the only place that gentiles could come to worship
God.^[[4]](#note-3)^ Zechariah predicted that in the Day of the
Lord, “there shall no longer be a trader in the house of the Lord
of hosts” (Zech 14:21, although the NIV translates it differently).
Thus Jesus could be seeing himself as bringing about one of the
signs of the last days (see
[Eschatology in the Gospel of John](index.php?title=Eschatology_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Eschatology in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)")).^[[5]](#note-4)^

Then the Jews challenge Jesus’ authority. At this stage, this could
be a positive question. The cleansing of the temple stood in a long
tradition of prophetic symbolic actions, and it was appropriate to
ask a prophet to justify their claim of divine
authority.^[[6]](#note-5)^ Ironically, in demanding a sign, they
missed the significance of the sign that had just been performed
before them. Jesus’ reply is misunderstood by everybody – even the
disciples didn’t understand it until after the resurrection. He
points to his death and resurrection as the ultimate sign that will
prove his divine authority.

This passage also raises the issue of the timing of Jesus’
ministry. In the synoptics, this incident is recorded at the end of
Jesus ministry. It could be that Jesus cleared the temple twice in
his ministry, otherwise it seems that either the synoptic tradition
or John have placed this event out of order to make a theological
point. John portrays Jesus’ ministry as moving back and forth
between Galilee and Jerusalem over a three year period while the
synoptics trace a single movement from Galilee to Jerusalem over
one year. Thus John could have moved this event to the start of his
gospel as an opening to Jesus ministry, or the synoptics moved it
to the end because they only describe Jesus’ last visit to
Jerusalem.
