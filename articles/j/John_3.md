## Analysis

This chapter contains two incidents. In the first, Jesus encounters
Nicodemus, who was a member of the Sanhedrin – the ruling council
of Jerusalem. The second incident features John the Baptist, and
contains his last recorded words.

### 3:1-15 – Jesus and Nicodemus

Nicodemus comes to Jesus by night. This is probably to stop the
Sanhedrin from finding out about this meeting and thinking that
Nicodemus was a supporter of Jesus. There is no record of Nicodemus
coming to Jesus with a specific question, rather he simply praises
Jesus and recognises that he is from God (John 3:2). Jesus’
response does not seem to be linked to the question (John 3:3),
instead he challenges Nicodemus about his understanding of the
[Kingdom of God](Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God"). Apart from one
reference in 1 Peter 1:23, this conversation is the only use of the
phrase “born again” in the Bible. Nicodemus fails to understand
what Jesus means by “born again”, and Jesus explains that he refers
to a rebirth through the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit"),
which is a requirement for anyone to be part of the Kingdom of God
(John 3:5-7). Apart from Jesus’ baptism, this is the first
reference to the Holy Spirit, which becomes a major theme in the
latter half of John (See
[Holy Spirit in the Gospel of John](index.php?title=Holy_Spirit_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Holy Spirit in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)")).
Nicodemus still fails to understand, and Jesus rebukes him (John
3:9-10). Jesus’ response indicates that he expected Nicodemus (as
“Israel’s Teacher”) to have understood this before he met Jesus.
This shows that the foundations for Jesus’ teaching of the
scripture and rebirth are found in the Old
Testament.^[[1]](#note-0)^

Jesus then begins a monologue with the solemn pronouncement αμην
αμην λεγω συ (“I tell you the truth...”, “truly, truly I say to
you...” or “very truly I say to you...”). Unlike Nicodemus, he and
the disciples (presumably what he means by “we”^[[2]](#note-1)^)
speak of things that they have seen first-hand (John 3:11). This
knowledge is partly because of what the disciples have seen of
Jesus in their time with him. Jesus’ has this knowledge because he
is the [Son of Man](Son_of_Man "Son of Man") who come from heaven
(John 3:13 cf. John 3:31-32). The “heavenly things” (John 3:12)
that Nicodemus – and even the disciples – fail to understand is
that this same Son of Man must die to bring about the new birth and
the Kingdom of God (John 3:14-15. Also see
[Sonship in the Gospel of John](Sonship_in_the_Gospel_of_John "Sonship in the Gospel of John")).
Jesus’ mention of Moses lifting up the snake in the desert (John
3:14) is a reference to Numbers 21:6-9. In this incident, God
punished the disobedience Israel by sending poisonous snakes, but
instructed Moses to erect a statue of a snake, so that anyone who
looked at the statue might live. Just like that incident, God
provides a means of salvation for us, which only requires an
obediently faithful response as we “look to
Jesus”.^[[3]](#note-2)^

### 3:16-21 – The Gospel in a nutshell?

Many scholars suggest that John 3:16-21 is not a continuation of
Jesus’ speech, but is a comment by the author. This is not a
rejection of the original text, since the original Greek lacks
quote marks, or any way of defining when a quotes speech ends. One
of the signs pointing to this suggestion is the change in tense
between John 3:14-15 (future – “the Son ’’will’’”) and John 3:16
(past – “God ’’loved’’ and ’’sent’’”).^[[4]](#note-3)^ Whether it
is the words of Jesus or of John, it is still a powerful statement
of many core facts of the Bible, and of John’s theology of Jesus
and his works.

John 3:16 is one of the most translated and quoted verses in the
Bible. This passage has often been described along the lines of
“the Gospel in a nut shell”. John 3:16-21 raise the very important
Johannine topics of
[the Father sending the Son](Sonship_in_the_Gospel_of_John "Sonship in the Gospel of John"),
[salvation](index.php?title=Salvation_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Salvation in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)"),
[faith](index.php?title=Faith_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Faith in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)"),
[light and darkness](index.php?title=Light_and_Darkness_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Light and Darkness in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)"),
[revelation](index.php?title=Revelation_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Revelation in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)")
and the complex issues of
[Judgement in the Gospel of John](index.php?title=Judgement_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Judgement in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)").

### 3:22-30 – John’s last speech

The next section returns to John the Baptist, and is essentially
the last that we hear from him (The Baptist is mentioned in passing
in John 4:1, 5:33-36, 10:40-41). The passage deals with the
important issue of the relationship between John and Jesus. People
around John seem to see themselves in competition with Jesus for
disciples (John 3:26). John however shows his great understanding
of his position. John repeats that he is not
[the Christ](index.php?title=The_Christ_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Christ in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)")
but that he was preparing the way for the Christ (John 3:28). He
describes himself as a bridegroom’s friend, who waits for the
bridegroom and is full of joy when he comes (John 3:29). John shows
the remarkable ability to accept the role that God had given him
and not seek greater glory (John 3:26). His ministry was all about
preparing for, and pointing towards, Jesus. Once Jesus arrived and
began his ministry, John’s work and importance dwindled (John
3:30). This passage, among many other things, shows the humility
needed in Christian life, that we are called to point away from
ourselves and towards Christ.

### 3:31-36 – The Author’s conclusion

Like John 3:16-21 (above), many scholars believe that John 3:31-36
is an explanation by the author, rather than a continuance of John
the Baptist’s speech. The reasons are predominantly the
same.^[[5]](#note-4)^ What is most notable is that this speech
share so many common themes as 3:16-21. Along with
[sonship](Sonship_in_the_Gospel_of_John "Sonship in the Gospel of John"),
[salvation](index.php?title=Salvation_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Salvation in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)"),
[faith](index.php?title=Faith_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Faith in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)"),
[revelation](index.php?title=Revelation_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Revelation in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)"),
and
[judgement](index.php?title=Judgement_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Judgement in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)"),
this passage also discusses important issue of
[the Holy Spirit](index.php?title=The_Spirit_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Spirit in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)").
