## Analysis

This chapter relates Jesus’ interactions with two people. The first
is a Samaritan woman, and the second is a Royal Official.

### 4:1-42 The Woman at the Well

Mounting
[opposition](index.php?title=Opposition_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Opposition in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)")
to Jesus’ increasing success causes him to leave Judea and return
to Galilee via Samaria. Jesus is tired, and rests at the Well of
Jacob and, not having a bucket to draw water, he waits until a
woman arrives and asks her for a drink. This was an extraordinary
thing to do for many reasons; first of all Jews hated
[Samaritans](index.php?title=Samaritans&action=edit&redlink=1 "Samaritans (page does not exist)"),
they considered them idolatrous and unclean, and refused to have
anything to do with them (note the Parable of the Good Samaritan,
Luke 10:30-35). Secondly, Jewish men were not supposed to talk to
women whom they did not know. The woman’s reaction to Jesus shows
her surprise that e Jewish man would speak to a Samaritan woman
(John 4:9).

Jesus uses her question to speak of living water. The woman is
confused by this (John 4:11), but he reveals that he is not
speaking of physical water, but something different. This passage
does not make it clear exactly what Jesus is referring it, but his
speech at the Water Ceremony at the Festival of Temples (John
7:37-39) makes it clear that he is referring to
[the Holy Spirit](index.php?title=The_Spirit_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Spirit in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)").

The woman asks for the living water, and Jesus’ reply is the first
step to him giving it to her. His question about her husband forces
her to reveal the sinful state of her life. Jesus shows his
intimate knowledge of her personal life, and his miraculous
knowledge convinces the woman that he is a prophet. Because she has
begun to believe that Jesus is sent from God, the woman asks him
the key question that divides Jews and Samaritans – which mountain
should God be worshipped on? (The Jews worshipped on Mt. Zion in
Jerusalem while the Samaritans worshipped on Mt.
Gerizim^[[1]](#note-0)^) Jesus’ response shows that there is no
future need for a single place of worship. Instead of having a
single Temple to dwell in, God is going to make his people a temple
in which he will dwell through his Spirit (cf. 1 Cor 3:16-17; 2 Cor
6:16; Eph 2:21).

The woman shows great knowledge of the scriptures, because she
instantly connects the out-pouring of the Spirit with the coming of
the Messiah (John 4:24-25). Jesus’ response is uncharacteristically
straight-forward. This is the first passage in which he directly
states that he is the Messiah (John 4:26), and he only says it as
clearly one more time, near the end of his ministry (John
10:24-25). It is interesting that this first declaration is to a
Samaritan woman, and it raises the issue of
[Women in the Gospel of John](index.php?title=Women_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Women in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)").

The location – the Well of Jacob – and events of this passage echo
the two patriarchal stories where Isaac and Jacob gained their
wives through meetings at wells (Genesis 24:10-26; 29:1-12).
However, where the Patriarchs found faithful wives by the well, a
dominant theme of Jesus’ conversation with the woman is her
unfaithfulness to marriage. The woman also asks an important
question – “are you greater than our father Jacob?” (John 4:12).
Unintentionally, she highlights another important theme raised in
the Prologue of John – that Jesus fulfils
[the Old Testament](index.php?title=The_Old_Testament_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Old Testament in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)")).

The woman leaves to tell her whole village about her amazing
encounter with a prophet, who might be the Messiah and the whole
village comes out to see him (John 4:28-30). They urge Jesus to
stay for two days, and through that time, many of them became
believers (John 4:39-42).

### 4:31-38 – The Harvest

Between the time that the woman left and the villagers arrived,
Jesus engaged in a short conversation with his disciples. Just like
the conversation with the woman about water, a concerned question
from the disciples about food is redirected to a deeper meaning
(John 4:34). Jesus tells his disciples that his main priority is to
do the work of the Father who sent him. In the following verses he
explains the nature of this work (John 4:35-38). The harvest is the
people who God has called into his Kingdom. Over centuries, he has
sent prophets and teachers to prepare the way for Jesus – they are
the ones who have “sown the crops”. Now, with Jesus’ arrival, his
work (and the disciples’) is to reap the harvest – bring in the
people who have been prepared beforehand for the Kingdom. To
emphasise this point, the Samaritan villagers arrive straight after
he says this, and the work of “harvesting” begins immediately as
many come to faith in him.^[[2]](#note-1)^

### 4:43-54 – The Royal Official

Jesus then performs the second miracle that is called a “sign”
(John 4:54, see
[Signs in the Gospel of John](index.php?title=Signs_in_the_Gospel_of_John&action=edit&redlink=1 "Signs in the Gospel of John (page does not exist)")).
Jesus’ interrupted journey has been completed, and he arrives to a
warm welcome in Galilee (John 4:43-45). Although John 4:44 holds an
ominous hint at future rejection. Jesus returns to the site of his
first “sign” (cf. John 2:1-11) and is met by a Royal Official who
had heard of Jesus previous miracles, and travelled from Capernaum
(about 14 hours’ travel^[[3]](#note-2)^) to ask him to heal his
Son. The Official appears to show no interest in the usual
questions of Jesus’ identity as the Messiah, but is only interested
in his healing abilities. This causes Jesus to comment on the need
of the people to see miracles before they believe (John 4:48).
This, coupled with the previous negative statement about his home
town (John 4:44) suggests that the people of Galilee had faith in
Jesus’ miracles, rather than in his identity as the Messiah.
^[[4]](#note-3)^ Jesus heals the child with a word, and sends the
man home. When he hears of the miracle, the man and his whole
household believed.

It is possible that this man was a Gentile member of the court of
Herod Antipas.^[[5]](#note-4)^ If so, this miracle shows a
progression over the past two chapters: Jesus first talks to a
Jewish religious official, then to a Samaritan woman, then to a
Gentile. This progression matches the paradigmic statement of Acts
1:8, and the expansion of God’s grace from being a Jewish privilege
to an offer to the whole world.
