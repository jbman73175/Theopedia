*"Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes." (NASB)*
Some appeal to the verse to argue that John was written before the
destruction of the temple in A.D. 70.

*"For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself." (ESV)*

“The logical For (gar) is important: this verse explains how it is
that the Son can exercise divine judgment and generate resurrection
life by his powerful word. It is because, like God, he has
life-in-himself. God is self-existent; he is always ‘the living
God’. Mere human beings are derived creatures; our life comes from
God, and he can remove it as easily as he gave it. But to the Son,
and to the Son alone, God has imparted life-in-himself. This cannot
mean that the Son gained this prerogative only after the
incarnation. The Prologue has already asserted of teh pre-incarnate
Word, ‘In him was life’ (1:4). The impartation of life-in-himself
to the Son must be an act belonging to eternity, of a piece with
the eternal Father/Son relationship, which is itself of a piece
with the relationship between the Word and God, a relationship that
existed,’in the beginning’ (1:1). That is why the Son himself can
be proclaimed as ‘the eternal life, which was with the Father and
has appeared to us.’ (1 Jn. 1:2). Many systematicians have tied
this teaching to what they call ‘the eternal
[generation of the Son](Generation_of_the_Son "Generation of the Son")‘.
This is unobjectionable, though ‘the eternal generation of the son’
should probably not be connected with the term *monogenēs*
(sometimes translated ‘only begotten’: cf. notes on 1:18). In this
immediate context, it is this eternal impartation of
life-in-himself to the Son that grounds his authority and power to
call the dead to life by his powerful word.” -
