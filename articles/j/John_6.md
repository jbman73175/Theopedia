### 37

*"All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out." (ESV)*
Given 35-36, coming to Jesus entails believing in him which can
metaphorically be spoken of as eating or drinking. None who are
given to the Son by the Father will fail to come to him. The giving
of the Father to the Son (indeed, the drawing and granting of v. 44
and 65) precedes and ensures the coming of one to the Son. This
explains why those in v. 36 have seen Jesus and yet have not
believed in him: they have not been given to the Son. Cf. 64-65

### 44

*No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day.*
(ESV)
The one who is drawn can come to the Son, and the one drawn is most
assuredly raised up on the last day to eternal life. He will never
be cast out (v. 37).

### 65

*"And he said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”"*
(ESV)
"This is why I told you" in 37 and 44. This is why Judas does not
truly believe, and will betray Jesus (v. 64): it has not been
granted him by the Father to come to the Son. Judas was not drawn,
nor was he given to the Son (cf. John 12:32).
