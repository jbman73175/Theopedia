## The text

*"On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, 'If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, "Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water." 'Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified." (ESV)*

## A promise foretold in the scriptures

"The reference is not to any single passage, but to the spirit of
the Scripture, notably such passages as
[Isaiah 55:1](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Isaiah_55:1&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isaiah 55:1 (page does not exist)");
[58:11](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Isaiah_58:11&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isaiah 58:11 (page does not exist)");
[Psalms 36:8](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Psalms_36:8&action=edit&redlink=1 "Psalms 36:8 (page does not exist)")-[9](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Pslams_36:9&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pslams 36:9 (page does not exist)")."
-B. W. Johnson
"...referring not to any particular passage, but to such as
[Isaiah 58:11](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Isaiah_58:11&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isaiah 58:11 (page does not exist)");
[Joel 3:18](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Joel_3:18&action=edit&redlink=1 "Joel 3:18 (page does not exist)");
[Zechariah 14:8](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Zechariah_14:8&action=edit&redlink=1 "Zechariah 14:8 (page does not exist)");
[Ezekiel 47:1](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Ezekiel_47:1&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ezekiel 47:1 (page does not exist)")-[12](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Ezekiel_47:12&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ezekiel 47:12 (page does not exist)");
in most of which the idea is that of waters issuing from beneath
the temple, to which our Lord compares Himself and those who
believe in Him." -Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown
## The Spirit had not yet been given

"The first and second chapters of the Book of Acts is the best
comment upon this passage. When Jesus ascended to the right hand of
the Father and was glorified, he sent forth the Spirit upon his
apostles on the day of Pentecost, and the apostles in turn promised
the gift of the Spirit to all who would believe, repent, and be
baptized." -J. W. McGarvey (Fourfold Gospel)
"John's statement is about the redemptive-historical ministry of
the Spirit, not His existence."
