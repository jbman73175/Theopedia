## Quotes

### Dogmatics and Christian theology

-   "Dogmatics is often caricatured as the unholy science that
    reduces the practices of piety to lifeless propositions. But far
    from it: dogmatics is that delightful activity in which the Church
    praises God by ordering its thinking towards the gospel of Christ.
    Set in the midst of the praise, repentance, witness and service of
    God's holy people, dogmatics - like all Christian theology -
    directs the Church's attention to the realities which the gospel
    declares and attempts responsibility to make those realities a
    matter of thought." ^[[3]](#note-2)^
-   "The matter to which Christian theology is commanded to attend,
    and by which it is directed in all its operations, is the presence
    of the perfect God as it is announced in the gospel and confessed
    in the praises and testimonies of the communion of saints."
    ^[[4]](#note-3)^

### Immensity of God

-   "God's immensity is the triune God himself in the boundless
    plenitude of his being, in which he is unhindered by any spatial
    constraint, and so sovereignly free for creative and saving
    presence to all limited creaturely reality." ^[[5]](#note-4)^

### Reading Holy Scripture

-   "Engaging in the particular activity of reading Holy Scripture
    as the Word of God requires that I be a particular kind of person,
    one who through the Spirit is liberated from self-concern and the
    pursuit of self-defined interests, and formed both to love and seek
    for the ends which God establishes for human life. This is why a
    Christian theological hermeneutic will give space to describing the
    formation of the soul of the reader, so that Christian skills of
    reading and Christian reader-roles can be learned and practised."
    ^[[6]](#note-5)^
