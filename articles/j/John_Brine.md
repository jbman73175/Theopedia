**John Brine** (1703-1765), born in Kettering, Northamptonshire,
was an English
[Particular Baptist](Strict_Baptist "Strict Baptist") minister.
Brine was called into the ministry by the church at Kettering and
after occasionally preaching there for some time, he received a
call to pastor a Particular Baptist church at Coventry.

In 1730, he received a call to succeed William Morton, as pastor of
the Baptist congregation at Curriers' Hall, Cripplegate, in London.
His ministry continued there for the next thirty-five years during
which time he took a principle lead in all the public activities
and dialogue that concerned the Particular Baptist denomination. He
died on February 21, 1765 and was buried in Bunhill-Fields
cemetery. Although he left orders that no special funeral sermon
should be preached for him, his friend, Dr.
[John Gill](John_Gill "John Gill") did take that occasion to preach
a sermon to his own congregation from 1 Corinthians 15:10 - By the
grace of God I am what I am.

John Brine was a strong [Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") in his
theology and is associated with the extremes that eventually became
known as [Hyper-Calvinism](Hyper-Calvinism "Hyper-Calvinism").
