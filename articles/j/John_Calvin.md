**John Calvin** (1509-1564) was a prominent French theologian
during the
[Protestant Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation")
and the father of the theological system known as
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism").
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") and Calvin are
arguably the most significant architects of the Reformation. "If
Luther sounded the trumpet for reform, Calvin orchestrated the
score by which the Reformation became a part of Western
civilization."^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Biographical summary

As a student in Paris, he studied the liberal arts before
continuing his studies in theology at his father's request. Later,
when his father had a falling-out with the local bishop, he
instructed John to pursue an education in civil law, which he did
in Orleans. After graduating as a Doctor of Law in 1531, he
returned to Paris.

Calvin's ambition was not to be a professional lawyer, but a man of
letters. In 1532 he self-published a commentary on the Roman
philosopher Seneca's *Treatise on Clemency* that evidenced
considerable rhetorical skill, but otherwise went unnoticed.

During his time in Paris, Calvin left
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism") and
joined the [Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") movement,
subsequently becoming an informal leader to other Paris
protestants. All that is known about the occasion is what he wrote
in the preface to his commentary on the [Psalms](Psalms "Psalms"):

> To this pursuit I endeavored faithfully to apply myself in
> obedience to the will of my father; but God, by the secret guidance
> of his providence, at length gave a different direction to my
> course. And first, since I was too obstinately devoted to the
> superstitions of Popery to be easily extricated from so profound an
> abyss of mire, God by a sudden conversion subdued and brought my
> mind to a teachable frame, which was more hardened in such matters
> than might have been expected from one at my early period of life.
> 
> {{\#if:John Calvin|
> —John Calvin{{\#if:Commentary on the
> Psalms|*Commentary on the Psalms*}}
> }}

On his way to Basel in 1536 he passed through Geneva where reformer
[William Farel](William_Farel "William Farel") persuaded him to
stay and help the cause of the church, which he did for nearly two
years. As a result of government resistance, Farel and Calvin left
Geneva and Calvin moved to Strasbourg where he pastored from
1538-1541. When Calvin's supporters won the election to the Geneva
city council in 1541, he was invited back to the city where he
remained until his death in 1564.

## Calvin's writings

### The *Institutes*

John Calvin was a prolific writer of theology. His most notable
work was the *Institutes of the Christian Religion*, the first
edition of which was published in 1536 in Latin when he was
twenty-six years old. Calvin revised the *Institutes* several
times. The first edition, intended to be a catechism for French
Protestants, was a short work consisting of six chapters dealing
with the [law](Law "Law"), the
[Apostles' Creed](Apostles'_Creed "Apostles' Creed"), the Lord's
Prayer, the [sacraments](Sacraments "Sacraments"), false
sacraments, and Christian liberty (i.e. freedom). Calvin then
produced a Latin edition in 1539 that was three times as long, and
that same year he translated this second edition into French for
those who could not read Latin. Another expanded edition was
published in 1543 in Latin, with another French translation to
follow in 1545. A fourth Latin edition appeared in 1550, while the
final edition was published in 1559. The final edition differed
radically from the original 1536 edition as it was no longer merely
a manual for new believers. Instead, it had grown into a thorough
[systematic theology](Systematic_theology "Systematic theology")
comprising four books (or "volumes") and dealt with more
[doctrines](Doctrine "Doctrine") of the Christian faith.

### Commentaries

Calvin also published commentaries on twenty-three of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") books and all of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") books except
[2](2_John "2 John")-[3 John](3_John "3 John") and
[Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation"). Calvin had a
strong conviction that commentaries should be clear and brief.
Thus, his *Institutes* received more of the doctrinal discussions,
however, doctrinal matters still found their way into his
commentaries at times. The commentaries were published in both
Latin and French. A list of each commentary and its publication
date is as follows:

OT
NT
-   Isaiah (1551; expanded in 1559)
-   Genesis (1554)
-   Psalms (1557)
-   Exodus - Deuteronomy (1563)
-   Joshua (1564, just after his death)
-   **Note**: Calvin often dealt with material from his
    commentaries in lectures to students and ministers. After 1557
    these people made notes during these lectures that were published
    as the following commentaries:
-   Hosea (1557)
-   Minor Prophets (1559-1560)
-   Daniel (1561-1562)
-   Jeremiah and Lamentations (1563 & 1565)
-   Ezekiel 1 - 20:44 (1565)

-   Romans (1540)
-   1 & 2 Corinthians (1546)
-   Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians (1548)
-   1 & 2 Timothy (1548)
-   Hebrews (1549)
-   Titus (1550)
-   1 & 2 Thessalonians and Philemon (1550)
-   James, 1& 2 Peter, 1 John, and Jude (1551)
-   Acts (1552)
-   John (1553)
-   Matthew, Mark, and Luke (1555)

Even [Jacobus Arminius](Jacobus_Arminius "Jacobus Arminius"), the
founder of the anti-Calvinistic view called
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"), said the following of
Calvin's commentaries (and other writings):

Next to the study of the Scriptures which I earnestly inculcate, I
exhort my pupils to peruse Calvin’s Commentaries, which I extol in
loftier terms than Helmich himself (a Dutch divine, 1551–1608); for
I affirm that he excels beyond comparison in the interpretation of
Scripture, and that his commentaries ought to be more highly valued
than all that is handed down to us by the library of the fathers;
so that I acknowledge him to have possessed above most others, or
rather above all other men, what may be called an eminent spirit of
prophecy. His *Institutes* ought to be studied after the
(Heidelberg) Catechism, as containing a fuller explanation, but
with discrimination, like the writings of all men. ^[[2]](#note-1)^
### Sermons

Calvin was not an ivory-tower theologian. While he often revised
and expanded his *Institutes*, he was also a very committed
preacher. From 1541 onwards, Calvin conducted services on a daily
basis. During the week he would give attention to the OT, while he
would preach Sunday mornings from the NT and Sunday afternoons from
a psalm. His sermons began to be recorded in 1549 so that they
could be printed. Those sermons preserved in manuscript form are
published in the *Supplementa Calviniana*.

## Calvin's theology

### God

Calvin said that there could be no knowledge of self without
knowledge of God. All men have a natural awareness of divinity,
which is both planted in their minds and made evident through
creation. However, man has suppressed or corrupted this knowledge,
and confused the creation with the Creator. It is only when men
contemplate the greatness of God that they can come to realize
their own inadequacy. God is
[providentially](Providence "Providence") in control of all things
that come to pass, including evil things, but this does not make
him the author of [evil](Sin "Sin").

### Man

Man is created in the image of [God](God "God"). This image has
been marred by the Fall, though not destroyed. Before the Fall,
man's will was truly [free](Free_will "Free will"); however, now it
is [corrupt](Total_depravity "Total depravity") and enslaved to
[sin](Sin "Sin"). Man is totally unable to seek or choose God
unless God chooses him first.

### Jesus Christ

The person of [Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), the God-man,
provides the solution to this moral dilemma. Christ is the only
possible bridge between God and men. In the
[Incarnation](Incarnation_of_Christ "Incarnation of Christ"), God
and man were joined inseparably in one person, yet not in such a
way that the divine and human were confused. The relationship
between Christ's human and divine natures is paradigmatic for
Calvin's theology whenever the divine touches upon the human.

Calvin was the first person to describe the work of Christ in terms
of the threefold offices of [prophet](Prophet "Prophet"),
[priest](Priest "Priest"), and
[king](index.php?title=King&action=edit&redlink=1 "King (page does not exist)").
As prophet, Christ's teachings are proclaimed by the
[apostles](Apostle "Apostle") for the purpose of our salvation. As
priest, Christ's sacrifice of himself and his mediation before the
Father secures the salvation of men. As king, Christ rules the
Church spiritually in the hearts of its members.

### The Holy Spirit

The [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") unites men to Christ
when Christ is apprehended through faith in the promises of
Scripture. The Spirit leads men to Christ; without him, saving
faith is impossible.

### Justification by faith

Justification by faith is the material principle of the
Reformation. It is based upon the
[mercy of God](Mercy_of_God "Mercy of God"), not the merits of
humanity. Although the doctrines of [election](Election "Election")
and [predestination](Predestination "Predestination") are linked
with Calvin's name, the doctrine of election actually plays a
relatively minor part of Calvin's theology. As a second-generation
Reformer, his primary concern was with the government and
organization of the church rather than theology. Nonetheless,
Calvin believed in
[unconditional election](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election").

### Sacraments

Calvin taught two [sacraments](Sacraments "Sacraments"):
[baptism](Baptism "Baptism") and
[the Lord's supper](Communion "Communion"). He differed from
sacramentalists who believed that the sacraments were a means of
receiving justifying grace. Rather, they are the badges, or marks,
of Christian profession, testifying to God's grace.

Calvin was a paedobaptist, believing that infants were the proper
objects of baptism. He differed from Catholic and Lutheran
paedobaptists in arguing that baptism did not regenerate infants.
Rather, it symbolized entrance into the New Covenant, just as
circumcision did for the Old Covenant. His argument for infant
baptism draws many parallels between the two signs.

Whereas Luther and the Catholic church believed that Christ's body
was literally present in the Eucharist, and
[Zwingli](Ulrich_Zwingli "Ulrich Zwingli") taught that the Lord's
Supper was a mere memorial, Calvin took a middle ground between the
two positions. The elements were a symbol and therefore could not
be the thing they signified; the doctrines of
[transubstantiation](Transubstantiation "Transubstantiation") and
[consubstantiation](Consubstantiation "Consubstantiation") confused
the symbol and the substance. On the other hand, Zwingli's
memorialism divorced symbol and substance completely. Calvin taught
that when one receives the bread and wine, which are literal food
and drink, in a spiritual sense he receives the spiritual food and
drink of the Christian. Christ is spiritually present when the
Eucharist is received by faith.

### Church government

Calvin is the founder of the Presbyterian system of
[church government](Church_government "Church government").

At the local level, Calvin's system consisted of a council of
pastors representing the local assembly, and responsible for
teaching and shepherding the churches. The Consistory, a larger
council comprising pastors and lay elders elected according to
district, was responsible for maintaining church discipline and
watching over the moral lives of church members. At the regional
level is the presbytery, then above this a provincial synod and a
national synod.

Church government is closely tied to
[church discipline](Church_discipline "Church discipline").
Discipline is the ordering of church life in obedience to Christ in
response to the teaching of Scripture. It has a threefold aim: the
glory of God, purity of the Church, and correction of the
offender.

The power of the Church to punish offenders was limited to
excommunication. Typically, this meant denying them the Lord's
Supper, baptism for them or their children, or marriage. Although
in Calvin's day the Consistory could recommend civil punishment to
the city authorities which was often heeded.

### Calvin and Calvinism

[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") is most noted for its
understanding of soteriology which was codified at the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort") in 1618-19 in the
so-called [Five Points of Calvinism](TULIP "TULIP").

There is some debate as to whether Calvin himself would have
affirmed all five points as such. In his writings, he explicitly
affirms [total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity"),
[unconditional election](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election"),
[irresistible grace](Irresistible_grace "Irresistible grace"), and
the
[perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints").
However, his affirmation of
[limited atonement](Definite_atonement "Definite atonement") is
implicit at best. Some scholars, such as
[Norman Geisler](Norman_Geisler "Norman Geisler"), deny that Calvin
would have endorsed limited atonement; others, such as
[Roger Nicole](Roger_Nicole "Roger Nicole"), say that his theology
affirms all five points.^[[3]](#note-2)^

## Calvin's influence

### Separation of church and state

Calvin believed that the church should not be subject to the state,
or vice versa. While both church and state are subject to God's
law, they both have their own God-ordained spheres of influence.
For example, the church does not have the authority to impose
penalties for civil offenses, although it can call on the civil
authorities to punish them. Conversely, the state is not to intrude
on the operations of the church. However, it has a duty to protect
the church and its ability to function *as* the church.

As a magisterial reformer, Calvin thought of the State as a
Christian nation rather than a secular government. He did not
advocate religious freedom in the same sense as the Baptists later
would, for example. However, his ecclesiology sowed the seeds of
the modern secular democracy.

### Missiology

Geneva became a safe haven for Protestant refugees, not only from
France, but all over Europe. Calvin founded a school to instruct
men in Reformed theology and then train them to return home, preach
the Gospel, and plant churches. The city therefore became the
nucleus of missionary activity; for example, in 1561, 140
missionaries are recorded as having left Geneva. ^[[4]](#note-3)^

The missionary influence of Calvin extended not only to his native
France, but also to Scotland (home of the Presbyterian Church),
England, northern Italy, the Netherlands, and even Poland. Calvin
also sent out the first two overseas missionaries in the history of
Protestantism: an expedition to Brazil in 1556.

### The Protestant work ethic

Calvin repudiated the distinction between "sacred" and "secular"
duty and the prevailing notion that work is a necessary evil.
Rather, he taught, work is a calling from God. Therefore, one
glorifies God in his work by working diligently and joyfully.

Calvin did not invent capitalism, but he did teach that one of the
rewards of hard work is wealth. His philosophy of work allowed
capitalism to flourish where it was practiced.
