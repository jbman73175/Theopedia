**John Chrysostom** (347 - 407) was a notable Christian bishop and
preacher from the 4th and 5th centuries in Syria and
Constantinople. He is famous for eloquence in public speaking and
his denunciation of abuse of authority in the Church and in the
Roman Empire of the time. After his death he was named Chrysostom,
which comes from the Greek *chrysostomos*, "golden mouthed". The
[Orthodox Church](Orthodox_Church "Orthodox Church") honors him as
a saint (feastday, November 13) and count him among the Three Holy
Hierarchs (feastday, January 30), together with Saints
[Basil the Great](Basil_the_Great "Basil the Great") and
[Gregory the Theologian](Gregory_the_Theologian "Gregory the Theologian").
He is also recognized by the
[Catholic Church](Catholic_Church "Catholic Church"), which
considers him a saint and a Doctor of the Church, and the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England"), who
commemorate him on September 13. His relics were stolen from
Constantinople by Crusaders in 1204 and brought to Rome, but were
returned on 27 November 2004 by Pope John Paul II.

## His importance

During a time when city clergy were subject to much criticism for
their high life style, John was determined to reform his clergy at
Constantinople. These efforts were met with resistance and limited
success. He was an excellent preacher. As a theologian, he has been
and continues to be very important in Eastern Christianity, but has
been less important to Western Christianity. He rejected the
contemporary trend for allegory, instead speaking plainly and
applying [Bible](Bible "Bible") passages and lessons to everyday
life.

His banishments demonstrated that secular powers dominated the
eastern church at this period in history. It also demonstrated the
rivalry between Constantinople and Alexandria for recognition as
the preeminent eastern see. This mutual hostility would eventually
lead to much suffering for the church and the Eastern Empire.
Meanwhile in the west, Rome's primacy had been unquestioned from
the fourth century onwards. An interesting point to note in the
wider development of the papacy, is the fact that Innocent's
protests had availed nothing: demonstrating the lack of influence
the bishops of Rome held in the east at this time.

### The *Homilies against the Judaizers*

Chrysostom wrote of the Jews and of Judaizers in eight homilies
Adversus Judaeos (against the Judaizers) [1].

The second discourse is only about a third of the length of the
others. Researchers long suspected that the single manuscript in
which it was preserved was incomplete. In 1999 Wendy Pradels
discovered on the island of Lesbos a manuscript with the complete
text.

The following quotes are translations found by Paul Halsall online
at anti-Jewish sites, presumably from the original Greek; other
researchers give slightly different translations. The accuracy of
the citations is therefore uncertain.

At the time he delivered these sermons, Chrysostom was a tonsured
reader, and had not yet been ordained a priest or bishop.

-   "The festivals of the pitiful and miserable Jews are soon to
    march upon us one after the other and in quick succession: the
    feast of Trumpets, the feast of Tabernacles, the fasts. There are
    many in our ranks who say they think as we do. Yet some of these
    are going to watch the festivals and others will join the Jews in
    keeping their feasts and observing their fasts. I wish to drive
    this perverse custom from the Church right now." (Homily I, I, 5)
-   "Shall I tell you of their plundering, their covetousness,
    their abandonment of the poor, their thefts, their cheating in
    trade? the whole day long will not be enough to give you an account
    of these things. But do their festivals have something solemn and
    great about them? They have shown that these, too, are impure."
    (Homily I, VII, 1)
-   "But before I draw up my battle line against the Jews, I will
    be glad to talk to those who are members of our own body, those who
    seem to belong to our ranks although they observe the Jewish rites
    and make every effort to defend them. Because they do this, as I
    see it, they deserve a stronger condemnation than any Jew." (Homily
    IV, II, 4)
-   "Are you Jews still disputing the question? Do you not see that
    you are condemned by the testimony of what Christ and the prophets
    predicted and which the facts have proved? But why should this
    surprise me? That is the kind of people you are. From the beginning
    you have been shameless and obstinate, ready to fight at all times
    against obvious facts." (Homily V, XII, 1)

Many researchers believe that the purpose of these attacks was to
prevent Christians from joining with Jewish customs, and thus
prevent the erosion of Chrysostom's flock. A recent thesis is that
he instead tried to persuade Jewish Christians (who for centuries
had kept connections with Jews and Judaism) to choose between
Judaism and Christianity (Source: Rodney Stark,
