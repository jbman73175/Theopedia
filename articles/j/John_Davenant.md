John Davenant
**John Davenant** (1572-1641), born in London, was a prominent
17th-century theologian of the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England").

Davenant was admitted to Queens’ College, Cambridge, in 1587. He
was ordained about 1597, gained his B.D. in 1601 and his Doctor of
Divinity in 1609 at which time he became Lady Margaret Professor of
Divinity. He was elected President of Queens’ College in 1614.

Davenant is most noted as one of the five theologians selected by
King James I to represent the Church of England at the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort") in 1618. Because of
England's close political ties with Holland and the desire of the
Dutch to resolve the controversial
[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") doctrinal issues, numerous
theologians from throughout Europe were invited to attend that
synod.

Davenant distinguished himself and the English delegation at the
Synod of Dort and in 1621 was appointed by King James I to be
Bishop of Salisbury, in which capacity he served until his death in
1641.

## Davenant's theology

"John Davenant was a definite and doctrinal Protestant as we see
from his book *A Treatise on Justification*. He was clear on the
biblical teaching of justification by faith alone and he had no
sympathy with the views of the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") party in England.
He was also [Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") in his
understanding of the Doctrines of Grace. It is indeed arguable that
Davenant was the most influential member of the most important
group (the English divines) at the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort"). At Dort the 'Five
points of [Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism")' were refuted
comprehensively and the Calvinistic position vindicated. The
influence for good of the Synod of Dort itself and of the Reformed
Confessions which were written in the light of it (Westminster
Confession, Savoy Declaration and 1689 Baptist Confession) is
incalculable." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

"Despite Davenant's important role at Dort he seems to have
sympathised in part with the French theologian
[Moses Amyruat](Amyraldism "Amyraldism") (1564 - 1664). Amyraut had
proposed that in the scheme of Redemption the decree of divine
election came subsequent to the decree to provide an atonement.
This order moves away from the Calvinistic position, making the
atonement (at least hypothetically) universal in nature but,
through divine election, particular in application. The followers
of Amyraut became known as Amyraldians. While Davenant's position
on [Amyraldianism](Amyraldianism "Amyraldianism") gives rise to
scholarly debate to this day, his great contribution to the putting
forth of Calvinistic doctrine generally is without doubt."
