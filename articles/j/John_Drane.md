**John William Drane** is a Scottish theologian who is probably
best known for his two best-selling books on the Bible,
*Introducing the Old Testament* and *Introducing the New Testament*
(both published by Lion in the UK and Fortress Press in the US). He
studied in the University of Aberdeen where he was a student of
[I. Howard Marshall](I._Howard_Marshall "I. Howard Marshall"), and
he holds a PhD from the
[University of Manchester](index.php?title=University_of_Manchester&action=edit&redlink=1 "University of Manchester (page does not exist)"),
where his mentor was [F. F. Bruce](F._F._Bruce "F. F. Bruce"). His
doctoral research focused on [Gnosticism](Gnosticism "Gnosticism")
in relation to early Christian thought and practice. This interest
in esoteric spirituality later became a bridge between his study of
the Bible and his concern for Christian mission, with particular
reference to cultural change and the emergence of what he now calls
"New Spirituality" (and which some
others[Template:Who](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Template:Who&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Who (page does not exist)")
call "new age").

## Academic accomplishments

Drane began an academic career as one of the founders of the
religious studies program at the
[University of Stirling](index.php?title=University_of_Stirling&action=edit&redlink=1 "University of Stirling (page does not exist)"),
Scotland, in partnership with
[Stewart Sutherland](index.php?title=Stewart_Sutherland&action=edit&redlink=1 "Stewart Sutherland (page does not exist)")
and the late Glyn Richards. At the beginning of this century he was
appointed to teach
[Practical Theology](index.php?title=Practical_Theology&action=edit&redlink=1 "Practical Theology (page does not exist)")
in the Divinity School at the University of Aberdeen, though by the
end of 2004 he had resigned from that post and is currently a
self-employed consultant working with churches of many different
denominations throughout the United Kingdom as well as
internationally. He is also an Affiliate Professor in New Testament
and Practical theology at
[Fuller Theological Seminary](Fuller_Theological_Seminary "Fuller Theological Seminary"),
California as well as being a Visiting Scholar at
[Spurgeon's College](index.php?title=Spurgeon's_College&action=edit&redlink=1 "Spurgeon's College (page does not exist)")
in London and a Visiting Fellow of
[St John's College, Durham](index.php?title=St_John's_College,_Durham&action=edit&redlink=1 "St John's College, Durham (page does not exist)").
A course on theology and culture which was originally offered in
Aberdeen is now part of the curriculum at
[International Christian College](index.php?title=International_Christian_College&action=edit&redlink=1 "International Christian College (page does not exist)")
in
[Glasgow](index.php?title=Glasgow&action=edit&redlink=1 "Glasgow (page does not exist)"),
and he also teaches occasional courses at
[Cranmer Hall](index.php?title=Cranmer_Hall&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cranmer Hall (page does not exist)"),
an [Anglican](Anglican "Anglican") theological college in the
[University of Durham](University_of_Durham "University of Durham").

## Christian ministry

Drane's interests have never been merely intellectual and academic.
He is an [Episcopalian](Episcopalian "Episcopalian") priest and has
an established track record as a Christian leader, serving on many
key national bodies in the United Kingdom. From 1984 to 1990 he was
convener of the Mission Committee of the Scottish Churches Council,
which at the time was the official ecumenical body of all the
Scottish churches. It was in that context that some of his most
distinctive missional thinking was first conceived, and one of the
highlights of that period was an event celebrating the Christian
festival of Pentecost at
[Glasgow Garden Festival](index.php?title=Glasgow_Garden_Festival&action=edit&redlink=1 "Glasgow Garden Festival (page does not exist)")
in 1988, which attracted a record crowd of more than 48,000 people
and for which he received an award from the UK government which is
preserved in the archives of
[Action of Churches Together in Scotland](index.php?title=Action_of_Churches_Together_in_Scotland&action=edit&redlink=1 "Action of Churches Together in Scotland (page does not exist)").
For a period in the 1990s he was chairperson of the
[National Prayer Breakfast for Scotland](index.php?title=National_Prayer_Breakfast_for_Scotland&action=edit&redlink=1 "National Prayer Breakfast for Scotland (page does not exist)")
and he is currently co-chair of the Mission Theology Advisory
Group, which is a think tank jointly sponsored by the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England") and
[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland](index.php?title=Churches_Together_in_Britain_and_Ireland&action=edit&redlink=1 "Churches Together in Britain and Ireland (page does not exist)")).
His acceptance in so many different parts of the civic and
ecclesiastical establishment means that it is difficult to
categorize his thinking by reference to any of the conventional
theological divisions of conservative, liberal, evangelical, and so
on. He has been a guest of
[HM Queen Elizabeth II](index.php?title=HM_Queen_Elizabeth_II&action=edit&redlink=1 "HM Queen Elizabeth II (page does not exist)")
at her Scottish home,
[Balmoral Castle](index.php?title=Balmoral_Castle&action=edit&redlink=1 "Balmoral Castle (page does not exist)"),
while also being regarded as an important theological resource
person for the emerging church in the UK (he is a member of the
board of *mission shaped ministry*, which is part of the
[Fresh Expressions](index.php?title=Fresh_Expressions&action=edit&redlink=1 "Fresh Expressions (page does not exist)")
initiative of the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England")).

Drane is married to
[Olive Fleming Drane](Olive_Fleming_Drane "Olive Fleming Drane"),
with whom he has three children. She holds a postgraduate degree in
theology and is a Visiting Fellow of
[St John's College, Durham](index.php?title=St_John's_College,_Durham&action=edit&redlink=1 "St John's College, Durham (page does not exist)"),
as well as being an adjunct professor at
[Fuller Theological Seminary](Fuller_Theological_Seminary "Fuller Theological Seminary"),
California. They regularly work together in both church and
academic settings.
