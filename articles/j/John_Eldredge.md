## Cautions

There are certain quotes from Eldredge's books that have raised
suspicion concerning his theology. Some have taken the following
quotes to sound like [Open theism](Open_theism "Open theism"). The
following is taken from Eldredge's book, *Wild at Heart*:

-   "God is a person who takes immense risks" (p. 30).
-   "It's not the nature of God to limit His risks and cover His
    bases" (p. 31)
-   "As with every relationship, there's a certain amount of
    unpredictability. God's willingness to risk is just astounding.
    There is definitely something wild in the heart of God" (p. 32)

## *Wild at Heart*

"[Eldredge] relies on personal stories to stir your heart toward
good things. He relies less on Scripture. This is part Robert Bly
(Iron John), part Bible and part psychology."

## The other side

Despite the criticism, many Christians have been encouraged through
Eldredge's writing. His passion to take men from being "nice guys"
and to bring them to a place where they do not settle for
mediocricy has encouraged and changed many men. Eldredge has a
desire to see men become more passionate. His hope is that men
would not be afraid to take risks for the sake of their wives and
more importantly, God. Sadly, this has resulted in Eldredge
encouraging men to take risks *just as God takes risks* by giving
humans [free will](Libertarian_freedom "Libertarian freedom"). Yet,
many have looked past his shakey theology and still found
encouragement and comfort in his writings.
