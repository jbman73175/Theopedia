**John William Fletcher** (1729-1785) was a contemporary of
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley"), a key interpreter of
Wesleyan (or Arminian) theology in the 18th century, and one of
[Methodism](Methodism "Methodism")'s first great theologians. Of
French Hugenot stock, his given name was actually
*Jean Guillaume de la Flechere*. Fletcher was renowned in the
Britain of his day for his piety and generosity; when asked if he
had any needs, he responded, "...I want nothing but more
grace."^[1](#fn_1)^

Most of Fletcher's theological writings date from the period
between 1770 and 1778, when there was great conflict between Wesley
and the Methodists and British [Calvinists](Calvinism "Calvinism").
When Wesley's Calvinist opponents made the charge that Wesley had
endorsed *works righteousness*, Fletcher demonstrated that this was
not the case. Rather, Fletcher countered, Wesley's language was an
attempt to attack [antinomianism](Antinomianism "Antinomianism") in
the British Church. Fletcher's subsequent publication
*Checks to Antinomianism* supported Wesley further; this was the
first distinctively [Wesleyan](Methodism "Methodism") theological
writing published by someone other than
[John](John_Wesley "John Wesley") or
[Charles Wesley](Charles_Wesley "Charles Wesley").

Fletcher became the chief systematizer of Methodist theology.
Addressing Wesley's position on the sovereignty of God as it
relates to human freedom, Fletcher developed a particular historic
perspective espousing a series of three dispensations (time
periods) in which God worked uniquely in creation. (This is not to
be confused with
[Dispensational theology](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism"),
which was fashioned long after Fletcher's death.) Through these
dispensations, God's sovereignty was revealed not in terms of
ultimate *power* but in terms of an unfathomable *love*. Fletcher
sought to emphasize human freedom while connecting it firmly with
God's grace.

Fletcher's writings, while serious in nature, display a witty tone,
almost satirical in nature. He typically spoke of God in terms of
divine moral qualities rather than in terms of power or wrath. His
themes were:

"1. Man is utterly dependent upon God's gift of salvation, which
cannot be earned but only received; and

\2. The Christian religion is of a personal and moral character
 involving ethical demands on man and implying both human ability
 and human responsibility."^[2](#fn_2)^

Fletcher himself summarized his theological position:

"The error of rigid Calvinists centers in the denial of that
evangelical liberty, whereby all men, under various dispensations
of grace, may *without necessity* choose life...And the error of
rigid Arminians consists in not paying a cheerful homage to
redeeming grace, for all the liberty and power which we have to
choose life, and to work righteousness since the fall...To avoid
these two extremes, we need only follow the Scripture-doctrine of
free-will restored and assisted by *free-grace*."^[3](#fn_3)^

John Wesley had chosen Fletcher to lead the Methodist movement upon
Wesley's passing, but Fletcher died prior to Wesley.

Though the entire [Methodist](Methodist "Methodist") family
utilizes Fletcher's work, his writings have found particular
popularity among [Holiness](Holiness_movement "Holiness movement")
theologians.
