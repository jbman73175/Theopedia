## Quotes

-   "As concluded in the previous chapter, the unending task of
    theology is to find ways of expressing and communicating the
    biblical story in terms that make use of the intellectual and
    conceptual tools of a particular culture without being controlled
    by them. This suggests the need for both critical and constructive
    reflection on the beliefs and practices of the church in order to
    scrutinize continuously the life of the church by the standard of
    the biblical witness and to envision all of life in relationship to
    God and the mission of God in the world." ^[[1]](#note-0)^
