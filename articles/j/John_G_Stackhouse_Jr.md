John G. Stackhouse, Jr.
**John G. Stackhouse, Jr.** (b. 1960) is a Christian theologian
and, since 1998, the Sangwoo Youtong Chee Professor of Theology and
Culture at [Regent College](Regent_College "Regent College") in
Vancouver, Canada. Born in Kingston, Ontario, Stackhouse earned a
BA from Queen's University and an MA from
[Wheaton College](Wheaton_College "Wheaton College") (1982) where
he did his thesis under [Mark Noll](Mark_Noll "Mark Noll"). He
received his PhD from the University of Chicago (1987), and his
dissertation was titled "Proclaiming the Word: Canadian
Evangelicalism since World War I" and was supervised by Martin E.
Marty.

Stackhouse first taught history at the International Teams School
of World Mission and Wheaton College in suburban Chicago. He then
taught European history at Northwestern College in Iowa. From there
he returned to Canada in 1990 as the specialist in modern
Christianity in the Department of Religion at the University of
Manitoba in Winnipeg.

Stackhouse was raised in the Christian ("Plymouth") Brethren. Since
leaving that group in 1980, he has belonged to a considerable range
of churches, including Mennonite Brethren, Anglican, Reformed,
Baptist, independent, and Christian & Missionary Alliance. He
continues to be aligned with the main tenets and practices of
historic evangelicalism while exploring fresh insights on matters
of secondary importance.

For example, Stackhouse argues for an
[inclusivist](Inclusivism "Inclusivism") understanding of the
gospel and salvation
[here](http://www.christianvisionproject.com/2007/06/a_biggerand_smallerview_of_mis.html),
rejecting the notion that those who never hear of Christ are lost.
"To confine the scope of salvation to those who have heard certain
facts about Jesus and who come to accept him on this basis,
therefore, *is not necessitated* by the Bible, and in fact is not
even the best way to understand the Bible."

Stackhouse argues for an expansion of the meaning of *gospel*: "The
Christian gospel therefore is not a narrowly spiritual one, but
literally embraces everything, everywhere, at every moment. Every
action that brings shalom—that preserves or enhances the
flourishing of things, people, and relationships—is the primary
will of God for humanity. Christians ought therefore to recognize
and affirm anything our neighbors do to make peace, whether those
neighbors intend to honor God or not. Indeed, we can cooperate with
them in those ventures, since we see in them the divine agenda of
shalom."

Stackhouse defends a broad approach to apologetics that offers
warrants to the neighbour in acts of love, rather than engaging in
apologetics as "a martial art." He also offers a new understanding
of the Bible's depiction of gender, arguing that the Bible does
teach, in fact, both patriarchy and egalitarianism, and it is God's
pragmatic accommodation to human sin in the interests of furthering
the gospel that explains this apparent contradiction.

His most recent book offers an alternative to the usual cultural
options offered serious Christians: separation from all that might
compromise Christian holiness into alternative ecclesiastical
societies of witness and service or conquest of the world,
transforming it into a truly Christian economy. Instead of these
radical alternatives, Stackhouse revises "Christian realism"
according to the later Dietrich Bonhoeffer and according to his own
evangelical convictions. This ethic construes Christian
discipleship fundamentally within the primal directive of God in
Genesis 1 and 2 to fill the earth and garden it--in sum, to "make
the best of it." As such, the book both affirms and enlarges
typical evangelical priorities.
