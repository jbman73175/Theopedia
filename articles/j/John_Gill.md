## Biographical sketch

In his youth, he attended the Kettering grammar-school, mastering
the Latin classics and learning Greek by age 11. The young scholar
continued self-study in everything from logic to Hebrew. His love
for Hebrew would follow Gill throughout his life.

About age 12, Gill heard a sermon from his pastor, William Wallis,
on the text, "And the Lord called unto Adam, and said unto him,
where art thou?" (Genesis 3:9). The message stayed with Gill and
eventually led to his conversion. It was not until seven years
later that young John made a public profession when he was almost
19 years of age.

His first pastoral work was as an intern assisting John Davis at
Higham Ferrers in 1718 at age 21. He was subsequently called to
pastor the Strict Baptist church at Goat Yard Chapel, Horsleydown,
Southwark in 1719. In 1757, his congregation in need of larger
premises moved to a Carter Lane, St. Olave’s Street, Southwark. His
pastorate lasted 51 years. This [Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") Church
later became the Metropolitan Tabernacle and was pastored by
[Charles Spurgeon](Charles_Spurgeon "Charles Spurgeon").
