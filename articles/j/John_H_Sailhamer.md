**John Sailhamer** is an evangelical Old Testament scholar. He is
currently Professor of Old Testament Studies at Golden Gate Baptist
Theological Seminary in California. He was President of The
Evangelical Theological Society in 2000.

Sailhamer is a proponent of what he calls the
*Historical Creationist* view of Genesis 1 as presented in his
*Genesis Unbound: A Provocative New Look at the Creation Account*
(Multnomah Books,
1996).[[1]](http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/creation.html#hist)
Contrasted with more recognizable interpretations of the
[Genesis creation account](Interpretations_of_the_creation_account "Interpretations of the creation account"),
not many modern scholars have lent their support to this somewhat
unique view.
