## Biographical sketch

Yoder was born in Smithville, Ohio in 1927 and earned his
undergraduate degree from Goshen College. After World War Two, he
traveled to Europe to direct relief efforts for the Mennonite
Central Committee. While in Europe, he married Anne Marie Guth, in
1952. He completed his Th.D. at the University of Basel,
Switzerland, under Karl Barth. Anecdotally true to form, the night
before he was to defend his dissertation on
*Anabaptism and Reformation in Switzerland* (2004), Yoder visited
Barth's office to deliver an entirely different documentâ€”a thorough
critique of Barth's position on war which he had written in the
meantime. This long essay has now been published in
*Karl Barth and the Problem of War* (2000) Yoder was instrumental
in reviving European Mennonites following World War II.

Upon returning to the United States, John spent a year working at
his father's greenhouse business in Wooster, Ohio, and then began
teaching at Goshen Biblical Seminary. He was Professor of Theology
there from 1965 to 1984 and served as President from 1970-1973.

While still teaching at Goshen, he also began teaching at the
University of Notre Dame, where he became a Professor of Theology
and later was named a Fellow of the Institute of International
Peace Studies. He died of an aortic aneurysm in South Bend, Indiana
on December 30, 1997.

## Yoder's theology

Of his many books, the most widely recognized has undoubtedly been
The Politics of Jesus (1972); it has been translated into at least
ten languages. In it, Yoder argues against popular views of Jesus,
particularly those views held by Reinhold Niebuhr, which he
believed to be dominant in the day. Niebuhr argued a particular
view of just war philosophy, which Yoder felt failed to take
seriously the call or person of Jesus Christ. After showing what he
believed to be inconsistencies of Niebuhr's perspective, Yoder
attempted to demonstrate by an exegesis of the Gospel of Luke and
parts of Paul's letter to the Romans that, in his view, a radical
Christian pacifism was the most faithful approach for the disciple
of Christ. Yoder argued that being Christian is a political
standpoint, and Christians ought not ignore that calling.

The Politics of Jesus was named by evangelical publication
Christianity Today as one of the most important Christian books of
the 20th century.

While he did important writing in the fields of Anabaptist history
and peace studies, Yoder is best remembered for his reflections on
Christian ethics. Rejecting the assumption that human history is
driven by coercive power, Yoder argued that it was rather God,
working in, with, and through the non-violent, non-resistant
community of disciples of Jesus, that was the ultimate force in
human affairs. If the Christian church in the past made alliances
with political rulers, it was because it had lost confidence in
this truth.

He called the arrangement whereby the state and the church each
supported the goals of the other Constantinianism, and he regarded
it as a dangerous and constant temptation. Yoder argued that Jesus
himself rejected this temptation, even to the point of dying a
horrible and cruel death. Resurrecting Jesus from the dead was, in
this view, God's way of vindicating Christ's unwavering obedience.

Likewise, Yoder argued, the primary responsibility of Christians is
not to take over society and impose their convictions and values on
people who don't share their faith, but to "be the church." By
refusing to return evil for evil, by living in peace, sharing
goods, and doing deeds of charity as opportunities arise, the
church witnesses, says Yoder, to the fact that an alternative to a
society based on violence or the threat of violence is possible.
Yoder claims that the church thus lives in the conviction that God
calls Christians to imitate the way of Christ in his absolute
obedience, even if it leads to their deaths, for they, too, will
finally be vindicated in resurrection.

Needless to say, Yoder's account of Christian faith and ethics has
been controversial. Towards the end of his life, interestingly, he
began to think about the use of a global police force as a limited
instance where Christians could support the use of coercive force.

He was a major influence on his colleague at Notre Dame
[Stanley Hauerwas](Stanley_Hauerwas "Stanley Hauerwas") who now
teaches at Duke Divinity School.
