**John Kennedy** (1819-1884) of Dingwall, was a Scottish preacher
and theologian. He was also a staunch defender of the Reformed
Faith who was, as his friend
[Charles Spurgeon](Charles_Spurgeon "Charles Spurgeon") described
him, *true as steel and firm as a rock*.

He was educated in the parish school of Killearnan, and in 1836
went to Aberdeen University. He graduated M.A. at King's College in
1840, and in the same year entered the theological hall of the
established church in Scotland. Kennedy was licensed by the
established church in September 1843, but joined the free church
and was inducted into a free church newly formed at Dingwall,
Rosshire, February 1844. He was pastor of Dingwall Free Church
congregation from 1844 until his death in 1884 at the age of 65.

Kennedy was a stalwart opponent of the drift in Scottish
Presbyterianism away from the Westminster Confession, allying
himself with Hugh Martin and [James Begg](James_Begg "James Begg")
to resist erosion of the doctrine of the particular design in
Christ's atoning work,
[definite atonement](Definite_atonement "Definite atonement"), and
to contend for the propriety of a cooperative association of church
and state to promote the true religion.
