John Knox
**John Knox** (ca. 1513 - 1572) was a Scottish religious reformer
who was the leading figure in reforming the
[Church in Scotland](Church_in_Scotland "Church in Scotland") in
[Presbyterianism](Presbyterian "Presbyterian"). He died in
Edinburgh on November 24, 1572.

John Knox was ordained in the Catholic church sometime between 1530
and 1540. He first publicly professed the
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") faith in 1545. The immediate
instrument of his actual conversion was probably George Wishart,
who, after a period of banishment, returned to his native country
in 1544, to perish, within two years, at the stake, as the last and
most illustrious of the victims of Cardinal Beaton.

While residing in the castle of St.Andrews, a stronghold and place
of refuge for many Protestants, in July of 1547, the castle was
seized by outside forces and John Knox became a French galley-slave
for nineteen months. There he experienced hardships and miseries
which are said to have permanently injured his health.

Due to the troubling times in Scotland, Knox went to England in
1549 and preached the Bible until the reign of Queen Mary I (1553
to 1558, a.k.a. Bloody Mary), during which time he removed himself
to Frankfort Germany. There he came under the influence of
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"). He eventually returned to
Scotland after several years in Geneva, and began preaching against
the Papal Church. He was arrested under Queen Mary Stuart of
Scotland in 1560 and tried for treason, but was acquitted. He spent
his remaining years preaching and lecturing in Edinburgh and St.
Andrews.
