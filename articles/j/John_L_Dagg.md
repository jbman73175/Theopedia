John L. Dagg
**John Leadley Dagg** (1794–1884) born in Loudoun County, Virginia,
lived to be over 90 years old. He died in June of 1884, as one of
the most respected men in American [Baptist](Baptist "Baptist")
life and remains one of the most profound thinkers produced by his
denomination. Dagg overcame extraordinary problems – a limited
education, near-blindness, and being crippled – to become a great
pastor in Philadelphia and elsewhere and then an educator both in
Alabama and as president at Mercer University in Georgia. He was a
convinced [Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") of an evangelical kind
who wrote a winsome English prose.

As an educator and theologian, Dagg is best known for his work in
Georgia between 1844 and 1870. From 1844 to 1856 he was on the
faculty of Mercer University, then located in Penfield, as
professor of theology and later president of the college.

His greatest contribution to Baptist life came after his retirement
in 1856. He prepared *A Manual of Theology* (1857), the first
systematic theology by a Baptist in America,
*A Treatise on Church Order* (1858),
*The Elements of Moral Science* (1859), and
*The Evidences of Christianity* (1869). His reputation as a
theologian and ethicist rests on these four works. The first two
are still in print.
