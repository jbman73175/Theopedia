**John Locke** (1632-1704) was a 17th-century English philosopher
whose ideas formed the foundation of liberal democracy and greatly
influenced both the American and French revolutions. His
contributions to philosophy include the theory of knowledge known
as empiricism, which addressed the limits of what we can understand
about the nature of reality. Locke held that our understanding of
reality ultimately derives from what we have experienced through
the senses. The political implications of his theories included the
notions that all people are born equal and that education can free
people from the subjugation of tyranny. Locke also believed that
government had a moral obligation to guarantee that individuals
always retained sovereignty over their own rights, including
ownership of property that resulted from their own labor.
