John MacArthur
**John MacArthur** (June 14 1939 - ) is the pastor-teacher of
[Grace Community Church](http://www.gracechurch.org) in Sun Valley,
California, as well as an author, conference speaker, president of
[The Master’s College](http://www.masters.edu) and
[Seminary](http://www.tms.edu/), and featured teacher with the
[Grace to You](Grace_to_You "Grace to You") media ministry.

In 1969, after graduating from Talbot Theological Seminary, John
came to [Grace Community Church](http://www.gracechurch.org). The
emphasis of his pulpit ministry is the careful study and
verse-by-verse exposition of the Bible, with special attention
devoted to the historical and grammatical background behind each
passage. Under John’s leadership,
[Grace Community Church's](http://www.gracechurch.org) two morning
worship services fill the 3,500-seat auditorium to capacity.
Several thousand members participate every week in dozens of
fellowship groups and training programs, most led by lay leaders
and each dedicated to equipping members for ministry on local,
national, and international levels.

In 1985, John became president of
[The Master’s College](http://www.masters.edu) (formerly Los
Angeles Baptist College), an accredited, four-year liberal arts
Christian college in Santa Clarita, California. In 1986, John
founded [The Master's Seminary](http://www.tms.edu/), a graduate
school dedicated to training men for full-time pastoral roles and
missionary work.

John is also president and featured teacher with
[Grace to You](http://www.gty.org). Founded in 1969,
[Grace to You](http://www.gty.org) is the nonprofit organization
responsible for developing, producing, and distributing John’s
books, audio resources, and the
“[Grace to You](http://www.gty.org)” radio and television programs.
“[Grace to You](http://www.gty.org)” radio airs more than 1,000
times daily throughout the English-speaking world, reaching major
population centers on every continent of the world. It also airs
nearly 1,000 times daily in Spanish, reaching 23 countries from
Europe to Latin America. “[Grace to You](http://www.gty.org)”
television airs weekly on DirecTV in the United States, and is
available for free on the Internet worldwide. All of John’s 3,000
sermons, spanning more than four decades of ministry, are available
for free download.

Since completing his first best-selling book The Gospel According
to Jesus in 1988, John has written nearly 400 books and study
guides, including Our Sufficiency in Christ, Charismatic Chaos,
Ashamed of the Gospel, The Murder of Jesus, A Tale of Two Sons,
Twelve Ordinary Men, The Truth War, The Jesus You Can’t Ignore,
Slave, and The MacArthur New Testament Commentary series. John's
titles have been translated into more than two dozen languages. The
MacArthur Study Bible, the cornerstone resource of his ministry, is
available in English (NKJ, NAS, and ESV), Spanish, Russian, German,
French, Portuguese, and Italian, with Chinese and Arabic
translations underway.

John and his wife, Patricia, live in Southern California and have
four adult children: Matt, Marcy, Mark, and Melinda. They also
enjoy the enthusiastic company of their seventeen grandchildren.
