## Early years

John Nelson Darby was born in
[Westminster, London](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Born_in::w:Westminster,_London&action=edit&redlink=1 "Born in::w:Westminster, London (page does not exist)")
of an Anglo-Irish landowning family and christened at St.
Margaret's on March 3, 1801. He was educated at
[Attended school::Westminster School](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Attended_school::Westminster_School&action=edit&redlink=1 "Attended school::Westminster School (page does not exist)")
and
[Trinity College, Dublin](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Attended_college::w:Trinity_College,_Dublin&action=edit&redlink=1 "Attended college::w:Trinity College, Dublin (page does not exist)"),
where he graduated Classical Gold Medallist in 1819.

Darby embraced Christianity during his studies. He joined an "inn
of court" but felt that being a lawyer was inconsistent with his
religious belief, and so chose ordination as an Anglican clergyman
in Ireland. (There is no evidence that he studied theology). Darby
travelled extensively ministering to communities of the poor and
uneducated of Ireland.

## Middle years

In October of 1827 Darby fell from a horse and was seriously
injured. During his recuperation, he spent his time grappling with
the issues of man's relationship with God. Darby saw from Scripture
that the church comprised every true believer in Christ. He also
came to believe that the very notion of a clergyman was an affront
to the Holy Spirit working in individuals and the Church. Within a
year Darby had joined with others of similar belief (Dr. Cronin, Mr
Bellett and Mr. Hutchinson) to "break bread" together in Dublin.

## Later years

Darby travelled widely in Europe and many "brethren" gatherings
resulted. He also preached in the U.S., Canada and Australia. He
used his classical skills to translate the Bible from the original
texts. In English he wrote a Synopsis of the Bible and many other
scholarly religious articles. He wrote hundreds of hymns and poems,
the most famous being,
"*[Man of Sorrows](http://www.plymouthbrethren.com/jndms.mv?bf=1)*".
He was also a prolific Bible Commentator. He died as the most
respected elder (a moniker that he personally would not have
accepted) of the brethren movement. Darby never married, although
he had an association with the wealthy widow Lady Powerscourt. He
is buried in Bournemouth, Dorset, England.

## The Brethren

From this simple beginning the Brethren movement arose. Over the
next 175 years, there were many divisions resulting in "Plymouth
Brethren", "Open Brethren", "Exclusive Brethren", "Kelly Brethren"
etc. Each faction claims to hold "the truth" more exactly than the
others, whereas in reality the factions are usually the result of
human power struggles. Being well educated and a forceful debater,
Darby was able to dominate most of the brethren discussions in his
time. This led to his being considered the leader and, indeed,
originator, of the Brethren movement.

The Brethren claimed to be teaching "rediscovered truths." Darby is
noted in the theological world as the father of
"[dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism")." He is
said to have originated the "secret rapture" theory wherein Christ
will snatch away his true believers from this world without
warning. Some authors (e.g.
[Evangelicals and Israel: Theological Roots of a Political Alliance](http://www.religion-online.org/cgi-bin/relsearchd.dll/showarticle?item_id=216))
claim that dispensationalism theory influenced the British
government to issue the Balfour Declaration 1917. If this is true,
Darby influenced current world events.
