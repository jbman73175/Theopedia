**John Owen** (1616 - 1683) was an English theologian and "was
without doubt not only the greatest theologian of the English
[Puritan](Puritan "Puritan") movement but also one of the greatest
European Reformed theologians of his day, and quite possibly
possessed the finest theological mind that England ever produced"
("Owen, John", in *Biographical Dictionary of Evangelicals*, p.
494)

## Biographical sketch

Owen entered Queen's College, Oxford, at the age of twelve and
received a B.A. in 1632 and an M.A. in 1635 at the age of nineteen.
"While at Oxford his tutor was Thomas Barlow, an
anti-[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") philosopher whose
[metaphysics](Metaphysics "Metaphysics") were to prove a formative
influence on the thought of the young Owen"
([ibid.](Ibid. "Ibid.")). In 1637 Owen became a pastor; in the
1640s he was chaplain to
[Oliver Cromwell](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell "wikipedia:Oliver Cromwell"),
and in 1651 he was made Dean of Christ Church, Oxford's largest
college. In 1652 he was given the additional post of
Vice-Chancellor of the University. After 1660 he led the
Independents through the bitter years of persecution until his
death in 1683.

Owen's first publication was *A Display of Arminianism* (1642), a
severe critique of the
[Arminian theology](Arminianism "Arminianism") becoming prevalent
in his day. Later works included
*Of the Mortification of Sin in Believers* (1656) and
*Of Temptation: The Nature and Power of It* (1658), which reflect
Owen's more pastoral nature.

His most influential work,
*The Death of Death in the Death of Christ* (1647), when Owen was
31 years old, is an exhaustive treatment and defense of the
doctrine of
[limited atonement](Definite_atonement "Definite atonement"). More
specifically, it is an extended reflection on "the
inner-trinitarian life of God for the
[incarnation](Incarnation "Incarnation") and
[atonement](Atonement_of_Jesus "Atonement of Jesus"), and an
attempt to draw out the implications of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") sacrificial context
for understanding the events of Calvary... Owen's concern was to
ask the simple question of whether Christ's death made
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") possible or actual. He affirmed
the latter..." (BDE, p. 496). Regarding this work,
[J. I. Packer](J._I._Packer "J. I. Packer") notes, "Nobody has a
right to dismiss the doctrine of the limitedness, or particularity,
of atonement as a monstrosity of Calvinistic logic until he has
refuted Owen's proof that it is part of the uniform biblical
presentation of redemption, clearly taught in plain text after
plain text. And nobody has done that yet."

In 1662 the
[Act of Uniformity](Act_of_Uniformity "Act of Uniformity")
established various rules and requirements which were to be
followed in the Church. Owen did not ascribe to this, and thus was
known as a [nonconformist](Nonconformist "Nonconformist").

Later works of Owen involved massive works on the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") and
[Hebrews](Hebrews "Hebrews").

## Quotes

-   "To suppose that whatever God requireth of us that we have
    power of ourselves to do, is to make the cross and grace of Jesus
    Christ of none effect." (*Works of John Owen: volume 3* pg. 433)
-   "To say that we are able by our own efforts to think good
    thoughts or give God spiritual obedience before we are spiritually
    regenerate is to overthrow the gospel and the faith of the
    universal church in all ages." (*The Holy Spirit*
    [[2]](http://monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/onsite/owenoverthrow.html))
-   An excerpt from his epitaph: "In polemical theology, with more
    than herculean strength, he strangled three poisonous serpents, the
    Arminian, the Socinian, and the Roman." (transl. from the Latin by
    [J. I. Packer](J._I._Packer "J. I. Packer"),
    *A Quest for Godliness*, 192)
