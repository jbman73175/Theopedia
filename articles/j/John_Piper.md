John Piper
**John Stephen Piper** (born January 11, 1946, Chattanooga,
Tennessee) is a [theologian](Theologian "Theologian"),
[pastor](Pastor "Pastor"), and author. He is currently the senior
pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church, a Reformed Baptist Church
located in Minneapolis, MN. Piper, holding to what is known as
"historic premillennialism" (otherwise known as
post-tribulationalism), is also a traditional 5 points of
Calvinist, holding, additionally, to the "Calvinistic" ideas of
double-predestination (the flip-side of unconditional election,
also known as unconditional reprobation) and the
best-of-all-possible-worlds (the belief that, in the longrun, God's
glory will be more fully displayed and His people more fully
satisfied than would be the case in any other senario for the
world.)

John Stephen Piper was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee on
[Date of birth::January 11, 1946](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Date_of_birth::January_11,_1946&action=edit&redlink=1 "Date of birth::January 11, 1946 (page does not exist)").
When John and his older sister were still small the Pipers moved to
Greenville, South Carolina where John spent the rest of his
growing-up years.

At
[Attended college::Wheaton College](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Attended_college::Wheaton_College&action=edit&redlink=1 "Attended college::Wheaton College (page does not exist)")
(1964-68), John majored in Literature and minored in
[Philosophy](Philosophy "Philosophy"). Studying Romantic Literature
with Clyde Kilby stimulated the poetic side of his nature and today
he regularly writes poems to celebrate special family occasions as
well as composing story-poems (based on the life of a Biblical
character) for his congregation during the four weeks of Advent
each year. At Wheaton John also met Noel Henry whom he married in
1968.

Following college he completed a Bachelor of Divinity degree at
[Attended seminary::Fuller Theological Seminary](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Attended_seminary::Fuller_Theological_Seminary&action=edit&redlink=1 "Attended seminary::Fuller Theological Seminary (page does not exist)")
in Pasadena, California (1968-71). While at Fuller, John took as
many courses as he could from
[Dr. Daniel Fuller](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Had_seminary_professor::Daniel_Fuller&action=edit&redlink=1 "Had seminary professor::Daniel Fuller (page does not exist)"),
the most influential "living" teacher in his life. Through Dr.
Fuller he discovered the writings of Jonathan Edwards, his most
influential "dead" teacher.

John did his doctoral work in
[New Testament Studies](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Doctoral_category::New_Testament&action=edit&redlink=1 "Doctoral category::New Testament (page does not exist)")
at the
[Attended university::University of Munich](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Attended_university::University_of_Munich&action=edit&redlink=1 "Attended university::University of Munich (page does not exist)"),
Munich, West Germany (1971-74). His dissertation, Love Your
Enemies, was published by Cambridge University Press and Baker Book
House. Upon completion of his doctorate he went on to teach
Biblical Studies at
[Taught at::Bethel College](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Taught_at::Bethel_College&action=edit&redlink=1 "Taught at::Bethel College (page does not exist)")
in St. Paul, Minnesota for six years (1974-80).

In 1980, sensing an irresistible call of the Lord to preach, John
became the senior pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in
Minneapolis, Minnesota where he has been ministering ever since.

*Biographical info from [Desiring God Ministries](http://www.desiringgod.org/AboutUs/JohnPiper/ExtendedBiography/).*
His philosophy is characterized by the statement "God is most
glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him"
[[1]](http://www.desiringgod.org) and he calls it "Christian
Hedonism" - an intentionally provocative phrase that emphasizes
that we all pursue our happiness, and it finds its ultimate
fulfillment in God himself.
