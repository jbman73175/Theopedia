John Stott
**John R. W. Stott**, (1921 - 2011) was born in London and was an
evangelical [Anglican](Anglican "Anglican"), preacher, and teacher
of Scripture. "He was ordained in 1945 and for most of his years
has served in various capacities at All Souls Church in London,
where he carried out an effective urban pastoral ministry. A leader
among evangelicals in Britain, the United States and even around
the world, Stott was a principal framer of the landmark
[Lausanne Covenant](Lausanne_Covenant "Lausanne Covenant") (1974).
Whether in the West or in the Third World, a hallmark of Stott's
ministry has been expository preaching that addresses not only the
hearts but also the minds of contemporary men and women."

Stott was educated at Rugby School and Trinity College Cambridge,
and trained for the pastorate at Ridley Hall, Cambridge. He was
awarded a Lambeth doctorate in divinity in 1983.

## Stott on Annihilationism

John Stott caused a stir among evangelicals in 1988 with his
tentative support of
[Annihilationism](Annihilationism "Annihilationism").^[[2]](#note-1)^

"I find the concept [of eternal conscious punishment in hell]
intolerable and do not understand how people can live with it
without either cauterising their feelings or cracking under the
strain. But our emotions are a fluctuating, unreliable guide to
truth and must not be exalted to the place of supreme authority in
determining it. As a committed Evangelical, my question must be --
and is -- not what does my heart tell me, but what does God's word
say?" ^[[3]](#note-2)^
