**John F. Walvoord** (1910-2002) was a theologian, pastor, and
president of
[Dallas Theological Seminary](Dallas_Theological_Seminary "Dallas Theological Seminary")
from 1952 to 1986. He was author of over 30 books, including
*The Bible Knowledge Commentary* (with Roy Zuck). He earned AB and
DD degrees from
[Wheaton College](Wheaton_College "Wheaton College"), an AM degree
from Texas Christian University, a ThB, ThM, and ThD from Dallas
Theological Seminary, and a LittD from Liberty Baptist Seminary.

## Biographical sketch

Walvoord was brought up in a Christian home, but had little
interest in the faith until he was fifteen, when his family moved
to Racine after his father accepted a position as superintendent of
the junior high. They joined the Union Gospel Tabernacle where he
committed his life to Christ after attending a Bible study on
Galatians.

After continuing his education at Wheaton College, Walvoord went on
to Texas Christian University and Dallas Theological Seminary where
he completed his ThD in 1936. Seminary president and mentor
[Lewis Sperry Chafer](Lewis_Sperry_Chafer "Lewis Sperry Chafer")
appointed Walvoord registrar. During his tenure, he also taught
systematic theology at the seminary, and pastored the Rosen Heights
Presbyterian church in Fort Worth. Walvoord became more involved in
the administration of the school, serving as Chafer’s assistant and
secretary to the faculty, and upon Chafer’s death in 1952, became
the seminary’s second president where he served until his
retirement in 1986.

In addition to his responsibilities at the seminary, Walvoord
earned a reputation as one of the most influential
[dispensational](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") theologians
of the twentieth century and played a prominent role in advocating
a pretribulational [rapture](Rapture "Rapture"), a literal
thousand-year
[millennium](Millennial_kingdom "Millennial kingdom"), and a
distinction between Israel and the church.
