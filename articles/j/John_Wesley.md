## Biographical sketch

After being educated at Christ Church College, Oxford, Wesley was
ordained in 1725. Upon finishing his studies, Wesley remained at
Oxford for a time to teach. At the University John became a member
of a small group which had gathered round his brother
[Charles Wesley](Charles_Wesley "Charles Wesley"). The group of
Christians, which included
[George Whitefield](George_Whitefield "George Whitefield") and
James Hervey, became known as the "Holy Club" or the "Oxford
Methodists."

These earnest young men caused a sensation at Oxford by frequently
meeting together for Bible study, communion, and prayer. They were
derisively referred to as the Holy Club, Sacramentarians, Bible
moths (feeding on the Bible as moths on cloth), Bible bigots, and
Methodists. John was called the curator or father of the Holy
Club.

In 1735, following the death of his father, John Wesley and his
brother Charles spent a short time as missionaries in America.
During their absence, the Holy Club began to dissolve.

John was to be missionary to the native Americans and pastor of the
Savannah parish, but his pursuit of a romance with Sophia Hopkey,
niece of the chief magistrate of Savannah, contributed to the
failure of this endeavor. Sophia, rejected by John, married another
man and Wesley excluded her from Holy Communion. Wesley had
faithfully served his flock but had exhibited a stiff high
churchmanship that antagonized the parish. The Hopkey affair
produced enough misunderstanding and persecution to cause John to
flee Georgia and return to England after less than two years.

Upon Wesley's return to England, he joined George Whitefield in
Bristol. Wesley's passionate sermons upset the local Anglican
clergy and he found their pulpits closed to him. Encouraged by an
account of the Great Awakening in New England by
[Jonathan Edwards](Jonathan_Edwards "Jonathan Edwards") and by
[George Whitefield](George_Whitefield "George Whitefield")'s
successes at outdoor preaching, Wesley swept away his
ecclesiastical and High Church views and began preaching in fields
at Bristol (1739).

Wesley was a member of the Church of England until his death and
would not schedule Methodist meetings to conflict with Anglican
services. However, during the following fifty years John Wesley
reportedly rode 250,000 miles on the roads of England, Scotland,
and Ireland preaching 42,000 sermons. Besides this he published 233
books. His tireless and incessant activity changed the face of
British society and the nature of its religion forever.

Wesley received over Â£30,000 in royalties from his writings, which
was primarily used for charitable work including the foundation of
Kingswood School in Bristol. Wesley and his followers became known
as Methodists. By the time John Wesley died in 1791, the Methodist
movement had over 76,000 members.

## Wesleyan understanding of sanctification

Wesley considered the Methodist theology of
[sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification") to be perhaps the
movement's most important contribution to Christian theology. He
believed, in a similar (but not exact) fashion to
[Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy"), that
Christians could be rid of the taint of
[original sin](Original_sin "Original sin"); this
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") is typically known as
[Wesleyan perfectionism](Wesleyan_perfectionism "Wesleyan perfectionism").

Wesley generally believed that the
[sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification") process was
gradual. Methodism, for the most part, adopted this view. Wesley's
colleague, [John Fletcher](John_Fletcher "John Fletcher"), believed
that one could experience perfection in a crisis moment. Wesleyans
convinced of Fletcher's position typically refer to perfection as
*entire sanctification*, and comprise the
[Holiness movement](Holiness_movement "Holiness movement").

Wesley described his view of the gradual outworking of salvation in
these words: "...in another instant, the heart is cleansed, from
all sin, and filled with pure love to God and man. But even that
love increases more and more, till we "grow up in all things into
him that is our Head;" till we attain "the measure of the stature
of the fullness of Christ.""(1)

## Wesley and Arminianism

His father introduced John to
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"), but he truly embraced it
later while in college. Wesley developed a strong aversion to the
[Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") doctrines of
[election](Election "Election") and
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination") and therefore
adopted Arminian doctrine -- refining it with a strong evangelical
emphasis on the Reformed doctrine of
[justification](Justification "Justification") by faith.

Wesley claimed full adherence to the doctrines of
[original sin](Original_sin "Original sin") and the
[depravity of man](Total_depravity "Total depravity"), i.e. he
denied the natural free will to do good as a result of the Fall.
However, he also taught that
[prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace")
is given everyone, so that the ability to choose the good is
restored to all, even before regeneration.

"It is proper to say that the Arminian-Wesleyan tradition teaches
human freedom in the context of prevenient grace. We can either
accept Christ or reject Him - and our eternal destiny depends upon
our free response to God's offer of salvation."
[J. Kenneth Grider](http://www.bibleviews.com/humanfreedom.html)

Wesley's variety of evangelical Arminianism survives today in
Methodism, the Churches of the Nazarene, and other Wesleyan
groups.
