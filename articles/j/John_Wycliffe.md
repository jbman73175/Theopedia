**John Wycliffe** (1324-1384), also spelled **Wyclif**, lived
almost 200 years before the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation"), but his beliefs and
teachings closely match those of Luther, Calvin and other
Reformers. As a man ahead of his time, historians have called
Wycliffe the *Morning star of the Reformation*.

"Born in the 1300s, Wycliffe criticized abuses and false teachings
in the Church. In 1382 he translated an English
[Bible](Bible "Bible") -- the first European translation done in
over 1,000 years. The Lollards, itinerant preachers he sent
throughout England, inspired a spiritual revolution.

"But the Lollard movement was short-lived. The Church expelled
Wycliffe from his teaching position at Oxford, and 44 years after
he died, the Pope ordered his bones exhumed and burned. Intense
persecution stamped out his followers and teachings. It would be
nearly two-hundred years before men like
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") resurrected the
reforms of which Wycliffe dreamed." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

"Those Heretics who pretend that the laity do not need to know
God's law, and that the things which priests have told them is
enough, do not deserve to be listened to. For the Bible is the
faith of the Church, and the more widely it becomes known the
better it will be. Therefore since the laity should know the faith,
it should be taught in whatever language is most easily
understood." - John Wycliffe ^[[2]](#note-1)^
