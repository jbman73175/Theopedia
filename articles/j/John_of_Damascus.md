## Biography

John was born in Damascus to Christian parents. His family
represented the Christians at the court of the local Muslim leader.
John originally took over this role from his father, but could not
ignore the call of the church. He gave up this job to become a monk
in the monastery of St. Sabas outside of Jerusalem. He spent his
most productive years as a monk, but was ordained a priest later.
After his death he has been canonized as a saint and was declared a
doctor of the church.

## Iconoclast Controversy

In 726, Emperor Leo III ordered the destruction of a bronze icon of
Christ that stood over the doors of the imperial palace. This set
off in earnest the iconography controversy that culminated in
Nicaea II in 787 and later the final restoration of icons in 843
still celebrated today as the Triumph of Orthodoxy by the Eastern
Church. John of Damascus weighed in on this controversy in at least
three works in four years. John defended the making and using of
images by using the fact that the invisible God had become visible
in Jesus Christ. He appeared in flesh, and can thus be imaged. He
was able to critique Emperor Leo the third because by this point
the Byzantine Empire did not extend into the Middle East. John
effectively worked under the protection of the Islamic leaders.
John often backed up his arguments with quotations from the fathers
of the church in earlier ages. He did this to show how the position
of using and allowing images was one that was entrenched in the
history of the church. Thus, Leo III and his supporters were not
following the church, but rather overthrowing the tradition laid
down by the fathers. John of Damascus and other supporters of icons
were called iconophils while those who supported the destruction of
the images were called iconoclasts. The Western church generally
sided with John and the other iconophils by opposing Leo’s
appointments to the Patriarch of Constantinople and calling a
counsel that anathematized anyone who opposed the practice of
making and using images. Leo’s son, Constantine V, followed in his
father’s footsteps and responded to the attacks of the popes by
calling a counsel of his own, the Counsel of Hieria. Here
opposition to icons became the official position and anathemas were
given out to those who supported icons. John of Damascus was dead
by the time this counsel met, but he was singled out by the
[Counsel of Hieria](index.php?title=Counsel_of_Hieria&action=edit&redlink=1 "Counsel of Hieria (page does not exist)")
for special condemnation. After the Empress Irene came to the
throne, another council was called in 787. This council became the
[Second Council of Nicaea](index.php?title=Second_Council_of_Nicaea&action=edit&redlink=1 "Second Council of Nicaea (page does not exist)")
where John of Damascus and his views were approved. The theology of
iconography defended and set forth by John of Damascus is still the
position of both Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches
today^[[1]](#note-0)^.

## ther Notable beliefs

John of Damascus was not just a hero to the Eastern Orthodox
Church, but was respected in the West as well. When it came to the
issue of the day that divided the East and the West, namely the
[filoque](index.php?title=Filoque&action=edit&redlink=1 "Filoque (page does not exist)")
clause inserted into the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed"), John tried to take a
middling position. The West held that the Spirit proceeded from the
Father and the Son, while the East preferred the original phrase
the Spirit proceeded from the Father and left the Son out
completely. John tried to find middle ground in this growing
dispute by offering up a solution. He was willing to go as far as
saying the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, but he
would not say The Spirit was from the Father and the
Son^[[2]](#note-1)^.
