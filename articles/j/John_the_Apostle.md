**John the Apostle**, according to the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), was the son of
Zebedee, and the brother of
[James](James,_son_of_Zebedee "James, son of Zebedee"). One
tradition gives his mother's name as Salome. They originally were
fishermen with their father in the Lake of Genesareth. He was first
a disciple of
[John the Baptist](John_the_Baptist "John the Baptist"), then a
disciple of [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), and later
was named one of the twelve [Apostles](Apostle "Apostle").

John is traditionally held to be the author of five books of the
New Testament: The [Gospel](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John")
bearing his name, the three
[epistles](First_Epistle_of_John "First Epistle of John") bearing
his name, and the
[Book of Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation") (the
Revelation of Jesus Christ).

[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") and
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox") tradition
says that he and Mary (the mother of Jesus) moved to Ephesus, where
both eventually died. Many scholars question this, especially due
to the advanced age which Mary would have reached by this time.
Some believe, however, that there is support for the idea that John
did go to Ephesus and from there wrote the three epistles
attributed to him. John also was allegedly banished by the Roman
authorites to the Greek island of Patmos, where it is believed he
wrote the
[Book of Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation")
around A. D. 95. Some believe his tomb is located at Sel√ßuk, a
small town in the vicinity of Ephesus.

It is generally believed that in his later years John mentored
[Polycarp](Polycarp "Polycarp"), who later became Bishop of Smyrna.
The Roman Catholic Church also associates
[Ignatius of Antioch](Ignatius_of_Antioch "Ignatius of Antioch")
with him.
