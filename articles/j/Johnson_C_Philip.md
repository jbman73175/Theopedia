**Johnson C. Philip** (b. 1954) is a Christian apologist and author
of more than 50 books and 2500 articles in defense of the Christian
faith. He is also the founder of Trinity School of Apologetics and
Theology, which offers masters and doctoral programs in Christian
apologetics through distance education.

Born and raised in India, Philip developed an interest in books,
science and evolution in particular. However, as he studied
evolution, he thought it difficult to resolve many of the
evolutionary theories and explanation with empirical observations.
He developed an interest in creation science, and since devoted his
efforts to Christian apologetics and creationism.
