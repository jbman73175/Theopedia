The **Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification** is a
document created and agreed upon by the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
(RCC) and the Lutheran World Federation.

The Lutheran World Federation submitted the draft to 124 Lutheran
member churches and obtained responses from eighty–nine—eighty
favorable, five opposed, and four mixed. In the light of the
official reactions and private theological critiques, the text was
revised to produce the final version of 1997. On June 16, 1998 the
governing council of the Lutheran World Federation in Geneva,
Switzerland, unanimously approved the Joint
Declaration.^[[1]](#note-0)^
The RCC Council for Promoting Christian Unity later responded with
criticisms on June 25, 1998. ^[[2]](#note-1)^ Prior to this
statement, Lutherans and Roman Catholics interacted and in 1983
agreed to what was known as the Common Statement. ^[[3]](#note-2)^

The World Methodist Council accepted the statement on July 23,
2006. ^[[4]](#note-3)^
