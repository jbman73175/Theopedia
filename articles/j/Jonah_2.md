Chapter 2 of the ***Book of Jonah*** finds
[Jonah](index.php?title=Jonah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jonah (page does not exist)")
inside the belly of the fish for three days and nights,
[praying](Prayer "Prayer") fervently that he may live and serve the
[Lord](index.php?title=Lord&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lord (page does not exist)").
Salvation comes from the Lord, Jonah realizes, and he is spat out
of the fish onto dry land.

## Text of *Jonah*, chapter 2

*The text is from the Authorized (King James) Version of the Bible*

2:1 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's
belly,

2:2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD,
and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou
heardest my voice.

2:3 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas;
and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves
passed over me.

2:4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again
toward thy holy temple.

2:5 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth
closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.

2:6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her
bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from
corruption, O LORD my God.

2:7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my
prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.

2:8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

2:9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving;
I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.

2:10 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah
upon the dry land.
