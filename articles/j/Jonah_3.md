being ordered again to
[Nineveh](index.php?title=Nineveh&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nineveh (page does not exist)")
to preach against the wickedness of the inhabitants of that ancient
[Mesopotamian](index.php?title=Mesopotamian&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mesopotamian (page does not exist)")
city; [God](God "God") will bring about its destruction within
forty days. All of the inhabitants, from the least of them to the
king, repent of their evil, and sit in sackcloth and ashes, crying
out to God in repentance, staying God's judgment.
