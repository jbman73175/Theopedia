## Biographical sketch

Edwards was born in East Windsor, Connecticut, to Timothy Edwards,
pastor of East Windsor, and Esther Edwards. The only son in a
family of eleven children, he entered Yale in September, 1716 when
he was not yet thirteen and graduated four years later (1720) as
valedictorian.^[[1]](#note-BDE202)^ He received his Masters three
years later.

As a youth, Edwards was unable to accept the Calvinist
[sovereignty of God](Sovereignty_of_God "Sovereignty of God"). He
once wrote, "From my childhood up my mind had been full of
objections against the doctrine of God's sovereignty… It used to
appear like a horrible doctrine to me."^[[1]](#note-BDE202)^
However, in 1721 he came to the conviction, one he called a
"delightful conviction." He was meditating on 1 Timothy 1:17, and
later remarked, "As I read the words, there came into my soul, and
was as it were diffused through it, a sense of the glory of the
Divine Being; a new sense, quite different from any thing I ever
experienced before… I thought with myself, how excellent a Being
that was, and how happy I should be, if I might enjoy that God, and
be rapt up to him in heaven; and be as it were swallowed up in him
for ever!"^[[2]](#note-0)^ From that point on, Edwards delighted in
the sovereignty of God. Edwards later recognized this as his
[conversion](Conversion "Conversion") to Christ.

In 1727 he was ordained minister at Northampton and assistant to
his maternal grandfather, Solomon Stoddard. He was a student
minister, not a visiting pastor, his rule being thirteen hours of
study a day. In the same year, he married Sarah Pierpont, then age
seventeen, daughter of James Pierpont (1659–1714), a founder of
Yale, originally called the *Collegiate School*. In total, Jonathan
and Sarah had eleven children.

Solomon Stoddard died on February 11th, 1729, leaving to his
grandson the difficult task of the sole ministerial charge of one
of the largest and wealthiest congregations in the colony.

Throughout his time in Northampton his preaching brought remarkable
religious revivals. Jonathan Edwards was a key figure in what has
come to be called the
[First Great Awakening](Great_Awakening "Great Awakening") of the
1730s and 1740s.

Yet, tensions flamed as Edwards would not continue his
grandfather's practice of open [communion](Communion "Communion").
Stoddard, his grandfather, believed that communion was a
"converting ordinance." Surrounding congregations had been
convinced of this, and as Edwards became more convinced that this
was harmful, his public disagreement with the idea caused his
dismissal in 1750.

Edwards then moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and then a
frontier settlement, where he ministered to a small congregation
and served as missionary to the Housatonic Indians. There, having
more time for study and writing, he completed his celebrated work,
*The Freedom of the Will* (1754).

Edwards was elected president of the College of New Jersey (later
Princeton University) in early 1758. He was a popular choice, for
he had been a friend of the College since its inception and was the
most eminent American philosopher-theologian of his time. On March
22, 1758, he died of fever at the age of fifty-four following
experimental inoculation for smallpox and was buried in the
President's Lot in the Princeton cemetery beside his son-in-law,
Aaron Burr.

## The New England Theology

New England Theology is a school of theology originating from
Edwards' writings and associated with New England Congregationalism
beginning in the later 1700's. This school of theological thought
went through several stages, including the New Divinity espoused by
Joseph Bellamy (1719 - 1790) and Samuel Hopkins (1721 - 1803) as
well as the later New Haven theology espoused by Nathaniel W Taylor
(1786 - 1858). It became prominent in the early 1800's and rapidly
declined following the Civil War.^[[3]](#note-1)^

Some proponents of this New Divinity strayed from orthodox
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") with respect to the
[atonement](Atonement_of_Jesus "Atonement of Jesus"). They
gradually moved to what is called the
[Governmental theory of atonement](Governmental_theory_of_atonement "Governmental theory of atonement")
normally associated with [Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism").
While Edwards never personally held this view, some have argued
that it is a logical conclusion from some of his writings.

"Modifications made in the New England theology by Hopkins and
Bellamy were subtle ones. Their successors moved more obviously
beyond the teaching of Edwards. Timothy Dwight (1752 - 1817),
Edwards's grandson and president of Yale College, took a broader
view of human abilities in salvation and emphasized more the
reasonable nature of the Christian faith. Jonathan Edwards, Jr.
(1745 - 1801), who had studied with Joseph Bellamy, extended
Bellamy's idea of a
[governmental atonement](Governmental_theory_of_atonement "Governmental theory of atonement")
and also placed a stronger emphasis on the law of God for the
Christian life. Both he and Dwight continued the general trend to
view sin as an accumulation of actions rather than primarily a
state of being issuing in evil deeds."^[[4]](#note-2)^
