**Joseph**, son of [Jacob](Jacob "Jacob")^[[1]](#note-0)^ and
grandson of
[Isaac](index.php?title=Isaac&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isaac (page does not exist)"),
grew up as the favored child^[[2]](#note-1)^ by his father. This
favoritism rose from a very divided household with Jacob having
multiple wives. Jacob favored Joseph because he had borne him from
[Rachel](Rachel "Rachel"), his favorite wife. Joseph's brothers
became jealous of their father's favoritism of him. When Joseph
came to his brothers with dreams that he had received from the Lord
concerning his own future, they hated him all the more because the
dreams had his brothers in subjection to him. He was eventually
sold into slavery by his brothers. Through God's
providence,^[[3]](#note-2)^ he eventually rose to power in
[Egypt](Egypt "Egypt") because of his God-given ability to
interpret dreams, and specifically two dreams that troubled
[Pharaoh](index.php?title=Pharaoh&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pharaoh (page does not exist)")
(Gen 37, 39-50). Joseph's story significantly exemplifies a man of
faith^[[4]](#note-3)^ and presents an example of resisting
[temptation](index.php?title=Temptation&action=edit&redlink=1 "Temptation (page does not exist)")
(Gen 39).
