Josephus
**Josephus** (c. 37 â€“ c. 100 A.D.), also known as Flavius Josephus,
was a 1st century Jewish historian and apologist of priestly and
royal ancestry who survived and recorded the Destruction of
Jerusalem in 70 A.D. His works give an important insight into
first-century Judaism.

In the war between the Jews and the Romans of 66-70, Josephus was a
Jewish general charged with defending Galilee against the Roman
legions. After he had been defeated, he defected to his enemies,
and advised the Roman general
[Vespasian](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian "wikipedia:Vespasian").
When Vespasian became emperor, Josephus began his career as
historian, trying to explain Judaism to the Greeks and Romans. His
most important works are the *Jewish War*, the
*Jewish Antiquities*, an Autobiography, and an apology of Judaism
called *Against the Greeks* (or *Against Apion*). As a Roman
citizen, he took the name Flavius Josephus. He apparently died
about 100 A.D., at more than sixty years old.
