## Biographical sketch

He initially intended to pursue legal studies aimed at a political
career and began studies at Kellogg College in Michigan. As an
[atheist](Atheism "Atheism") at college he decided to prepare a
paper that would examine the historical evidence of the Christian
faith in order to disprove it. However he converted to Christianity
and subsequently enrolled at
[Wheaton College](Wheaton_College "Wheaton College"), Illinois,
where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree. He went on to receive
his M.Div from
[Talbot Theological Seminary](Talbot_School_of_Theology "Talbot School of Theology")
of [Biola University](Biola_University "Biola University"), La
Mirada, California.

In 1982 McDowell was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by
the Simon Greenleaf School of Law, in recognition of his ministry
and writings. McDowell was also a visiting lecturer at that school
in the 1980s.

Most of McDowell's writings have been
[apologetic](Apologetics "Apologetics") in nature, addressing
challenges posed by non-Christians. His apologetic methodology can
be deduced from his writings and clearly stands within the
evidentialist tradition of Christian apologetics -- presenting
positive arguments to commend belief in Christ by emphasising
historical and legal proofs to establish the authenticity of the
biblical texts and the divinity of Christ. His evidentialist
approach to apologetics is similar to that of apologists such as
John Warwick Montgomery, Norman Geisler, Gleason Archer, and Gary
Habermas.
