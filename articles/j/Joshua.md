*This is the Biblical character Joshua. For the canonical book of the Old Testament, see [Book of Joshua](Book_of_Joshua "Book of Joshua")*
**Joshua** ([Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew") **Yehosh√∫a**) was the first
leader of the tribes of [Israel](Israel "Israel") after
[Moses](Moses "Moses"). Moses personally granted this right to
Joshua in the presence of all Israel before his death on Mount Nebo
with God's blessing.

"Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all
Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people
into the land that the LORD swore to their forefathers to give
them, and you must divide it among them as their inheritance. (8)
The LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he will
never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be
discouraged." (Deu. 31:7-8, NIV).

## Early years and apprenticeship under Moses

Joshua was born during Israel's period of slavery in
[Egypt](Egypt "Egypt") as the son of
[Nun](index.php?title=Nun&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nun (page does not exist)"),
a descendant of
[Ephraim](index.php?title=Ephraim&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ephraim (page does not exist)").
His original name was Hoshea, but was later changed by Moses to
Joshua.

## Joshua as military commander

Joshua led Israel's campaign to conquer the land of Canaan, having
already established his military credentials by his leadership of
Israel's victory over the Amalekites in the Sinai peninsula (Ex.
17:8-13). Joshua's military leadership and tactics were direct from
God, and the book of Joshua is very clear on this point. "(2) Then
the LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have delivered Jericho into your
hands, along with its king and its fighting men. (3) March around
the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. (4)
Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams' horns in front of the
ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with
the priests blowing the trumpets. (5) When you hear them sound a
long blast on the trumpets, have all the people give a loud shout;
then the wall of the city will collapse and the people will go up,
every man straight in." (Jos. 6:2-5, NIV)

After the military campaign was complete and he had granted land to
the tribes of Judah, Ephraim, and half of Manasseh "Joshua removed
the Tabernacle and the Ark from Gilgal to Shiloh, and took up his
residence there. Here he continued the work of apportioning the
rest of the land by lot according to the
families".[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua)

## Joshua as Israel's leader

Joshua played a significant role in the history of Israel by
bringing about the partial fulfilment of the
[Mosaic covenant](Mosaic_covenant "Mosaic covenant") by
establishing the nation of Israel in Canaan. He also presided over
the division of the lands into the hands of the tribes of Israel.
Under Joshua's leadership Israel established itself as the dominant
power in the region, Egypt and Babylon could not maintain a
standing presence in the region and the Assyrian invasion was
centuries away (Zondervan, 2002). Some scholars attribute the
success of the nation of Israel during Joshua's time leading them
to his leadership ability and God's blessing upon him. Joshua's
approach in leading Israel was different from Moses, and this is
especially evident in the campaign to conquer Canaan.

## Joshua's death

Joshua lived to be "old and well advanced in years" (Jos. 23:1,
NIV) and was buried at Timnath Serah (which he apportioned to
himself) in the hill country of Ephraim (Jos. 24:30).
