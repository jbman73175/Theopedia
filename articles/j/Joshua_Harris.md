## Biography

Harris is the original author of the widely-circulated
inspirational short story
"[The Room](http://joshharris.com/theroom/theroommain.htm)," which
originally appeared in *New Attitude*, a quarterly magazine for
homeschooled teenagers he published from 1995 to 1997. ("The Room"
was later reprinted in *I Kissed Dating Goodbye* and is frequently
misattributed to an anonymous author, or to deceased student Brian
Keith Moore of Teays Valley, West Virginia.)

In 1997, Harris published his first book,*I Kissed Dating Goodbye*,
advocating a Christian approach to dating and courtship. Sequels
included *Boy Meets Girl*, in part describing his engagement to his
wife, Shannon, released in 2000, and
*Not Even a Hint: Guarding Your Heart Against Lust* in 2003.

In 1998, he moved to Gaithersburg to serve as a pastoral intern
under [C.J. Mahaney](C.J._Mahaney "C.J. Mahaney"), then senior
pastor of Covenant Life Church, the founding church of
[Sovereign Grace Ministries](Sovereign_Grace_Ministries "Sovereign Grace Ministries").
The next year Harris hosted the first annual New Attitude
Conference in Baltimore, which he ran until assuming the role of
senior pastor in 2004.

Harris' brothers, twins Alex and Brett, are the hosts of the
[The Rebelution](http://www.therebelution.com/), which includes a
blog proclaiming a biblical worldview for teenagers.
