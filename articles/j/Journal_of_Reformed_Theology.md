**Journal of Reformed Theology** is published three times a year.
It was envisioned in 2005 by the International Reformed Theological
Institute (IRTI); first published the week after Easter in 2007.
Faculty of the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam have also given the
journal editorial assistance along with editors from South Africa,
Korea, the USA, Netherlands, and Belgium. The journal's
editor-in-chief is Eddy van der Borght.^[[1]](#note-0)^ The journal
intends to focus "on living and contextual theology" instead of
being "an instrument of a merely confessional Reformed theology."
The first issue includes articles by Diane Stinton—her
*Jesus of Africa* was published in 2004—and Diego Irarrazaval—a
Roman-Catholic priest who works in Chile.

The IRTI will continue to publish its own bulletin.
