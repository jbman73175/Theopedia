Christians should always find reasons to be joyful. There are many
ways to define joy. Joy isn't just a smile or a laugh. Joy is
something that is deep within and doesn't leave quickly. When we
have the joy of the Lord, we'll know it and so will others. Since
joy is given by God and something that He wants us to have, we need
to be joyful! In addition to being joyful, we should let others
have their joy and not bring them down when they are excited about
good things.
*The only thing worse than not having joy is stealing someone else's.*^[[1]](#note-JG)^

Spending eternity in Heaven with God, the saints and the angels is
something incredible! Ask for joy! If we can't find reasons to be
joyful, our perspective must change. God lets us have blessings
every day. We should be able to see them and thank God for them.
Additionally, we should ask for God's blessings! Some think they
should be blessed with joy automatically, but God's Word says "you
have not because you do not ask." (John 15:16) ^[[1]](#note-JG)^
God's Holy Spirit produces joy. Joy is a product of
Christ-likeness. When we seek God through His Word and prayer, we
will receive joy! Thank God that joy is something He wants us to
have!

Joy is the second "fruit of the Spirit," according to Galatians
5:22 "But the fruit of the Spirit is...joy...."

Reading the scriptures will bring us joy! "And these things we
write to you that your joy may be full." (1 John 1:4) We will also
see where the Bible gives us specific times to be joyful. Lastly,
I've listed ways that God has given me joy! If you're lacking, pray
and try some! Enjoy this lesson and God bless you!
