Joyce Meyer
**Joyce Meyer**, born in 1943, is a popular
[Pentecostal](Pentecostal "Pentecostal") preacher living outside of
St. Louis, MO, who has been in fulltime ministry since 1980. She is
a best-selling author in the Christian market, and her books cover
everything from America's Christian heritage to weight-loss. But
she is perhaps best known from her radio and television program,
*Life in the Word*, both of which are broadcast nationally and
internationally. Meyer shares the platform from time to time with
[Word of Faith](Word_of_Faith "Word of Faith") teachers like, for
example, Kenneth Copeland, Jesse Duplantis, Benny Hinn, and T.D.
Jakes.
