**Judaism** is the ancient religion of [Israel](Israel "Israel")
carried forth by their descendants. The name derives from
[Judah](index.php?title=Judah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Judah (page does not exist)")
- the principle faithful kingdom after the division of the kingdom
of [David](David "David"). Judaism is a monotheistic religion based
upon principles and ethics embodied in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh),
as further explored and explained in the Talmud and other texts.
According to Jewish tradition, Judaism began with the Covenant
between God and Abraham.

Modern Judaism is generally divided into four denominations:
Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism (known as Masorti Judaism
outside of the United States and Canada), Reform Judaism (called
Liberal or Progressive in many countries), and Reconstructionist
Judaism. Each denomination believes in the God of the Old Testament
but, of course, does not believe that Jesus of Nazereth was the
Messiah, much less the Son of God.
