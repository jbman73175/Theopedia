**Judas Iscariot** was, according to the New Testament, one of the
twelve original disciples of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"), and the one
who is said to have betrayed him. Judas is mentioned in the
[synoptic Gospels](Synoptic_Gospels "Synoptic Gospels"), the
[Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") and at the
beginning of
[Acts of the Apostles](Acts_of_the_Apostles "Acts of the Apostles").
The name Judas (*Ioudas*) is the Greek form of Judah, a proper name
frequently found in both the Old and the New Testament. To
distinguish him from Judas, the son of James (Luke 6:16), this
Judas is usually associated with the surname Iscariot, which is
likely Hebrew meaning "a man of Kerioth," a city of Judah.

According to the account given in the Gospels, he carried the
disciples' money box and betrayed Jesus for a bribe of "thirty
pieces of silver" by identifying him with a kiss to arresting
soldiers of the High Priest
[Caiphas](index.php?title=Caiphas&action=edit&redlink=1 "Caiphas (page does not exist)"),
who then turned Jesus over to
[Pontius Pilate](Pontius_Pilate "Pontius Pilate")'s soldiers.

There are two different NT references to the end of Judas' life:

-   The [Gospel of Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew")
    (27:3-10) says that, after Jesus' arrest by the Roman authorities
    (but before his execution), the guilt-ridden Judas returned the
    bribe to the priests and committed suicide by hanging himself. The
    priests could not return the money to the treasury so they used it
    to buy a plot of ground in order to bury strangers.

-   The
    [Acts of the Apostles](Acts_of_the_Apostles "Acts of the Apostles")
    (1:18) says that Judas used the bribe (or Judas' returned bribe was
    used) to buy a field, into which he fell headlong, burst open in
    the middle and all his bowels gushed out. This field is called
    Akeldama or Field Of Blood. Acts 1 goes on to describe how his
    place among the apostles was subsequently filled by Matthias.

There have been several attempts through history to rectify the
apparent discrepancy between the two accounts, and some depictions
in art portray Judas hanging himself, but with his stomach
exploding as he does so.
