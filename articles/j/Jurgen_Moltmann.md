## Christianity in the POW camps

In 1944, his secular education was interrupted when he was drafted
by the German army. Moltmann was sent to the front lines in the
Belgian forest. He surrendered in 1945 to the first British soldier
he met. For the next few years (1945-1947), he was confined as a
prisoner of war and moved from camp to camp.

His experience as a POW had a powerful impact on his life, as it
was in the camps that he had time to reflect upon the devastating
nature of the Second World War, developing a great sense of
remorse. It was also in the camps that Moltmann met Christian
chaplains, was given the New Testament and Psalms to read, and had
his first introduction to Christian theology. He gradually felt
more and more identification with and reliance on the Christian
faith. Moltmann later claimed, "I didn't find Christ, he found
me."

In July of 1946, he was transferred for the last time to Northern
Camp, a British prison located near Nottingham, UK. The camp was
operated by the YMCA and here Moltmann met many students of
theology. At Northern Camp, he discovered Reinhold Niebuhr's Nature
and Destiny of Man--it was the first book of theology he had ever
read, and Moltmann claimed it had a huge impact on his life.

## After the war

In 1947, he and a group of other POW's attended the first postwar
Student Christian Movement in Swanwick, a conference center near
Derby. What happened there affected him very deeply. Moltmann
returned to Germany in 1948 at age 22 to pursue theological
training. He received his doctorate from the University of
Gottingen, under the direction of Otto Weber in 1952. From 1952 to
1957 Moltmann was the pastor of the Evangelical Church of
Bremen-Wasserhorst.

## Theology

As a prisoner of war in a British camp during World War II,
Moltmann observed that his fellow prisoners who had hope fared the
best. After the war, it seemed to him Christianity was ignoring the
hope offered in its promise of a future life.

Moltmann is known as "one of the leading proponents of the theology
of hope. He believes that God's promise to act in the future is
more important than the fact that he has acted in the past. What is
implied by this focus on the future, however, is not withdrawal
from the world in the hope that a better world will somehow evolve,
but active participation in the world in order to aid in the coming
of that better world." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

The most influential work by Moltmann is his *Theology of Hope*,
published in English in 1967. Moltmann proposes that Christian hope
should be the central motivating factor in the life and thought of
the church and of each Christian. For Moltmann, the whole creation
longs for the renewal by the "God of Hope." Empowered by hope, the
Christian's response should therefore involve: mission of the
church to all nations, the hunger for righteousness in the world,
and love for the true life of the imperiled and impaired creation.

Although Moltmann is perhaps most conspicuous, he is not the only
theologian of hope. His theology is in concert with that of
[Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran") theologian
[Wolfhart Pannenberg](Wolfhart_Pannenberg "Wolfhart Pannenberg"),
who has become quite well known in the United States since the late
60s and in whose essay "Dogmatic Theses on the Doctrine of
Revelation" is found a similar emphasis on understanding of all
reality in terms of the eschaton.
