"God does not always act with justice. Sometimes He acts with
mercy. Mercy is not justice, but neither is it injustice. Injustice
violates righteousness. Mercy manifests kindness and grace and does
no violence to righteousness. We may see non-justice in God, which
is mercy, but we never see injustice in God." -
[R.C. Sproul](R.C._Sproul "R.C. Sproul"), *The Holiness of God*, p.
