**Justification** is the [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") that
[God](God "God") pardons, accepts, and declares a sinner to be
"just" on the basis of Christ's righteousness (Rom 3:24-26; 4:25;
5:15-21) which results in God's peace (Rom 5:1), His Spirit (Rom
8:4), and [salvation](Salvation "Salvation"). Justification is by
grace through faith in [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ")
apart from all works and merit of the sinner (cf. Rom 1:18-3:28).

## The act of justification

### One-time act

Justification is a legal act, wherein God deems the sinner
righteous on the basis of Christ's righteousness. Unlike
[Sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification"), Justification is
not a process, but is a one-time act, complete and definitive.

The word *justification* is not always used in the same sense. Some
even speak of a fourfold justification as a justification from
eternity, a justification from the resurrection, a justification in
final judgment – as these are all
true.[[1]](http://www.seeking4truth.com/21.htm)

### Double imputation

God's act of justification may be seen to involve a double
[imputation](Imputation "Imputation"). On the one hand, the sin and
guilt of the believer are imputed to Christ. On the other hand, the
righteousness of Christ is imputed to the believer, whereby he is
declared righteous.

*See main page: [Double imputation](Double_imputation "Double imputation")*
### Forgiveness and adoption

Justification is seen in two parts: (1) The sinner is forgiven on
the basis of Christ's righteousness. The pardon does not merely
cover sins already committed – but reaches to all sins. (2) The
sinner is adopted as a child of God. God places them within his
household, giving them all the rights of heirs and children (Rom
8:17, 1 Peter 1:4).

## Helpful quotes

-   **Q. 33. What is justification?**

A. Justification is an act of God's free grace, wherein he
pardoneth all our sins, and accepteth us as righteous in his sight,
only for the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and received by
faith alone. Westminster Shorter Catechism Question 33

-   "The relationship of entailment between A [faith] and B [works]
    may be any of several kinds. A entails B if A and B are identical;
    If A then B is a valid inference by the law of identity. By
    causation, A entails B if A is a necessary and sufficient condition
    of B: If A then B. A. Therefore B” is a valid inference by modus
    ponens. By inclusion, A entails B if all A are B, even if not all B
    are A: All A are B. C is A. Therefore C is B is a valid inference
    by modus ponens. [With regard to faith and works, what matters] is
    whether the entailment is that of identity, cause, or inclusion.
    The first equates faith and works and destroys the whole Biblical
    teaching of justification by faith alone apart from the works of
    the law (Romans 3:28). The third subsumes works under faith and
    likewise destroys sola fide. Only the second maintains the Biblical
    distinction between faith and works and the Biblical doctrine that
    works are the necessary consequence of faith and so upholds the
    Biblical teaching of justification by faith alone apart from the
    works of the law." Calvin Beisner, Norman Shepherd and the Faith
    that Justifies, Knox Theological Seminary Chapel, October 22, 2002
