**Justin Martyr** (c. 100 - c. 165), born in modern day Palestine,
was an early [Christian](Christianity "Christianity")
[apologist](Apologetics "Apologetics") and
[martyr](Martyr "Martyr"). "He claimed to have been raised a
Gentile, and in his search for truth he studied with the Stoics,
Aristotelians, Pythagoreans, and Platonists. Impressed by the
devotion of Christian martyrs, he was eventually converted to
Christianity by an old Christian who taught him about the Hebrew
prophets. According to Justin, Christianity filled the highest
aspirations of Platonic philosophy and was, therefore, the 'true
philosophy.'"^[[1]](#note-0)^ In his *First Apology*, Justin argued
that there were traces of Christian truth that could be found in
pagan writings. He held to a doctrine of the *logos spermatikis*,
meaning 'seed-bearing word', which asserted that God had prepared a
way to his final [revelation](Revelation "Revelation") in
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") through hints of truth found within
classical philosophy.

"During the reign of Antoninus Pius (131-161) he taught in Rome,
influencing [Tatian](Tatian "Tatian") and
[Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus"). He was one of the first to
consistently use Greek philosophy (especially Platonism) to explain
Christian doctrine, thereby setting himself in dramatic opposition
to [Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian"), who would ask "what does
Athens [representing the academy, or philosophy] have to do with
Jerusalem [representing the churhc]?" The Logos (God immanent), he
believed, was "other than" the Father (God transcendent) in number,
but not in will. Three of his writings, *The First Apology*,
*The Second Apology*, and *The Dialogue with Trypho, the Jew*,
exist in complete form, though there is some question about the
precise relationship between the First and Second Apology. Justin,
a central figure in the history of second century Christian
thought, suffered martyrdom early in the reign of Marcus Aurelius
under Junius Rusticus (prefect 162-168)." ^[[2]](#note-1)^

Justin is an excellent example of an early theologian who sought to
relate and explain the gospel through Greek philosophical
concepts.

## Works

In the writings of the early church we have three documents
existant from Justin Martyr—*The First Apology*;
*The Second Apology*; and *The Dialogue with Trypho*. There is
account according to Eusebius of five more works from the pen of
Justin which have been lost. The apologies seek to defend the
poistion of the Christians in the kingdom against unfair
persecution and misconceptions. Justin seeks to dispel the myths
surrounding Christians such as cannibalism or licentious sex but to
prove these he goes on to write vastly on the Christian faith. Upon
reading the two apologies one will see that Justin is more focused
on quoting Scriptures and Christian truths rather than
sophisticated arguments or philosophical ideals to defend early
Christians. *The Dialogue with Trypho* was written later (c.a. 150
AD) and is an account of a debate between Justin and Trypho a Jew.
In this work one sees the Old Testament Scriptures saturate even
more of the writing than in Justin's Apologies. It is a work that
is decidedly Christocentric and exegetical.
