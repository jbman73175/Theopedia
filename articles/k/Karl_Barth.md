## Early life and education

Karl Barth was born in Basel, Switzerland and spent his early years
growing up in Bern where his father taught at the university. Barth
began his studies in Bern in 1904 where he was introduced to
[Kant](Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant"), whose
*Critique of Practical Reason* he called 'the first book that
really moved me as a student'.^[[1]](#note-0)^ Barth went on to
study at Berlin, a center of
[Protestant liberalism](Theological_liberalism "Theological liberalism"),
later studying at Tübingen and finally in Marburg in 1908. While at
Marburg,
[Wilhelm Herrmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Herrmann "w:Wilhelm Herrmann")^[[2]](#note-1)^
had a great influence on Barth. After Marburg, Barth spent ten
years (1911 - 1921) as a pastor. This had a profound impact on his
theology as "Barth's liberal assurances were initially undermined
by his exposure to the Swiss social democratic movement... The
outbreak of the Great War further disillusioned him... most of his
former teachers signed a declaration of support for the
Kaiser."^[[3]](#note-2)^ Barth described his experience:

An entire world of theological exegesis, ethics, dogmatics, and
preaching, which up to that point I had accepted as basically
credible, was thereby shaken to the foundations, and with it
everything which flowed at that time from the pens of the German
theologians.^[[4]](#note-3)^
Barth returned to Scripture, especially studying the book of
[Romans](Romans "Romans") in 1916 which resulted in his commentary,
first published in 1919.^[[5]](#note-4)^ His commentary resulted in
a new-found prominence in Germany.

As a result, Barth was offered a position as Honorary Professor of
Reformed Theology in Göttingen.^[[6]](#note-5)^ Teaching at
Göttingen from 1921 - 1925, he later held posts at Münster
(1925–1930) and Bonn (1930–1935). After his ejection from the Bonn
faculty for resistance to the growing National Socialist movement,
he returned to Basel, where he would teach until his retirement.
Other key points involve Barth's first (and later abandoned) volume
of the *Christian Dogmatics* (1927), his study of Anselm (1930),
the first volume of the *Church Dogmatics* (1932), his debate with
Emil Brunner over natural theology,^[[7]](#note-6)^ the
[Barmen Declaration](Barmen_Declaration "Barmen Declaration") of
1934, and his travel to Rome in 1966 to talk with those involved in
the Second Vatican Council among many other things. Barth retired
at the end of the winter semester of 1961-62, and his health began
to decline in 1964. Barth passed away on December 10th, 1968.

## Theological perspectives

It has been said that "a 'Barthian theology' is just as impossible
as an 'Einsteinian science', but just as there is a pre-Einsteinian
science and a post-Einsteinian science, so there is a pre-Barthian
and post-Barthian theology, for the contribution of Karl Barth to
theology is, like that of Albert Einstein to nature science, so
deep-going and fundamental that it marks one of the great eras of
advance in the whole history of the subject"^[[8]](#note-7)^

## *Church Dogmatics*

Barth's *Church Dogmatics* (CD) were written from his classroom
lectures in dogmatic theology. There are fourteen volumes as the
set has traditionally been published -- thirteen plus an index
volume. However, each of these is considered a "part-volume" within
the four volumes of the *Church Dogmatics*: volume 1 on the Word of
God, volume 2 on the doctrine of God, volume 3 on the doctrine of
Creation, and volume 4 on the doctrine of Reconciliation. The
standard citation form puts these volumes in Roman numerals,
followed by the part-volume number in Arabic numerals, as seen in
the chart below.

The Study Edition of the *Church Dogmatics*, as published by T&T
Clark in 2009, is broken up into 31 volumes, with references to the
original set of fourteen volumes and its standard page numbering.

The *Church Dogmatics* was never completed as originally planned.
Barth's death in 1968 left the work concluded by a fragment of the
planned part-volume IV/4, on Baptism. The remainder of the
manuscript was in the process of being edited at the time of his
death, and remained unpublished until 1981. The existing course of
four volumes (The Doctrine of the Word of God, The Doctrine of God,
The Doctrine of Creation, The Doctrine of Reconciliation) was to be
completed by a fifth volume following the trinitarian scheme set
out early in its course: The Doctrine of Redemption.
