Karl Rahner in 1975
**Karl Rahner**, (March 5, 1904 â€“ March 30, 1984) was one of the
most influential [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic")
theologians of the 20th century. He was born in Freiburg, Germany,
and died in Innsbruck, Austria. His theology influenced the Second
Vatican Council and is ground-breaking for a modern understanding
of Catholic faith. Written near the end of his life, Rahner's
*Foundations of Christian Faith* is the most developed and
systematic of his works, most of which was published in the form of
theological essays.

The basis for Rahner's theology is that all human beings have a
latent ("unthematic") experience of [God](God "God") in any
experiences of meaning or "transcendental experience." It is only
because of this proto-revelation that recognizing a specifically
special revelation (such as the Christian gospel) is possible.

The philosophical sources for Rahner's theology include
[Thomas Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas"), read from the
aspect of contemporary continental philosophy. Rahner attended
lectures by Heidegger in Freiburg.
