The term **kenosis** comes from the Greek word *kenoo*, translated
"emptied" in chapter 2 of Paul's letter to the Philippians:

"Who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard
equality with God a thing to be grasped, but **emptied** Himself,
taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness
of men." (Phil. 2:6-7 [NASB](NASB "NASB"))
What has come to be called "Kenotic theology" attempts to
understand the [incarnation](Incarnation "Incarnation") of the
second person of the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") in light of the
**kenosis** of Phillippians 2:7. Its aim is to solve some of the
supposed paradoxes arising from [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") having both
a divine nature and a human nature. For example, how could an
[all knowing](Omniscience_of_God "Omniscience of God")
[God](God "God") become a baby, how could God be tempted, or how
could Jesus (being God) not know the time of His return?

The danger comes when it is concluded that in the incarnation, the
second person of the Trinity took on human nature *and* gave up or
lost some of the
[divine attributes](Attributes_of_God "Attributes of God") -- such
that Jesus was not fully divine. The doctrine of the two natures of
Christ (known as the
[hypostatic union](Hypostatic_union "Hypostatic union")) maintains
that Jesus possessed a full undiminished human nature and a full
undiminished divine nature, which were not combined or confused
into some new nature but were added to each other forever (yet
remaining distinct) in the one person Jesus Christ.

The question regarding the kenosis comes to this -- What does it
mean when Scripture says Christ "emptied" Himself? Did Jesus cease
to be God during His earthly ministry? Certainly not, for deity
cannot stop being deity or He would never have been true deity to
begin with. Rather, the "emptying" is satisfactorily explained in
the subsequent words of the verse, taking note of the two
participles which grammatically modify and explain the verb: He
**emptied** himself, **taking** the form of a bond-servant, and
**being made** in the likeness of men. This emptying, in fact, was
done as the man Christ Jesus, and neither of these ideas
necessitates or implies the giving up of divine attributes.

Christianity maintains that Jesus did not "empty" himself of any of
his divinity in the incarnation, although it is true that his
divine attributes were *veiled*. When the Kenosis theory concludes
that Jesus is or was less than God (as has been the case in the
past), it is regarded as [heresy](Heresy "Heresy").
