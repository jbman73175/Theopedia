Kerney Thomas' prayer ministry
**Kerney Thomas** (b. Jan 19, 1956) is a
[Pentecostal](Pentecostal "Pentecostal") Televangelist who also
hosts a radio show in Houston, TX. Thomas "claims to be a member of
the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), the largest African American
pentecostal group in America, and serves as the first
administrative assistant under the leadership of Bobby R.
Henderson." ^[[1]](#note-0)^ His theology and practices have been
questioned by many and remain biblically suspect.


## False teachings

Thomas teaches that through the use of a "prayer handkerchief" and
"olive oil soap" a person can be guaranteed a way to make a miracle
manifest in someone's life. Furthermore, bathing in the "olive oil
soap" can cure people of AIDS, cancer, and common aches and pains.
^[[2]](#note-1)^ Thomas believes he is a
[prophet](Prophet "Prophet") similar to
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") prophets and thus
advises people to come to him first before they speak with their
pastor about an issue. ^[[3]](#note-2)^ He also asserts that his
viewers should send money to him and his ministry in exchange for
miracles, and that the greater the amount the greater the blessing.
