Vanhoozer's *The Drama of Doctrine* was named best book in theology
in the 2006
*[Christianity Today](Christianity_Today "Christianity Today")*
Book Awards. In this book, Vanhoozer proposes a way of doing
theology that corresponds to its subject matter:
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") is direction for the fitting
participation of the individual and the church in the ongoing
"theodrama," the reconciling action of the triune [God](God "God").
Theology is faith seeking understanding of the theodrama, but
understanding demands not only that we comprehend but that we also
perform the Scriptures, the script that forms and transforms the
people of God.

In his work
*Is There a Meaning in this Text? the Bible, the Reader, and the Morality of Literary Knowledge*,
Vanhoozer gives an in depth response to the challenges of
Deconstruction to
[biblical hermeneutics](Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics"). Primarily, he
engages the thinking of Derrida, but Fish and Rorty also receive
much attention. In doing so he lays out his own hermeneutical
proposal which applies not only to special biblical hermeneutics
but general hermeneutics as well. Vanhoozer develops a theory of
communicative action which, among other concepts, that relies
strongly on the speech-act theory of Austin. A biblical text is a
communicative act which involve locutions (the text itself),
illocutions (the stance of the author to the locution, i.e.
questioning, asserting, promising etc.) and perlocutions (the goals
that the author hopes to accomplish through the text). Among the
conclusions that Vanhoozer draws from viewing a text as a
communicative act are the involvement of the author, text and
reader in the process of interpretation. The intended meaning of
the author can be discerned to a certain degree from the text. The
text (langue and parole) is not an arbitrary "playground" but part
of a covenantal relationship between all people. As a result the
intention of the author can be adequately decoded. A third
consequence is that the reader/interpreter has a responsibility to
honor the intentions of the author and try to interpret the text in
a way which re-creates the author's intended meaning. This
responsibility is coupled with a freedom to determine the
significance in the context of the interpreter's community.
