The **King James Only Movement** accepts the
[King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version") (KJV)
as being the only legitimate [Bible](Bible "Bible") translation for
English speaking people.

The terms "King James Only" or "KJV-Only" are applied to those
holding a wide variety of [doctrinal](Doctrine "Doctrine") views,
some of which are conflicting. Some hold that the KJV is simply the
best translation of the preserved manuscripts, while others hold
the more extreme view that the KJV was actually "given by
inspiration of God" (2Tim. 3:16, KJV) and has more authority than
the original manuscripts.
