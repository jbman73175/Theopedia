The **King James Version** or **KJV**, which is known in Britain as
the **Authorised Version**, is an
[English translation of the Bible](English_translations_of_the_Bible "English translations of the Bible")
first published in 1611 by scholars of the
[Church of England](Anglicanism "Anglicanism"). Considered a
masterwork of medieval scholarship, the KJV has become the best
selling book in the history of the world and, perhaps more than any
other book or Bible translation, helped form modern Western
civilization.

## Attributes of the KJV

The King James Version is translated from the Received Text, also
known as the Textus Receptus. The version used by the translators
was the 1550 edition of Stephanus. The Received Text is very
similar to the Majority Text and Byzantine text type. The book of
Revelation has differences from these texts as much of it was taken
from the Latin Vulgate.

The King James Version most commonly available at bookstores is
based on the 1769 edition, which modernised the spelling of many of
the words in the original 1611 edition, but made very few changes
in vocabulary. Many contemporary King James Bibles have excised the
deuterocanonical books, or Apocrypha.
