The presence and coming of the **Kingdom of God** was the central
message of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). For example, "his teaching was
designed to show men how they might enter the Kingdom of God (Matt.
5:20; 7:21). His mighty works were intended to prove that the
Kingdom of God had come upon them (Matt. 12: 28). His parables
illustrated to His disciples the truth about the Kingdom of God
(Matt. 13:11). And when He taught His followers to pray, at the
heart of their petition were the words, "Thy kingdom come, thy will
be done on earth as it is in heaven" (Matt. 6:10). On the eve of
His death, He assured His disciples that He would yet share with
them the happiness and the fellowship of the Kingdom (Luke
22:22-30). And He promised that He would appear again. on the earth
in glory to bring the blessedness of the Kingdom to those for whom
it was prepared (Matt. 25:31, 34)." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

The term "Kingdom of God" occurs four times in
[Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew") (12:28; 19:24;
21:31; 21:43), fourteen times in
[Mark](Gospel_of_Mark "Gospel of Mark"), thirty-two times in
[Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke"), twice in the
[Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") (3:3, 5), six
times in [Acts](Acts "Acts"), eight times in Paul, and once in
[Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation") (12:10).
Matthew actually prefers the term "Kingdom of heaven" which he uses
over 20 times in his gospel.

While Matthew primarily uses the term “kingdom of heaven” and other
gospel writers (notably Luke) use the term “kingdom of God,” it is
clear that these two expressions mean exactly the same thing (e.g.
compare Matt. 5:3 with Luke 6:20). In the past some have tried to
maintain a distinction between the kingdom of heaven and the
kingdom of God;^[[2]](#note-1)^ however, the vast majority of
theologians today recognize the terms as
synonymous.^[[3]](#note-2)^

## Definitions

[Graeme Goldsworthy](Graeme_Goldsworthy "Graeme Goldsworthy") has
summarized a definition of the Kingdom of God as "God's people in
God's place under God's rule." ^[[4]](#note-3)^

[Anthony Hoekema](Anthony_Hoekema "Anthony Hoekema") has described
God's Kingdom as "the reign of God dynamically active in human
history through Jesus Christ, the purpose of which is the
redemption of his people from sin and from demonic powers, and the
final establishment of the new heavens and the new earth."

[George Eldon Ladd](George_Eldon_Ladd "George Eldon Ladd") notes
that "The primary meaning of both the Hebrew word *malkuth* in the
Old Testament and of the Greek word *basileia* in the New Testament
is the rank, authority and sovereignty exercised by a king. A
*basileia* may indeed be a realm over which a sovereign exercises
his authority; and it may be the people who belong to that realm
and over whom authority is exercised; but these are secondary and
derived meanings. First of all, a kingdom is the authority to rule,
the sovereignty of the king." ^[[6]](#note-5)^
