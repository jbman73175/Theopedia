The **knowability of God** is a topic in Christian theology that
deals with the degree to which [God](God "God") can be known by
mankind. Some religions contend that he cannot be known, sometimes
arguing that God is so unique from [humanity](Humanity "Humanity")
that it is absurd to think that finite humans can relate or know
him in *any* significant way. Christians, however, contend that
although we cannot fully know everything about God, since he has
chosen to [reveal himself](Revelation_of_God "Revelation of God")
to his creatures in a variety of ways we can know him personally,
meaningfully, and significantly, in a limited but ever-increasing
way throughout eternity.

## God cannot be known exhaustively

Scripture does reveal that God can never fully be known. The
Psalmist tells us that "Great is the LORD, and greatly to be
praised, and his greatness is unsearchable," (Psalm 145:3).
[Paul](Paul "Paul") adds to this idea, observing that "the Spirit
searches everything, even the depths of God," and later notes that,
"no one comprehends the things of God except the Spirit of God" (1
Corinthians 2:10-12). [David](David "David") further emphasizes
this when he says that, "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it
is high, I cannot attain it" (Psalm 139:6; cf. 17). This idea is
ultimately summed from the very mouth of God,

*For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts (Isaiah 55:8-9)*.
*Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! (Romans 11:33)*
## How God *can* be known

Although God cannot be known completely, we can know *true* things
about him. For example, we know that God is love (1 John 4:8), God
is light (1 John 1:5), God is spirit (John 4:24), and that God is
just or righteous (Romans 3:26). These aspects of God have been
revealed to us in Scripture. However, more than mere facts can be
known about God.

"Thus says the LORD: 'Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let
not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast
in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he
understands and knows me, that I am the LORD who practices
steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in
these things I delight, declares the LORD.'" (Jeremiah 9:23-24).
Scripture tells us that we can know more than facts about God - we
can actually know him as a personal being! Even more, what this
passage tells us is that our source of joy should come from knowing
God and not from our riches, wisdom, or might. Another significant
passage comes from the
[Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John"), "Now this is
eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus
Christ, whom you have sent," (John 17:3). John later writes in his
epistle, "I write to you, children, because you know the Father,"
(1 John 2:13). God can be known, and in knowing God we should take
great joy, for by knowing God, we can pray to him, hear him, and
commune in his presence.
