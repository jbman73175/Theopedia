The **L.A. Church of Christ** is the central organization operating
the cultic/sectarian group known as the International Church of
Christ (ICC). Its roots and beginnings go back to 1979 and in the
founding leadership by Kip McKean. The ICC was founded in Boston
and has therefore been called, "The Boston Movement".
