**L'Abri** (from the French word meaning *shelter*) is an
organization which operates evangelical Christian study centers in
7 countries and resource centers in 2 others. It was founded in
1955 by [Francis Schaeffer](Francis_Schaeffer "Francis Schaeffer")
and his wife Edith when they opened their alpine home in
Switzerland as a ministry to curious travelers and as a forum to
discuss philosophical and religious beliefs.

A L'Abri centre incorporates elements of a seminary (referring to
its visitors as students, but with no fixed "classes" or courses),
a commune (requiring students to help with cooking meals, cleaning,
and maintenance), and a "retreat" (lasting from one day to a whole
"term", usually 2-3 months). While at L'Abri, students meet
regularly with a member of staff to discuss issues, are recommended
resources from a library of books and recordings, and are
encouraged to pursue interests in art, music and literature.

Published current and former L'Abri staff include Francis and Edith
Schaeffer, [Greg Laughery](Greg_Laughery "Greg Laughery"), Jerram
Barrs, Wade Bradshaw, [Os Guinness](Os_Guinness "Os Guinness"),
Dick and Mardi Keyes, Ranald Macaulay, Hans Rookmaaker and Richard
Winter.
