Bishop Farrar-Amani is an anointed missionary, teacher and preacher
with an unquenchable yearning to reach every unreached, hurting and
downtrodden individual who has not accepted Jesus Christ as their
personal Savior. His passion and commitment to share in the
fulfillment of the Great Commission with the leading of the Holy
Spirit has led him to yield to a global mission and advance the
work of the Kingdom of God by equipping, empowering and discipling
leaders to go forth and disciple others. He is a leader among men
serving them as Jesus served His disciples walking humbly and with
integrity lifting up the name of Jesus. His call to ministry came

a multicultural inreach and outreach ministry that heals, delivers,
equips and sends disciples to reach the world for Jesus Christ
since 1992 through his current ministry. As pastor of Solid Rock
Ministry, International, the inreach ministry, his teaching,
preaching and leadership have drawn many within Wake County to

the local community and mission fields of the world, seeking to
bring others into the fold. His is a family of servant leaders and
