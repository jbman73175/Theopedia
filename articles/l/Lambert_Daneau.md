**Lambert Daneau** (1530-95) is, for historians of
[science and theology](Science_and_theology "Science and theology"),
one of the most important first generation Calvinist theologians.
He was a professor of theology at Geneva and briefly held the chair
of theology at the then newly founded University of Leiden. He had
been educated by [Calvin](Calvin "Calvin") himself.

He is best remembered for creating a systematization of Calvinist
ethics. These moral writings claimed that the foundations of Roman
and Greek moral theories were useless because of the Fall of Adam.
For Daneau, Moral philosophy instead needed to be grounded in what
God had revealed to Moses on Mt. Sinai.

Similarly, Daneau also argued that natural philosophy (i.e., early
modern science) must be founded upon an understanding of Scripture.
Thus, Danaeu held that the scientific ambitions of pagans such as
Aristotle and their adherents were completely misguided because of
a lack of knowledge about the Fall.

In 1578 Thomas Twyne translated Daneu’s *Physica Christiana*
(Christian Physics) into English as *Wonderfull Woorkmanship*. This
work is a form of Mosaic philosophy, also known as Christian or
Pious philosophy. Mosaic philosophy based natural philosophy on
Christian theology. ^[[1]](#note-0)^
