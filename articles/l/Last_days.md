## Scriptural references to the last days

-   Isaiah 2:2-3 The Old Testament prophet Isaiah prophesied that
    in the Last Days the Kingdom of God would be established in
    Jerusalem, as chief among the nations.

-   Hosea 3:4-5 The Old Testament prophet Hosea indicated that in
    the Last Days Israel would return to their land and seek the Lord
    their God.

-   Acts 2:17-20 The Apostle Peter said that in the Last Days, God
    would pour out His spirit on all people and show signs in the
    heaven and on the earth before the coming great and dreadful Day of
    the Lord.

-   2 Timothy 2:1-5 The Apostle Paul wrote that there would be
    terrible times in the Last Days. People would have a form of
    godliness but denying its power. The Apostle warns Timothy to avoid
    these people, implying that the Last Days would come about in
    Timothy's lifetime.

-   Hebrews 1:2 The author of Hebrews wrote that the world was
    already in the Last Days.

## Interpretations

[Premillennialist](Premillennialist "Premillennialist")
[George Eldon Ladd](George_Eldon_Ladd "George Eldon Ladd")
describes how [Scripture](Scripture "Scripture") makes reference to
future events with the terms "The days are coming," "In that day"
and "In the last days."^[[1]](#note-0)^

[Dispensationalist](Dispensationalist "Dispensationalist") Robert
Lightner sees the seven days of [creation](Creation "Creation") in
[Genesis](Genesis "Genesis") 2:1-4 as a pattern for mankind on
earth. The daily pattern becomes most pronounced when Scripture
describes prophetic events which will take place in the Last Days.

## Scriptural references to a biblical day

-   2 Peter 3:8 The Apostle Peter also said that with God a day is
    like a thousand years.

-   Psalm 90:4 In the Old Testament Psalms we are told the same
    thing. To God a thousand years are like a day.

-   Hebrews 4:4-9 In Hebrews we are told that the seventh day,
    God's Sabbath-rest, has yet to be fulfilled.



## Premillennial timeline

From the time from Adam to Abraham was approximately 2,000 years
and the time from Abraham to Christ was about 2,000 years. Also
from the time of Christ to the present has been almost 2,000 years.
[Powerpoint presentation - Timeline to the Last Days](http://www.lastdaysmystery.info/)

Since by some calculations the world is approaching 6,000 years
old, some interpret Scripture to imply that the end of the 6 day
cycle is approaching and God's Sabbath-rest (the 7th Day seen as
the 1000 yr. Millennial Kingdom) is at hand.

This view interprets Revelation 20:4 as confirming that the
*seventh day* will be for a thousand years.
