The **Latter Rain Movement** as currently constituted grew out of
events at Sharon Orphanage and Schools at North Battleford,
Saskatchewan between 1947 and 1948.

Religious observers marked the start of a new movement within the
[Pentecostal](Pentecostalism "Pentecostalism") family of churches
around the world because of new, some would say radical, ideas
about certain Scriptures expressed at this point by those who were
to become the movement's leaders. Believers in this theology think
that this "new wave" of the Spirit was the "latter rain" referred
to in such [Bible](Bible "Bible") passages as Jeremiah 3:3 and 5:2,
Joel 2:23, Hosea 6:3, Zechariah 10:1, and James 5:7. To some of its
followers, these events marked the most important developments in
Pentecostal Christianity since the
[Azusa Street Revival](index.php?title=Azusa_Street_Revival&action=edit&redlink=1 "Azusa Street Revival (page does not exist)").

## Beliefs

-   **The latter rain.** Central to the Latter Rain movement was an
    expectation of the imminent return of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). Based
    on an allegorical interpretation of scriptures such as Joel 2:23,
    the movement held that the outpouring of the
    [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") on
    [Pentecost](Pentecost "Pentecost") had been the "former rain" that
    established the Church, and that the current "move" of the Spirit
    was the "latter rain" that would bring the Church's work to
    completion, and culminate in the
    [Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming") of Jesus Christ.

-   **The [baptism of the holy spirit](index.php?title=Baptism_of_the_holy_spirit&action=edit&redlink=1 "Baptism of the holy spirit (page does not exist)").**
    Unlike mainstream Pentecostalism, which holds that the baptism of
    the Holy Spirit usually comes after prolonged "tarrying" or waiting
    for the Spirit, the Latter Rain movement taught that the baptism of
    the Holy Spirit and the gifts of the Holy Spirit can be imparted on
    one believer by another through the "laying on of hands."

-   **The fivefold ministry.** The Latter Rain taught that of the
    five ministerial roles mentioned in Ephesians 4:11
    ([apostle](Apostle "Apostle"), [prophet](Prophet "Prophet"),
    [evangelist](index.php?title=Evangelist&action=edit&redlink=1 "Evangelist (page does not exist)"),
    [pastor](Pastor "Pastor"),
    [teacher](index.php?title=Teacher&action=edit&redlink=1 "Teacher (page does not exist)")),
    the foundational roles of apostle and prophet had been stolen from
    the Church by [Satan](Satan "Satan"), but that God was restoring
    these ministries in the present day.

-   **Christian ecumenism.** The Latter Rain taught that God saw
    the church organized not into denominational camps, but along
    geographical lines. They expected that in the coming last days, the
    various Christian denominations would dissolve, and the true church
    would coalesce into citywide churches under the leadership of the
    newly-restored [apostles](Apostle "Apostle") and
    [prophets](Prophet "Prophet").

-   **[The Manifest(ed) Sons of God](Manifest_Sons_of_God "Manifest Sons of God").**
    Some leaders of the Latter Rain movement taught that as the end of
    the age approached, a select group of "overcomers" would arise
    within the Church. These *Manifest Sons of God* would receive the
    "spiritual bodies" mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15. They would become
    immortal, and receive a number of divine gifts, including the
    ability to change their physical appearance, to speak any language,
    to teleport from place to place, and to perform divine healings and
    other miracles. They would complete the Great Commission, spreading
    the gospel throughout the world, and at last usher in the
    [millennial reign](Millennial_Kingdom "Millennial Kingdom") of
    Christ.

## Influences

The Charismatic and Pentecostal movements in the US, and throughout
the world, have been influenced by this movement. However, this
belief is not held by a majority within either movement. In fact,
some of the most ardent critics of the *Manifest Sons of God* and
*Latter Rain* movements come from within the Pentecostal movement
itself, especially concerning the more "supernatural" aspects to
the theology.

The Latter Rain Movement had its beginnings in the years following
World War II. When its proponents tried to mainline it into the
Pentecostal Churches and in particular the Pentecostal Assemblies
of Canada where it started (Saskatchewan), it almost split the
church. Nearly half of the assemblies within that province became
part of the Latter Rain Movement and broke from the Pentecostal
Assemblies of Canada. It was an extremely controversial issue at
the time, and many felt that this was a false movement insinuating
its way into the church which glorified men of charisma. There was
also concern that it espoused a post-millennial rather than
pre-millennial scenario of the
"[End times](End_times "End times")." In 1949 the
[Assemblies of God](Assemblies_of_God "Assemblies of God")
condemned the doctrine of the 'Latter Rain Movement' as
[heresy](Heresy "Heresy").
