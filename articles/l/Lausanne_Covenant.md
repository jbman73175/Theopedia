The **Lausanne Covenant** is a declaration on
[evangelism](Evangelism "Evangelism") agreed upon by more than
2,300 [evangelicals](Evangelical "Evangelical") during a 1974
International Congress in Lausanne Switzerland. It challenges
churches and Christian organizations to work together to make
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") known throughout the
world. It has been translated into over twenty languages.

The Covenant is introduced by an extended statement of faith,
beginning with:

> We affirm our belief in the one-eternal God, Creator and Lord of
> the world, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, who govern all things
> according to the purpose of his will. He has been calling out from
> the world a people for himself, and sending his people back into
> the world to be his servants and his witnesses, for the extension
> of his kingdom, the building up of Christ's body, and the glory of
> his name.

The statement of faith includes the following topics:

-   The purpose of God
-   The authority and power of the Bible
-   The uniqueness and universality of Christ
-   The nature of evangelism
-   Christian social responsibility
-   The Church and evangelism
-   Cooperation in evangelism
-   Churches in evangelistic partnership
-   The urgency of the evangelistic task
-   Evangelism and culture
-   Education and leadership
-   Spiritual conflict
-   Freedom and persecution
-   The power of the Holy Spirit
-   The return of Christ

It concludes with the following [covenant](Covenant "Covenant"):

> Therefore, in the light of this our faith and our resolve, we enter
> into a solemn covenant with God and with each other, to pray, to
> plan and to work together for the evangelization of the whole
> world. We call upon others to join us. May God help us by his grace
> and for his glory to be faithful to this our covenant! Amen,
> Alleluia!
