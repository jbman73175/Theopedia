**The Law** is a term used to refer narrowly to the
[Ten Commandments](Ten_Commandments "Ten Commandments") (also
called the "Decalogue"; cf. Exodus 20:2-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21),
and more broadly to the first five books of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") (or
[Pentateuch](Pentateuch "Pentateuch"), also the Torah), but
especially to the material found in chapters 20-40 of the
[book of Exodus](Book_of_Exodus "Book of Exodus"), the whole
[book of Leviticus](Book_of_Leviticus "Book of Leviticus"), and
chapters 5-30 of the
[book of Deuteronomy](Book_of_Deuteronomy "Book of Deuteronomy").
The Law establishes the fundamental principles and specific
commands which distinguished [Israel](Israel "Israel") as God's
chosen people and governed their social relations and worship of
God.

As Christians, we are released from the condemnation of the Law,
which exposed our sin and rightly condemned us to hell.

## Natural law

Another aspect of *law* refers to universal moral principles that
are not specifically tied to the special revelation of Scripture.
The Old Testament appeals to natural law by defining right and
wrong through observations drawn from nature (Psalm 19:1-6;
Proverbs 6:6-11) and human relationships (Proverbs 24:30-34), and
by the fact that God holds nations that lacked the special
revelation of the law accountable for their sins (Isaiah 13-23;
Jeremiah 46-51; Ezekiel 25-32). This is affirmed in Romans 2:14-16:
"For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the
law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not
have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on
their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their
conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them on that day when,
according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ
Jesus."

## Purpose

### The law speaks "so that every mouth may be stopped"

"Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are
under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole
world may be held accountable to God. For by works of the law no
human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law
comes knowledge of sin." - Romans 3:19-20
"For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no
transgression." - Romans 4:15
"Now the law came in to increase the trespass..." - Romans 5:20
