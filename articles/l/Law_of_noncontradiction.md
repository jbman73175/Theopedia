In order for something to be contradictory, it must violate the
**law of noncontradiction**. This law states that A cannot be both
A (what it is) and non-A (what it is not) at the same time and in
the same relationship. In other words, you have contradicted
yourself if you affirm and deny the same statement. For example, if
I say that the moon is made entirely of cheese but then also say
that the moon is not made entirely of cheese, I have contradicted
myself.

Other statements may at first seem contradictory but are really
not. Theologian [R.C. Sproul](R.C._Sproul "R.C. Sproul") cites as
an example Dickens' famous line, “It was the best of times, it was
the worst of times.” Obviously this is a contradiction if Dickens
means that it was the best of times in the same way that it was the
worst of times. But he avoids contradiction with this statement
because he means that in one sense it was the best of times, but in
another sense it was the worst of times.
