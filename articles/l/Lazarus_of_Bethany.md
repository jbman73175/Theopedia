**Lazarus**, mentioned in [John 11](John_11 "John 11") and
[12](John_12 "John 12"), was
[resurrected](Resurrection "Resurrection") by
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") after dying of a sickness. The Jewish
authorities resolved to kill Lazarus when they saw that people were
believing in Jesus because of what he had done to him.

Lazarus had at least two sisters, [Mary](Mary "Mary") and
[Martha](index.php?title=Martha&action=edit&redlink=1 "Martha (page does not exist)").
