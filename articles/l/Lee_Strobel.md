**Lee Strobel**, a former legal editor for the Chicago Tribune, is
a Christian [apologist](Apologetics "Apologetics") and former
teaching pastor of Willow Creek Community Church. He is best known
for writing the semi-autobiographical bestsellers
*The Case for Christ*, *The Case for Faith*, and
*The Case for a Creator*.

Strobel earned a journalism degree from the University of Missouri
and a Master of Studies in Law degree from Yale Law School. He was
converted to Christianity in 1981, influenced by his wife's
conversion two years earlier. Strobel's subsequent investigation
into the historical, scientific, and philosophical evidence for
Christianity became the basis for the subject matter of many of his
books.
