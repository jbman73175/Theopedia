**Lent** is the forty day period of preparation observed by many of
the [catholic faiths](Catholicism "Catholicism") beginning with
[Ash Wednesday](index.php?title=Ash_Wednesday&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ash Wednesday (page does not exist)")
and lasting until [Easter](Easter "Easter"). During this time,
people are encouraged to take on special devotions, or to refrain
from certain activities, usually self-chosen.
