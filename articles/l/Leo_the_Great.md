**Leo the Great**, a Roman aristocrat, was Pope from 440 to 461. He
is the first great Pope we know much about, and even sometimes
assigned the title "first Pope". He stopped the invasion of Italy
by Atilla the Hun in 452 by his moral suasion, was a great
theologian in his own right, and was a leading figure in the
centralization of the government of the Church.

## Zeal for orthodoxy

An uncompromising foe of heresy, Leo found that in the diocese of
Aquileia, Pelagians were received into church communion without
formal repudiation of their errors; he wrote to rebuke this
culpable negligence, and required a solemn abjuration before a
synod.

Manicheans fleeing before the Vandals had come to Rome in 439 and
secretly organized there; Leo learned of this around 443, and
proceeded against them by holding a public debate with their
representatives, burning their books, and warning the Roman
Christians against them. His efforts led to the edict of
Valentinian III against them (June 19, 445).

Nor was his attitude less decided against the Priscillianists.
Bishop Turrubius of Astorga, astonished at the spread of this sect
in Spain, had addressed the other Spanish bishops on the subject,
sending a copy of his letter to Leo, who did not let slip the
opportunity to exercise influence in Spain. He wrote an extended
treatise (July 21, 447) against the sect, examining its false
teaching in detail, and calling for a Spanish general council to
investigate whether it had any adherents in the episcopate -- but
this was prevented by the political circumstances of Spain.

Leo enforced his authority in 445 against Dioscurus, Cyril's
successor in the patriarchate of Alexandria, insisting that the
ecclesiastical practise of his see should follow that of Rome;
since Mark, the disciple of Peter and founder of the Alexandrian
Church, could have had no other tradition than that of the prince
of the apostles.

The fact that the African province of Mauretania Caesariensis had
been preserved to the empire and thus to the Nicene faith in the
Vandal invasion, and in its isolation was disposed to rest on
outside support, gave Leo an opportunity to assert his authority
there, which he did decisively in regard to a number of questions
of discipline.

In a letter to the bishops of Campania, Picenum, and Tuscany (443)
he required the observance of all his precepts and those of his
predecessors; and he sharply rebuked the bishops of Sicily (447)
for their deviation from the Roman custom as to the time of
baptism, requiring them to send delegates to the Roman synod to
learn the proper practise.

The assertion of Roman power over Illyria had been a strong point
with previous popes. Pope Innocent I had constituted the
metropolitan of Thessalonica his vicar, in order to oppose the
growing power of the patriarch of Constantinople there. But now the
Illyrian bishops showed a tendency to side with Constantinople, and
the popes had difficulty in maintaining their authority. In 444 Leo
laid down in a letter to them the principle that Peter had received
the primacy and oversight of the whole Church as a requital of his
faith, and that thus all important matters were to be referred to
and decided by Rome. In 446 he had occasion twice to interfere in
the affairs of Illyria, and in the same spirit spoke of the Roman
pontiff as the apex of the hierarchy of bishops, metropolitans, and
primates. However, after his death the influence of Constantinople
was again predominant.
