**Lessing's ditch** is a term used to describe a view of Gotthold
Lessing (1729 - 1781) which argues that there is a 'ditch' between
history and eternal truths that cannot be crossed. As a result,
[revelation](Revelation_of_God "Revelation of God") in history is
not possible, for historical truth cannot be demonstrated.
Furthermore, he drew a distinction between the accidental truths of
history and the necessary truths of reason. This view "grew out of
his conviction that rationalism could be the only universally
acceptable mode of understanding the world," and thus he was
"convinced that the [bible](Bible "Bible") could not be trusted as
a source of description of any truth, let alone the truth of
[God](God "God")."^[[1]](#note-0)^
