**Lewis Sperry Chafer** (1871 - 1952), noted
[dispensationalist](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism"),
educator, and founder of Dallas Theological Seminary.

Chafer was born in Rock Creek, Ohio, the son of Thomas Franklin
Chafer, a Congregational pastor. He graduated from Oberlin College
(Ohio) in 1892. In the fall of 1889, following in his father's
footsteps, Chafer began a two-year ministry as an assistant pastor
in the First Congregational Church of Buffalo. The initial year was
an apprenticeship with a view to his formal ordination as a
minister in the (Presbyterian) Congregational community, which took
place in April 1900.

Chafer engaged in traveling [evangelistic](Evangelism "Evangelism")
endeavors from 1901-1914 during which time he maintained a farm
near Northfield, Mass. and participated in the annual Northfield
Bible conferences. Through these conferences, Chafer met an array
of prominent evangelicals from both sides of the Atlantic, among
them [G. Campbell Morgan](G._Campbell_Morgan "G. Campbell Morgan"),
[F. B. Meyer](F._B._Meyer "F. B. Meyer"), A. C. Gaebelein, James M.
Gray, and
[W. H. Griffith Thomas](W._H._Griffith_Thomas "W. H. Griffith Thomas").
His most important contact was with
[C. I. Scofield](C._I._Scofield "C. I. Scofield"), then pastor of
the Trinitarian Congregational Church, Moody's church, in
Northfield.

Through his close association with Scofield, Chafer became
confirmed in
[dispensational](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") theology,
and in 1913 he assisted Scofield in founding the Philadelphia
School of the Bible, where he served as a Bible lecturer from
1914-1922. In 1924, having moved to Dallas to pastor the First
Congregational Church. Here, with his friend Griffith Thomas, he
co-founded the Evangelical Theological College (now Dallas
Theological Seminary). Chafer served as its president and professor
of systematic theology until his death.

Chafer received a D.D. from Wheaton (1926), Litt.D., Dallas (1924),
and Th.D. from the Aix-en-Provence, France, Protestant Seminary
(1946). He wrote prolifically and is most noted for his popular
book entitled *Grace* (1922) and his magnum opus eight volume
*Systematic Theology* (1948).
