The term **Liberal Myth of Christian Origins** is used by
[N.T. Wright](N.T._Wright "N.T. Wright") to identify a non-biblical
model for the origins of Christianity that is widely held among
liberal congregations and seminaries. As it denies the
[divinity of Christ](Divinity_of_Christ "Divinity of Christ"), the
Myth can be considered an extreme form of
[Arianism](Arianism "Arianism").

## Five elements to the myth

[Wright](http://www.spu.edu/depts/uc/response/summer2k5/features/davincicode.asp)
identifies the following elements of the Myth:

Myth 1 
  ~ There were dozens if not hundreds of documents about Jesus
    other than those in the Bible. Some of these have now come to
    light, for example in the books discovered at Nag Hammadi in Egypt
    in mid 20th Century. It is these books that give us the real truth
    about Jesus.

Myth 2 
  ~ The four Gospels in the New Testament were later products aimed
    at making Jesus divine. The church selected them at the time of
    Constantine (in the 4th Century) in order to claim power and
    prestige. The church ruthlessly suppressed the multiple alternative
    voices.

Myth 3 
  ~ Jesus himself wasn’t at all as the Bible describes him. He
    didn’t think he was God’s son, or that he would die for the sins of
    the world; he didn’t come to found a new religion. He was a human
    being pure and simple, who gave some wonderful moral and spiritual
    teaching, that’s all. He may well have been married, perhaps even
    with a child on the way, when his career was cut short by death.

Myth 4 
  ~ Christianity as we know it is therefore based on a mistake.
    Mainstream Christianity is sexist, especially anti-women and
    anti-sex itself. It has aimed at, and in some places achieved,
    considerable social power and prestige, enabling it to be
    politically quietist and conformist.

Myth 5 
  ~ To revive the truth for which Jesus lived, and perhaps for
    which he died, we must embrace a different form of spirituality
    based on metaphor rather than literal truth, of feeling rather than
    structure. Individuals should discover whatever faith they can
    believe in, as long as it does not offend liberal sensitivities.
