**Liberation theology** is a school of thought that explores the
relationship between [Christian](Christian "Christian")
[theology](Theology "Theology") and political activism,
particularly in areas of social justice, poverty, and human rights.
The main methodology of liberation theology is to do theology (i.e.
speak of [God](God "God")) from the viewpoint of the economically
poor and oppressed of the human community.

Liberation theology focuses on [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") as not only
Savior but also as Liberator. Emphasis is placed on those parts of
the [Bible](Bible "Bible") where Jesus' mission is described in
terms of liberation, and as a bringer of justice. This is
interpreted as a call to arms to carry out this mission of justice
-- literally by some.
