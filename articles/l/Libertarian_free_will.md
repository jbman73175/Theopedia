**Libertarian free will** means that our choices are free from the
determination or constraints of human nature and free from any
predetermination by God. All "free will theists" hold that
*libertarian freedom* is essential for moral responsibility, for if
our choice is determined or caused by anything, including our own
desires, they reason, it cannot properly be called a free choice.
Libertarian freedom is, therefore, the freedom to act contrary to
one's nature, predisposition and greatest desires. Responsibility,
in this view, always means that one could have done otherwise.

## Compatibilist vs. libertarian views of free will

The Compatibilist believes that free will is "compatible" with
determinism (as in the sovereignty of God). The incompatibilist
says that the free will is "incompatible" with determinism. The
Libertarian is an incompatibilist who consequently rejects any
determinism associated with the sovereignty of God. Hence,
Libertarian Free Will is necessarily associated with both
[Open Theism](Open_Theism "Open Theism"), which maintains that God
does not foreknow or predetermine the free choices of man, and
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"), which admits that God in
his [omniscience](Omniscience_of_God "Omniscience of God") foresees
man's free choices and reacts accordingly. Libertarian freedom is
the general view of liberal Protestantism and a growing number of
evangelicals.

**The Compatibilist view** - This view affirms that man freely
chooses what God has determined that he will chose. In this way,
the idea that God is in charge, and the idea that man can be held
responsible for his actions are compatible ideas. Free will is
affected by human nature and man cannot choose contrary to his
nature and desires. This view acknowledges man as a free moral
agent who freely makes choices. But due to the effects of the fall,
as contained in the doctrine of
[total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity"), man's nature
is corrupted such that he cannot choose contrary to his fallen
nature -- He cannot discern spiritual things or turn to God in
faith apart from divine intervention.

**The Libertarian view** - According to libertarianism, the idea
that God causes men to act in a certain way, but that man has free
will in acting that way is logically false. Free means uncaused.
Man has free will, and his decisions are influenced, but not
caused. God limits the actions of men, but not their mind or will.
Man has the ability to turn to God in Christ and sincerely ask for
help, selfishly perhaps, apart from specific (special) divine
enablement. According to Arminianism, God, in his freedom, not only
sets a condition on salvation and wills only to save those who
would ask Him to rescue them. God, then, predestines those who He
"foreknew" to salvation. Or, according to Open Theism, God is
anxiously waiting to see what each person will do, for he cannot
know ahead of time what the choice might be.

## Objections

\1) **Causality** — If causes are understood as conditions prior to
 an effect that guarantee an effect, and all events have causes,
 then it follows that all events were preceded by conditions that
 guaranteed those events. But this is the same as saying all events
 are determined. Since the choices of humans are events, it follows
 that the choices of humans are determined.

\2) **Responsibility** — Rather than salvage human responsibility,
 some maintain that libertarian freedom destroys it. If our choices
 have no causes, in what sense are they our choices? Is it any more
 agreeable to reason to hold humans responsible for choices they
 didn't cause than to hold them responsible for choices that were
 caused and thus determined?

\3) **God's Freedom** — Some have maintained libertarian freedom on
 the basis that all things done of necessity are not worthy of
 praise or blame. But what are we to think of God's actions? We
 believe that God does good, and that God cannot do evil. Does God's
 moral inability to do evil make His good actions unpraiseworthy? If
 God must do good, is He then unpraiseworthy? Some have said that
 God must do good because God's nature determines His choices. God
 is still free, some say, because God can act in accordance with His
 choices, but God's choices are determined by His nature. If God's
 choices are determined, and God is worthy of praise, this is a
 clear case, some say, of actions that are determined and thus
 necessary while also being morally praiseworthy.
