## Eternal

God exists forever, meaning he has no beginning or end (cf. Psalm
90:2; 1 Tim. 1:17). He has always existed in the same way: fully
and completely as God. "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,
who was and is and is to come!" (Revelation 4:8)

*See main page: [Eternality of God](Eternality_of_God "Eternality of God")*
## Holiness

"To say that God is holy is to say that He is eternally separate
and distinct from all impurity. The term holiness in Hebrew,
qodesh, has the notion of separation, of uniqueness, of
one-of-kindness as it were." -Bruce Ware

*See main page: [Holiness of God](Holiness_of_God "Holiness of God")*
## Unchanging

Also called immutability, this means that God never changes in his
being (who he is) or promises (cf. Mal.3:6; James 1:17; Heb.
6:17).

*See main page: [Immutability of God](Immutability_of_God "Immutability of God")*
## Impassable

God is without passions. He is not overwhelmed by any emotion, he
is not incapacitated or weakened or stifled by any event or any
amount of grief or love. Rather, God is totally self-controlled.
While God does grieve, and does passionately love, he does so
completely on purpose.

*See main page: [Impassibility of God](Impassibility_of_God "Impassibility of God")*
## Infinite

God is not subject to any of the limitations of humanity or his
creation.

*See main page: [Infinitude of God](Infinitude_of_God "Infinitude of God")*
## All-powerful

God has all power. He can exercise dominion over the entire
universe, carry out the purposes of his wisdom, govern the hearts
of men, and even
[create things out of nothing](Creation_ex_nihilo "Creation ex nihilo").

*See main page: [Omnipotence of God](Omnipotence_of_God "Omnipotence of God")*
## Everywhere-present

God is everywhere - Jer. 23:24; Psa. 139:7-10; 1 Kings 8:27. "This
is not to say that God’s form is spread out so that parts of Him
exist in every location. God is spirit; He has no physical form. He
is present everywhere in that everything is immediately in His
presence. At the same time He is present everywhere in the
universe. No one can hide from Him and nothing escapes His notice."

*See main page: [Omnipresence of God](Omnipresence_of_God "Omnipresence of God")*
## All-wise

God has all wisdom. He works everything out for the good of his
people, and for the display and enjoyment of his glory. This
involves countless factors and people and events and decisions and
all sorts of things that would drown any stategist. But not God.
Even when things look the worst, God is carrying out his perfect
wisdom. He never fails, never lacks any foresight, and never
estimates. He knows all, and plans all, and he loves to display the
glory and beauty of his wisdom by accomplishing the seemingly
impossible.

*See main page: [Omnisapience of God](Omnisapience_of_God "Omnisapience of God")*
## All-knowing

God knows all things - 1 John 3:20; Psa.147:5; Heb.4:13. This
includes the past, the present, and the future. It includes
actuality, and contigencies. That is, he knows what will happen,
and he knows would "could" happen. There was never a time when God
did not know anything. The greatest and deepest and most
fascinating thing that God knows is himself, for his is infinitely
deep in character and substance and beauty and wisdom. "For who has
known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?" (Romans
11:34)

*See main page: [Omniscience of God](Omniscience_of_God "Omniscience of God")*
## Simple

"The simplicity of God means that God is a unified being – He is
one essence. God is not composed of a variety of substances. In
this sense he is different from humans who are made up of matter
and spirit. Jesus is not an exception to this truth. While he took
a human body while here on earth he is still absolute spirit in his
essence. The simplicity of God reminds us that God needs nothing
else to exist neither did he comes about by a number of forces or
substances joining together. This reassuring fact will encourage us
to worship him as the unchanging God."
[[2]](http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/nbi/1292.html)

*See main page: [Simplicity of God](Simplicity_of_God "Simplicity of God")*
## Self-existent

God's self-existence means that he does not need us or the rest of
creation for anything. While everything other than God depends on
God for everything, God depends on no one for existence. He is
absolute reality, with whom we have to reckon.

*aseity* n. (Metaphys.) independent or underived existence. (f.
med. L *aseitas* L *a* from + *se* oneself; see-ITY) The Australian
Concise Oxford Dictionary, second edition, 1984
*See main page: [Self-existence of God](Self-existence_of_God "Self-existence of God")*
## Self-sufficient

"The Scriptures allude to the fact that God does not need anything
that we humans need to survive. He requires no water, air, food,
sleep or money. Counselors, supervisors, and advisors of any kind
are of no need to Him. He is self sufficient in all capacities this
is hard for the human brain to consider, that someone does not need
what we do to survive."
[[3]](http://www.free-dom.org/PraiseJesus/SelfSufficiency.htm)

*See main page: [Self-sufficiency of God](Self-sufficiency_of_God "Self-sufficiency of God")*
## Immaterial

God is not fundamentally composed of matter, for he is spirit, and
he created all matter (and all spirit other than himself). This
does not mean that God is absolutely nothing ("immateriality" as a
word can sometimes mean this), rather it means that God is nothing
physical. "[T]he true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit
and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.
God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and
truth." (John 4:23-24)

*See main page: [Immateriality of God](Immateriality_of_God "Immateriality of God")*
## Good

*See main page: [Goodness of God](index.php?title=Goodness_of_God&action=edit&redlink=1 "Goodness of God (page does not exist)")*
## Love

"He who does not love does not know God, for God is love." 1 John
4:8 (NKJV) God is concerned for his creatures, and especially his
people. He is tender toward them, and does not take pleasure in
their suffering or condemnation. He seeks the best for us, and he
offers up his Son in love as a substitution for sin. He loves to
love people through His.

*See main page: [Love of God](Love_of_God "Love of God")*
## Gracious

God loves to give us what we don't deserve. He loves to pardon sin
and lavish us with his goodness. He takes pleasure in giving gifts
to people to display the glory of his resourcesfulness, patience,
and mercy.

*See main page: [Grace](Grace "Grace")*
## Merciful

God shows his mercy by not giving us the punishment we deserve.
Mercy as used in the Bible frequently has a much wider sense which
may be translated "loyal love".

*See main page: [Mercy](Mercy "Mercy")*
## Just

God is deeply concerned with making wrongs right. He lets no sinner
off the hook without a fitting punishment, or a fitting
substitutionary atonement.

## Sovereign

*See main page: [Sovereignty of God](Sovereignty_of_God "Sovereignty of God")*
## Freedom

*See main page: [Freedom of God](Freedom_of_God "Freedom of God")*
