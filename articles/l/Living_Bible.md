The **Living Bible** is a paraphrase of the [Bible](Bible "Bible")
by Kenneth Taylor and first published by Tyndale House in 1971.
Extremely popular upon its release, scholars soon began criticizing
the paraphrase as representing more of Taylor's interpretation than
the actual meaning of the texts.
