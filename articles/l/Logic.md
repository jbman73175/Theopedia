**Logic** is the reasoning used to reach a conclusion from a set of
assumptions. More formally, logic is concerned with inference — the
process whereby new assertions are produced from already
established ones. As such, of particular concern in logic is the
structure of inference—the formal relations between the newly
produced assertions and the previously established ones, where
formal means relations are independent of the assertions
themselves.
