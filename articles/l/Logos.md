## Logos and Philo

"Originally employed as a technical philosophical term by the Greek
philosopher Heraclitus (sixth century b.c.), logos became a
particularly important concept for the Stoics (third century b.c.
and later). In
[Stoicism](index.php?title=Stoicism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Stoicism (page does not exist)"),
logos was the principle and pattern that gave the world or cosmos
its character and coherence. The term was taken over by
[Philo](index.php?title=Philo&action=edit&redlink=1 "Philo (page does not exist)"),
the Alexandrian philosophical theologian of Judaism, who was
roughly a contemporary of the apostle Paul. By means of the logos,
Philo sought to reconcile Greek philosophical theories about the
universe (cosmology) with the biblical accounts of God’s creating
the world by his spoken word. God’s logos became a clearly
identifiable entity, mediating between God and the world, the mode
of the divine creativity and revelation."
