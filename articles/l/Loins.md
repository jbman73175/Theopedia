The word translated in the [KJV](KJV "KJV") as "loins" refers to
the lower back part of the abdomen, above the waist. There has been
a widespread misconception that it refers to reproductive organs.

Some (such as J. Bergman Kline) consider the blood and water which
poured out of Christ's ruptured sides to be a picture of how Christ
begat us (James 1:18), since blood and water are associated with
physical birth. They relate the Old Testament usage of the word
"loins" for begetting to the rupture of Christ's side.
