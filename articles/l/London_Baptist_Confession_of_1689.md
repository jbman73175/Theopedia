**The 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith** was written by
[Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") [Baptists](Baptist "Baptist")
in England to give a formal expression of the
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") and Protestant Christian faith with
an obvious Baptist perspective. This confession, like the
[Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")
of Faith (1646) and the
[Savoy Declaration](Savoy_Declaration "Savoy Declaration") (1658),
was written by [evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical")
[Puritans](Puritan "Puritan") who were concerned that their
particular church organization reflect what they perceived to be
[Biblical](Bible "Bible") teaching.

## The General and Particular Baptists in England

The creation of the 1689 Confession is linked to Early English
Baptist history and the differences between the “General” and
“Particular” brands of Baptist belief. In the early 17th century,
English Baptists were mainly a loose organization of churches,
rather than an established denomination. With the advent of
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism") at around the same time,
many Baptist churches adopted the Arminian concepts of Christ's
atonement and man's free will. The General Baptists were so-called
because they held to an Arminian *general* atonement, in which
Christ died for all alike. On the other hand, many Baptists
rejected the teaching of Arminianism and asserted that a
Christian's salvation was ultimately the work of God and his
[sovereign choice.](Predestination "Predestination") These Baptists
were called “Particular” because they held to the Calvinistic
*particular* atonement, in which Christ's atonement was
[limited to those whom God had chosen to save.](Limited_atonement "Limited atonement")
The terms *Particular Baptist*, *Calvinistic Baptist* and
*Reformed Baptist* are essentially synonymous with one another in
this regard.

While these differences in theology were serious, both General and
Particular Baptists suffered overt and covert persecution from the
established [Church of England](Anglican "Anglican"). Virtually all
Baptists had left the established church because they were
convinced that the Bible did not support either an
[Episcopalian](Episcopalian "Episcopalian") form of church
government, nor the role of the Monarch in determining the affairs
of the church. Other Puritans at the time, the
[Presbyterians](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") and
[Congregationalists](index.php?title=Congregationalists&action=edit&redlink=1 "Congregationalists (page does not exist)"),
also suffered persecution, but their numerical strength and
influence allowed them to escape much of the persecution that
Baptists suffered at the time. The assertion by Baptist churches
that only adult converts could be Baptized put them at odds not
only with the Church of England, but also the Presbyterians and
Congregationalists – all of whom supported
[infant baptism](Infant_baptism "Infant baptism").

## The 1644 Confession and the English Civil War

As the 17th century continued, relations between the Puritans and
the Monarchy deteriorated. Many Puritan leaders were members of
Parliament and this tension eventually resulted in civil war, which
lasted from 1642 until 1649. King Charles I lost the conflict and
was executed, and England entered into a short period of
Republicanism. These events are recorded in more detail elsewhere.

With this rise in civil unrest, Particular Baptists took the
opportunity to write their own statement of faith. Seven
congregations sent representatives to write the document. The
purpose of the document was to formally differentiate the beliefs
of the Particular Baptists from the General Baptists. This was
completed in 1644, and, while not very detailed, was clearly
Calvinistic in tone. This was known as “The First Baptist
Confession”, and predates the far more well-known Westminster
Confession of Faith which was written in 1646.

With the demise of the monarchy, the Westminster Confession was
officially declared the statement of faith for both the Church of
England (Anglican) and Church of Scotland (Presbyterian). The
smaller Congregationalists created their own version of the
Westminster Confession in 1658 called the
[Savoy Declaration](Savoy_Declaration "Savoy Declaration"). The
original 1644 Baptist Confession, while similar in
[theology](Theology "Theology"), was nowhere near as expansive as
these two English Confessions, and it became clear that another
Baptist confession be written.

## Problems after Restoration

After the execution of Charles I, Scottish Presbyterians and
English Anglicans and Congregationalists, despite sharing a common
theology, were divided over the place of the Monarchy – the former
supported it while the latter were opposed to it. Oliver Cromwell,
a Congregationalist, ruled England as *Lord Protector* until his
death in 1658. The Monarchy, under Charles II, was restored in
1660. Relations between Scotland and England, as well as their
respective Puritans, continued to be abrasive as laws were passed
regulating worship. In 1662, the *Act of Uniformity* made it
illegal to use anything but the new
[Anglican Prayer Book](Book_of_Common_Prayer "Book of Common Prayer")
in all Anglican, Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Baptist
churches in England. Moreover, the Anglican church had dispensed
with the Westminster Confession and had returned to the
[Thirty-Nine Articles](index.php?title=Thirty-Nine_Articles&action=edit&redlink=1 "Thirty-Nine Articles (page does not exist)")
as their confession of faith.

## The 1677 Confession

The result was that, with the restoration of the Monarchy, English
Baptists everywhere were suffering persecution for their faith. In
1677 a much larger group of Particular Baptists met together for
the purpose of creating a more detailed confession of faith. The
process was modelled on the Westminster Confession, which was being
used by many Particular Baptist churches despite the differences in
church government and mode of baptism.

The 1677 document differed from the Westminster and Savoy
confessions in two important ways. Firstly, it had to define the
power of the Baptist association (denomination) in its relation to
individual congregations. Secondly, and most importantly from a
Baptist perspective, it made clear their adherence to Believer's
Baptism over and against Infant Baptism. In the latter case, it was
their adherence to their view of scripture that resulted in this
belief, rather than any historical link with the
[Anabaptist](Anabaptist "Anabaptist") movement that arose soon
after the [reformation](Reformation "Reformation").

Persecution and secrecy kept the 1677 document from being
officially endorsed by Particular Baptists, though it was obvious
that many Baptist church leaders were able to make its contents
known to church members.

## The Toleration Act of 1689

In 1689, *The Toleration Act* was passed, which enabled religious
freedom and plurality to co-exist alongside the established
churches in England and Scotland. This official reprieve resulted
in representatives from over 100 Particular Baptist churches to
meet together in London from 3 July - 11 July to discuss and
endorse the 1677 document. Despite the fact that the document was
written in 1677, the official preface to the document has ensured
that it would be known as the
**1689 Baptist Confession of Faith.**

## Historical effects of the 1689 Confession

The 1689 Confession, alongside the Westminster Confession and Savoy
Declaration, are considered to be the most important Reformed
Confessions made in the English-speaking world. There is no doubt
that the 1689 confession relied heavily upon the work already done
in writing the two other confessions, but this is not to understate
its importance and influence in Baptist churches specifically, and
Reformed and Calvinistic churches generally, since that point.

Particular Baptists were quick to develop churches in colonial
America, and in 1707 the Philadelphia Baptist Association was
formed. This association formally adopted the 1689 confession in
1742 after years of tacit endorsement by individual churches and
congregational members. It was then renamed
*The Philadelphia Confession of Faith*. Further Calvinistic Baptist
church associations formed in the mid-late 18th century and adopted
the confession as “The Baptist Confession”.

During the Second Great Awakening in America, Particular Baptists
and other Calvinistic expressions of Protestant Christianity came
under sustained attack from the successful ministries of
evangelists such as
[Charles Grandison Finney](Charles_Grandison_Finney "Charles Grandison Finney")
and theologians such as Nathaniel William Taylor. Many Particular
Baptists retreated into
[Hyper-Calvinism](Hyper-Calvinism "Hyper-Calvinism"), despite the
fact that the 1689 confession does not espouse or support such
extremes in Reformed theology.

The 1689 confession remains, to this day, a very important document
for all [Reformed Baptist](Reformed_Baptist "Reformed Baptist")
churches internationally, allowing them to have an historical
confession of faith that compares favourably to the Westminster
Confession. Modern relationships between Reformed Baptists and
other Reformed denominations (such as Presbyterians) have no doubt
been strengthened by the historical similarities between the two
confessions.
