Loraine Boettner
**Loraine Boettner** (1901-1990) a [Reformed](Reformed "Reformed")
Theologian, born on a farm in Linden, Missouri. After obtaining a
Bachelor of Science degree from Tarkio College in 1925, he attended
Princeton Theological Seminary where he studied
[Systematic Theology](Systematic_Theology "Systematic Theology")
under Dr. Casper W. Hodge and received his Th.B. (1928) and Th.M.
(1929). He taught Bible for eight years in Pikeville College,
Kentucky. In 1933 he received the honorary degree of Doctor of
Divinity from Tarkio College, and in 1957 the degree of Doctor of
Literature. He was a member of the
[Orthodox Presbyterian Church](Orthodox_Presbyterian_Church "Orthodox Presbyterian Church").

From 1958 until his own death in 1990, Dr. Boettner lived a quiet
life in Rock Port, Missouri. For the remaining 32 years of his
life, he generously sold his books at cost to any who wrote to ask
for them. In doing so, Boettner made good conservative theology
readily available at a time when such material was often difficult
to come by. Through his writings, he served to popularize the
Reformed faith and influenced literally tens of thousands of men
and women around the world.^[[1]](#note-0)^
