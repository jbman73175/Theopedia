*"By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother." (1 John 3:10, ESV)*
**Lordship salvation** is the position that receiving Christ
involves a turning in the heart from sin and, as a part of faith, a
submissive commitment to obey Jesus Christ as Lord. It also
maintains that progressive
[sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification") and perseverance
must necessarily follow conversion. Those who hold to the doctrine
of
[perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints")
see this not only as a requirement, but an assured certainty
according to the sustaining grace of Christ.

The doctrine of lordship salvation has implications for
[evangelism](Evangelism "Evangelism"),
[assurance](Assurance "Assurance"), and the pursuit of holiness.
The [grace of God](Grace_of_God "Grace of God") in
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") not only forgives, but
transforms, and a lack of obedience or transformation in a person's
life is warrant to doubt that they have been born again. The
grounds for assurance include not only the objective promises of
God (like John 3:16), but also the internal testimony of the Spirit
(Romans 8:16) and holiness the Spirit produces in our lives (1 John
2:3-4,19).

The
[non-lordship salvation](Non-lordship_salvation "Non-lordship salvation")
position is popularly known by critics as "easy believism", and by
adherents as "free grace". However, proponents of Lordship
salvation frown upon this usage of the term "free grace", as the
free grace spoken of in the Bible both justifies the sinner *and*
transforms the heart unto obedience.

## Receiving Jesus Christ in repentance and faith

*This is a **[section stub](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theopedia_sectionstubs "Category:Theopedia sectionstubs")**. Please edit it to add information.*
There is a close relationship between that of *receiving* Christ
and *having faith* in Christ. In fact, the two are
indistinguishable. There cannot be an individual who has truly
received Christ who lacks faith in Christ, or an individual who has
faith in Christ but has yet to receive him.

"We can do nothing but only receive Christ and what he has done
already. Salvation is not offered to us upon any condition, but
freely and for nothing. We are to do nothing for it; we are only to
take it. This taking and receiving is faith. ... Faith cannot be
called the condition of receiving, for it is the receiving itself."
(Jonathan Edwards)
[[1]](http://www.apuritansmind.com/Baptism/EdwardsJonathanMiscCovenants.htm)
The apostle Paul writes explaining the way in which believers begin
with Christ: in faith with thanksgiving. He encourages the
Colossians to continue in the same way that they *began* or
*received* Christ.

"Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him,
rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as
you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving." (Col 2:6-7)
### Saving faith "energizes a life of love and obedience"

Sam Storms writes:

"The doctrine of Lordship Salvation views saving faith neither as
passive nor fruitless. The faith that is the product of
regeneration, the faith that embraces the atoning sacrifice of
Jesus on the cross energizes a life of love and obedience and
worship. The controversy is not a dispute about whether salvation
is by faith only or by faith plus works. All agree that we are
saved by grace through faith, apart from works (Eph. 2:8-10). But
the controversy is about the nature of the faith that
saves."^[[1]](#note-Sam_Storms1)^

## Jesus evangelistically calls people to discipleship

When Jesus preached the gospel, he both called men to trust in his
promises and to follow him in radical discipleship.

*See main page: [Gospel call](Gospel_call "Gospel call")*
## Among Christians there is no elite subcategory of joint-heirs with Christ

Paul writes in Romans 8:16-17:

"The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are
children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and
fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that
we may also be glorified with him."
Richard P. Belcher writes,

"The Greek word in Romans 8:17 speaks of glorification and not
reigning. It is a word related to the one translated 'glorified' in
[Romans 8:30]. The word in verse 17 is a compound verb (a
prepositional prefix with a simple verb), while the word in verse
30 is the simple verb alone... Clearly both a simple reading of the
passage and a careful interpretation of the passage brings us to
the same conclusion. We are heirs---join-heir with God in Christ.
The reality of our relation to Christ is shown in our lives of
suffering for Him, and we shall be glorified together with
Him."^[[2]](#note-0)^
## "Inheriting" the kingdom is not a separate category from "entering" the kingdom

Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10,

"Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the
kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral,
nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,
nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God." (ESV)^[[3]](#note-1)^
That Paul is not dividing his audience into two kinds of justified
Christians---inheritors and non-inheritors---is made apparent by
the very next verse (11):

"And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were
sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
and by the Spirit of our God."
Matt Waymeyer writes:

"The New Testament speaks of believers seeing the kingdom (John
3:3), entering the kingdom (Matt 7:21), receiving the kingdom (Mark
10:15), inheriting the kingdom (1 Cor 15:50; Gal 5:21), and having
an inheritance in the kingdom (Eph 5:5). The fact that these verbs
are not perfectly synonymous with one another hardly disproves that
each is being used to describe the experience of every believer
(albeit by emphasizing slightly different nuances of the believer’s
relationship to the kingdom). In Mark 10:14-15, for example,
receiving the kingdom, entering the kingdom, and having the kingdom
belong to you are all used interchangeably in reference to the
experience of everyone who believes."^[[4]](#note-2)^
Concerning Matthew 25:31-46, he goes to write,

"In [this passage], Jesus is describing what will happen when He
returns to this earth in glory and sits on His glorious throne (v.
31). At this time, He will gather the nations before Him and
separate humanity into two groups of people (v. 32), placing the
sheep on His right and the goats on His left (v. 33). The sheep, of
course, represent believers (vv. 34-40) and the goats represent
unbelievers (vv. 41-45). Later, Jesus describes how He will tell
the goats: 'Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire
which has been prepared for the devil and his angels' (v. 41). But
first He addresses the sheep, saying to them: 'Come, you who are
blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world' (v. 34; emphasis added). All believers,
Jesus says, will inherit the kingdom.
"According to the [non-lordship] view, Jesus should have divided
humanity into three groups: (1) the righteous sheep who will
inherit the kingdom, (2) the unrighteous sheep who will enter but
not inherit the kingdom, and (3) the unrighteous goats who will
depart into eternal fire. But instead, He divided them into two
(and only two) groups of people: (1) the sheep who will inherit the
kingdom and (2) the goats who will go away into eternal punishment.
These two groups are otherwise known as the blessed ones and
accursed ones (vv. 34, 41), the righteous and the unrighteous (v.
46). Again, all true believers will inherit the kingdom of God."
## Clarifications

### A person can be saved and not know fully the implications of Christ's lordship

John Piper writes:

"[S]omething may be real even when we don’t understand it fully or
even use the right language to describe it. For example, is a
person not 'born again' just because he has never heard the term
'born again' and does not relate to Jesus in those terms but only
in terms of faith and forgiveness and atonement? No. A person is
just as born again if he believes in Jesus, even if he has never
heard of the word 'regeneration' or the term 'born again'. Many
have been born again and saved through gospel tracts which say
nothing about the term 'rebirth.' ... [N]one of us yet understands
the full implications of the lordship of Christ on our lives. I am
struggling every day to know what the Lord is requiring of me in
specific choices among good options. I am learning every day the
extent of his lordly control of the world and his mysterious ways
of fulfilling his promises as Lord of my life and my church.
Submitting to the lordship of Christ is a lifelong activity. It
must be renewed every day in many acts of trust and obedience.
Submission to Christ’s lordship is not merely a once-for-all
experience."^[[5]](#note-Letter_to_a_Friend)^
### Our submission to Christ is imperfect and progressive

Due in part to some unhelpful rhetoric by proponents of lordship
salvation, some have objected that it

"places sanctification before salvation. If people are to give
up/turn from all of their sins before they are saved, then, in
essence, they are to become sanctified before they are saved. This
is something that no Christian has achieved in this life—not even
Paul could claim such an achievement at the end of his life (Phil.
3:12)."^[[6]](#note-3)^
But Sam Storms notes that the lordship position "recognizes a
distinction between the implicit acknowledgment by the new convert
of the *principle* of Christ's rightful authority over his life and
the explicit *practice* of progressive submission to the Christ who
is Lord."^[[1]](#note-Sam_Storms1)^ John Piper writes:

"[F]rom the time of our first saving acceptance of Christ, he is
our King and Lord and Savior and Priest and Prophet and Counselor.
All that he is, he is for those who are his. And then begins a life
of faltering and growing yieldedness to Christ in all that he is.
This can come in the form of decisive crises, or in the form of
gradually growing commitment, or in the form of daily
surrenderings. The lordship of Christ, in reality, is something
that is not discovered and yielded to once, but thousands of times.
It is yieldedness to his lordship that is at stake every time we
are tempted to sin---every day... [A]ll saved people own Jesus as
Lord of their lives but live out that submission in greater or
lesser degrees of consistency."^[[5]](#note-Letter_to_a_Friend)^
### Works are not the essence of faith

Sam Storms writes:

"We must distinguish between the content of faith and the
consequences of faith. To say that faith issues in good works does
not mean faith is good works. To say that works are the expression
of faith does not means works are the essence of
faith."^[[1]](#note-Sam_Storms1)^
Calvin Beisner puts it this way:

"The relationship of entailment between A [faith] and B [works] may
be any of several kinds. A entails B if A and B are identical; If A
then B is a valid inference by the law of identity. By causation, A
entails B if A is a necessary and sufficient condition of B: If A
then B. A. Therefore B” is a valid inference by modus ponens. By
inclusion, A entails B if all A are B, even if not all B are A: All
A are B. C is A. Therefore C is B is a valid inference by modus
ponens. [With regard to faith and works, what matters] is whether
the entailment is that of identity, cause, or inclusion. The first
equates faith and works and destroys the whole Biblical teaching of
justification by faith alone apart from the works of the law
(Romans 3:28). The third subsumes works under faith and likewise
destroys sola fide. Only the second maintains the Biblical
distinction between faith and works and the Biblical doctrine that
works are the necessary consequence of faith and so upholds the
Biblical teaching of justification by faith alone apart from the
works of the law."^[[7]](#note-4)^
### Christians can be carnal

John MacArthur writes,

"Christians can be carnal. That is, they can behave in carnal ways.
But 'carnal Christian' is not a plane of spiritual existence where
one can remain indefinitely. Carnality is never spoken of by
Scripture as a perpetual state for believers."^[[8]](#note-5)^
## The First Epistle of John

[1 John](First_Epistle_of_John "First Epistle of John") was largely
written to deal with this very issue (how you can know you have
eternal life), and thus is the most directly relevant scripture for
this issue. John wrote in 5:13, "I write these things to you who
believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you
have eternal life." He was relentlessly clear in the epistle: "If
we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we
lie and do not practice the truth" (1:6). Consider the following
passages:

-   "And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep
    his commandments. 4 Whoever says 'I know him' but does not keep his
    commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, but whoever
    keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this
    we may be sure that we are in him: whoever says he abides in him
    ought to walk in the same way in which he walked." (2:3-6)
-   "Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still
    in darkness. Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in
    him there is no cause for stumbling. But whoever hates his brother
    is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know
    where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."
    (2:9-11)
-   "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone
    loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that
    is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the
    eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but is from
    the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires,
    but whoever does the will of God abides forever." (2:15-17)
-   "And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he
    appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at
    his coming. If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that
    everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him."
    (2:28-29)
-   "Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices
    lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. You know that he appeared to take
    away sins, and in him there is no sin. No one who abides in him
    keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him
    or known him. Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever
    practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. Whoever
    makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been
    sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was
    to destroy the works of the devil. No one born of God makes a
    practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot
    keep on sinning because he has been born of God. By this it is
    evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of
    the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God,
    nor is the one who does not love his brother." (3:4-10)
-   "We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we
    love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. Everyone
    who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer
    has eternal life abiding in him." (3:14-15)

## Objections

*See main page: [Non-lordship salvation](Non-lordship_salvation "Non-lordship salvation")*
### Salvation should be distinguished from discipleship

"This Lordship teaching fails to distinguish salvation from
discipleship and makes requirements for discipleship prerequisites
for salvation. Our Lord distinguished the two (Luke 14:16-33). This
teaching elevates one of the many aspects of the person of Christ
(Master over life) in making it a part of the Gospel. Why not
require faith in His kingship? Or in the fact that He is Judge of
all, or that He was the Creator? Though my view has been dubbed
"easy believism," it is not easy to believe, because what we ask
the unsaved person to believe in not easy. We ask that he trust a
person who lived two thousand years ago, whom he can only know
through the Bible, to forgive his sins. We are asking that he stake
his eternal destiny on this. Remember the example of Evangelist
Jesus. He did not require the Samaritan woman to set her sinful
life in order, or even be willing to, so that she could be saved.
He did not set out before her what would be expected by way of
changes in her life if she believed. He simply said she needed to
know who He is and to ask for the gift of eternal life (John
4:10)." - Charles Ryrie, *Basic Theology*.
"How can the Scriptures teach that salvation is a free gift of God
if the human cost to become a disciple, that is, to be born again,
is very great as Lordship Salvation advocates insist? Salvation is
either the free gift of God, or it is costly to man. The Bible
teaches that salvation is a gift from God (Romans 6:23), but that
discipleship or following Christ is costly (Luke 14:26-27)… .
Lordship advocates rationalize the upfront commitment to costly
discipleship for salvation by calling it a difficult paradox. These
men teach that a commitment to discipleship (cross bearing and
following) is as necessary as faith in order to be saved.
"Lordship proponents have arrived at their costly discipleship
gospel as a response to the growing number of people who claim to
be Christian, but do not live up to their profession of having
placed their faith in Christ. Do advocates of Lordship Salvation
believe they can remedy the situation by demanding sinners make an
up-front commitment to obedient discipleship in order to be saved?"
Lou Martuneac, *In Defense of the Gospel* (Xulon Press, 2006).
### To require accompanying works is to deny salvation by faith alone

"If good works were necessary to obtain salvation, then why would
Paul say that salvation is 'not of works, lest anyone should
boast'? And why would he speak of the salvation of the Ephesians as
an already accomplished fact, 'You have been saved'? The answers
are simple. Good works are not a condition. Faith is the only
condition and salvation occurs at the moment of faith. No
subsequent sins can change this. Salvation is a done deal at the
moment one believes in Christ for eternal life." - Bob Wilkin,
*Confident in Christ*, pg 52.
The real issue is whether works always accompany saving faith,
which alone saves. The same Paul who taught justification by faith
alone also taught of the works that necessarily result from that
faith (cf. Romans 5-8). Paul indeed teaches in Ephesians 2:8-9
salvation by faith apart from works. In this same context, however,
it is equally true that Paul speaks of his Christian readers as
those who used to walk and live and act one way, but now do so in
another:

"And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once
walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of
the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of
disobedience--among whom we all once lived in the passions of our
flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were
by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind." (2:1-3)
Paul contrasts this past behavior with the new reality of having
been made "alive together with Christ" (2:5). Paul goes on to speak
of this grace in verse 10, showing that the grace extends not only
to forgiveness of sins and a secured future, but also to the
workmanship God performs, the result of which is a new way of
living (i.e. "walking"):

"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good
works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them."
### All faith is saving faith

"But how can we be sure that we have really believed? Therein lies
a problem created by traditions, not by the Word of God. That
question is foreign to the biblical gospel. There is no such thing
as true faith as opposed to false faith. All faith is faith. If we
believe in Christ for eternal life, then we have eternal life and
we know we have it, because He guarantees it, 'He who believes in
Me has everlasting life' (John 6:47). To doubt that we really
believe is to disbelieve Jesus' promise." - Bob Wilkin,
*Confident in Christ*, pg 55.
This notion directly contradicts James 2, which distinguishes
living and dead faith:

"So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead." -
James 2:17
Paul likewise speaks of a "vain" faith, which is manifested when
one does not "hold fast to the word":

"Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you,
which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being
saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you--unless you
believed in vain." - 1 Corinthians 15:1-2
No other gospel accentuates belief like John. It is frequently
clear and succinct in saying that those who believe will not perish
but have eternal life, yet it also speaks of two different kinds of
faith.
