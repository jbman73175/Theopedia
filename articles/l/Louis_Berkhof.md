## History

Born in Emmen, Drenthe, the Netherlands, Berkhof emigrated with his
family to Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1882. He graduated from Calvin
Theological Seminary in 1900 and accepted the call to be the pastor
of the Allendale, Michigan First Christian Reformed Church. In 1902
he went to Princeton University for two years earning a B.D.
degree. He then accepted the pastorship of the Oakdale Park Church
in Grand Rapids.

In 1906 he was appointed to the faculty of Calvin Theological
Seminary. He assumed the presidency of the seminary in 1931, the
year after the Hekman Seminary Building was dedicated on the
Frankin Street campus, and served until retirement in 1944. Taking
office during the troubled social and economic times of the Great
Depression, Berkhof stressed the importance of maintaining
orthodoxy in seminaries. Annual graduations from the seminary
increased from 14 to 17 during his tenure. This modest increase
occurred despite the fact that some felt the denomination's pulpits
were over-supplied during the 1930s. Throughout he quietly sought
to guide the denomination as well as the seminary through
controversies that arose.

A talented teacher and hard-working author, among his twenty-two
books is *Systematic Theology*, which has been translated into
several languages. In 1900 Berkhof married Reka Dijkhuis (d.1928).
They had four children: Grace Meyer, William, Jean Stuk, and John.
Later he married Dena Heyns-Joldersma (d.1984), who had two
daughters, Joanne Heyns De Jong and Wilma Heyns Brouwer.
