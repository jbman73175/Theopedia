## History

Louisiana Baptist University was originally founded in 1973 as
Christian Baptist University under the direction of Baptist
Tabernacle in Shreveport, LA. Christian educators and church
leaders decided that there was a great need to form an institution
in Louisiana to train Christian leaders in the orthodox traditions
of conservative Judeo-Christian education. LBU claims to be one of
the pioneers of distance education and external degree programs and
that many of the nations leading pastors hold degrees from the
University.

Since 1973 it has expanded its academic programs to include
Christian Communications, Christian Counseling, and Christian
Education.

In 1993 the name of the University was changed to Louisiana Baptist
University to accomodate the revised charter and the expanding
programs. As part of its significant growth and development, the
University has instituted a Seminary
Division.[[1]](http://www.lbu.edu/machistory.html)

## Accreditation

Louisiana Baptist University is not accredited by any accreditation
agency recognized by the U.S. Government, this is due mainly to the
fact that LBU chooses not to seek accreditation. LBU is one of six
approved colleges and universites of the Baptist Bible Fellowship
International and those who graduate with a concentration in
missions can be approved as a missionary for the
fellowship.[[2]](http://www.bbfi.org/colleges.htm) LBU also has the
approval of the Association of Christian Colleges and Theological
Schools (ACCTS) which is a Christian agency involved in approving
Christian schools. Though LBU is not regionally or nationally
accredited it is however, well known throughout the Christian
academic and theological community. Some of the keynote speakers at
LBU commencement ceremonies have been well known Christian leaders
like Jerry Falwell of Liberty University and Dr. Paige Patterson of
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. LBU claims that in some
cases Liberty University accepts transferred credits or degrees
from LBU as well as other well known seminaries. This is not
unusual considering the fact that credits and degrees of other
institutions like Bob Jones University (unaccredited until 2005)
have been widely accepted by accredited schools of higher
learning.
