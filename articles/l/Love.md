Christianity is a religion of **love** because the Christian
[God](God "God") is love (2 Cor 13:11; 1 John 4:8). God loved the
world to the extent that he gave his only [Son](Jesus "Jesus") for
it (John 3:16). Christians are called to love God above all, and to
love their neighbors as themselves (Matthew 22:37-39). Nor does God
leave Christians to try to work up this love by themselves – he
sends the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") with gifts (1
Cor 13) and fruits (Gal 5:22) of love.

*"In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins."*
(1 John 4:10)

## Biblical love

Biblical love is multi-faceted; it:

-   embraces self-sacrifice (Jn 15:13; 1 Jn 3:16)
-   leads one to esteem others higher than oneself (Phil 2:3; Rom
    12:10)
-   encompasses heart, soul, and mind (Matt 22:37)
-   increases in proportion to how much you realize you have been
    forgiven (Lk 7:42)
-   is faithful to the commandments of Christ (Jn 14:15; Rom 13:10;
    1 Jn 2:5; 2 Jn 1:6)
-   leads you to "feed" the people of God (Jn 21:15-17; 1 Jn 3:17)
-   is a work of God (Rom 5:5; Gal 5:22; 1 Jn 3:1, 4:7)
-   is not concealed or feigned (Rom 12:9)
-   can be proven (2 Cor 8:8, 24; 1 Jn 3:18)
-   is the means by which our faith works, and by which we serve
    one another (Gal 5:6, 14)
-   leads us to speak the truth (Eph 4:15)
-   gives knowledge and discernment (Phil 1:9)
-   binds us together (Col 2:2)
-   is part of our spiritual armor (1 Th 5:8)
-   gives others joy and consolation (Phm 1:7)
-   is in direct opposition to loving the world (1 Jn 2:15)
-   brings boldness, casts out fear (1 Jn 4:17, 18)
-   rebukes and chastens (Rev 3:19)

## Christian love

### The Christian's love for God

"And he said to him, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all
your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'" Matthew
22:37
*This is a **[section stub](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theopedia_sectionstubs "Category:Theopedia sectionstubs")**. Please edit it to add information.*
### The Christian's love for other Christians

"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and
whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. Anyone who does
not love does not know God, because God is love." 1 John 4:7-8

### The Christian's love for the world

"But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in
return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the
Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil." - Luke
6:35

## The love of God

*See main page: [Love of God](Love_of_God "Love of God")*
[D. A. Carson](D._A._Carson "D. A. Carson") points out in his
*The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God* that there are five
different categories of God's love.

1.  Intra-Trinitarian love of the Father for the Son and the Son
    for the Father
2.  "God's providential love over all that he has made"
3.  "God's salvific stance toward his fallen world"
4.  "God's particular, effective, selecting love toward his elect"
5.  God's provisional or conditional love for his people -
    conditioned upon obedience

## Hebrew and Greek

**Awhab**
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#157](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=157&version=nas)]*^),
with its derivatives, is the Hebrew verb "to have affection for"
which has the same range of meanings as the English word *love*.
This is the verb in Deuteronomy 6:4 "Thou shalt love the Lord your
God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your
strength."

**Agape**
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#26](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=26&version=nas)]*^)
is the [Greek](Greek "Greek") word for unconditional love, such as
a parent has for a child. This is the love that God has for His
people (Romans 8:35 "who will separate us from the *agape* of
Christ?") and it is the greatest of the gifts of the Holy Spirit (1
Cor 12:31 - 13:13 "now faith, hope, and *agape* abide, and the
greatest of these is *agape*"). Jesus calls his people to *agape*
their enemies (Luke 6:27). When Jesus quotes Deuteronomy 6:4 in
Matthew 22:37 the gospel writers use the Greek word *agape*.

**Phileo**
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#5368](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=5368&version=nas)]*^)
is the [Greek](Greek "Greek") word for affection or fondness, as in
Peter's response to Jesus in John 21, when he said ""Yes, Lord; you
know that I *love* you." This word is used in two difference
compound forms in Romans 12:10 "Love (*philostorgos*,
^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#5387](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=5387&version=nas)]*^)
one another with brotherly affection (*philadelphia*,
^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#5360](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=5360&version=nas)]*^)".
The word also means "affection for an inanimate thing" (Matthew 6:5
"the hypocrites *phileo* to stand and pray") which is consistent
with its use in English as a root for words such as *philosophy* –
the *phileo* of wisdom.

Classical [Greek](Greek "Greek") had a separate word **Eros** for
sexual or romantic love but this word does not appear in the New
Testament.

## Fulfillment of the Law

*This is a **[section stub](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theopedia_sectionstubs "Category:Theopedia sectionstubs")**. Please edit it to add information.*
## Liberal misuse

A common [false teaching](Heresy "Heresy"), particularly among some
[liberal](Liberalism "Liberalism") Christians, is that God's only
characteristic is love (2 Cor 13:11) and not a God of
[judgement](index.php?title=Judgement&action=edit&redlink=1 "Judgement (page does not exist)")
nor a God of [wrath](Wrath_of_God "Wrath of God"). Orthodox belief
sees rather that the love of God is made richer and deeper when
seen in the context of his whole person.
