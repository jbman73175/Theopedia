The **love of God** is characterized by his love for the world and
is exemplified in his love for [Israel](Israel "Israel") and the
[church](Church "Church"). God has supremely shown his love in
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), and so "we know love
by this, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay
down our lives for the brethren" (1 John 3:16; cf. 1 John 4:9-10;
John 15:13).

[D. A. Carson](D._A._Carson "D. A. Carson") points out in his
*The Difficult Doctrine of the Love of God* that there are five
different categories of God's love.

1.  Intra-Trinitarian love of the Father for the Son and the Son
    for the Father
2.  "God's providential love over all that he has made"
3.  "God's salvific stance toward his fallen world"
4.  "God's particular, effective, selecting love toward his elect"
5.  God's provisional or conditional love for his people -
    conditioned upon obedience
