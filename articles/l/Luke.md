## Biography

Although we know few facts of his life, **Luke** has left us a
strong impression of himself by what he wrote. In his
[Gospel](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke"), he emphasizes Jesus
Christ's compassion. He vividly recorded both the power
demonstrated by Christ's life and the care with which Christ
treated people. Luke highlighted the relationships Jesus had with
women. His writing in [Acts](Acts "Acts") is full of sharp verbal
pictures of real people caught up in the greatest events of
history.

Luke was also a doctor. He had a traveling medical practice as
[Paul's](Paul "Paul") companion. Since the gospel was often
welcomed with whips and stones, the doctor was undoubtedly seldom
without patients. It is even possible that Paul's
"*thorn in the flesh*" was some kind of physical ailment that
needed Luke's regular attention. Paul deeply appreciated Luke's
skills and faithfulness.

God also made special use of Luke as the historian of the early
church. Repeatedly, the details of Luke's descriptions have been
proven accurate. The first words in his Gospel indicate his
interest in the truth.
