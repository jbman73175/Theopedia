**Luke Timothy Johnson** (born November 20, 1943) is the R. W.
Woodruff Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at
Candler School of Theology and a Senior Fellow at the Center for
the Study of Law and Religion at Emory University. Professor
Johnson's research interests encompass the Jewish and Greco-Roman
contexts of early Christianity (particularly moral discourse),
Luke-Acts, the Pastoral Letters, and the Letter of James.

He often lectures at universities and seminaries worldwide. He is a
noted critic of the [Jesus Seminar](Jesus_Seminar "Jesus Seminar"),
often taking stances against Burton Mack,
[Robert Funk](Robert_Funk "Robert Funk") and John Dominic Crossan
in discussions of the "historical Jesus." He attempts to set out
more balanced and critical observations on this hotly debated topic
by emphasizing the importance of tradition, experience and belief.
