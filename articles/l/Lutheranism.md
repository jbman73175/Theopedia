**Lutheranism** is the name used to describe the movement following
[Martin Luther's](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") call to reform the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
in the 16th century. It also refers to the authoritative
[doctrines](Doctrine "Doctrine") and practices in the Lutheran
churches and can be used as a general term for Lutheran churches
worldwide. Opponents of
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") (1483-1546) first
applied the term **Lutheran** to his followers in the early 1520s
as a nickname to demonstrate the human origin of the movement.

The Lutheran movement led to the division of the western church as
new [Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") communities emerged
around the world. Lutheran scholar Carl E. Braaten notes that
"[n]ew ecclesiastical structures, at first intended as interim
arrangements until unity could be restored, eventually became
permanently established in separation from the Roman Catholic
Church.^[[2]](#note-1)^

As of 2000 there are roughly seventy million Lutherans worldwide of
whom between nine and ten million live in the United States and
Canada. ^[[3]](#note-2)^

## History

Three different events have been identified as the birth of
Lutheranism: the posting of the ninety-five theses by Martin Luther
on October 31, 1517; Luther's "tower experience" which occurred at
some time between 1514-1518; the endorsement of the Augusburg
Confession in 1530. ^[[4]](#note-3)^ Despite the differences,
Martin Luther is seen as the originating figure and his theology,
especially as it was developed by
[Philip Melanchthon](Philip_Melanchthon "Philip Melanchthon")
(1497-1560), is the origin of typical Lutheran thought.

## Theology

The primary doctrines of Lutheran theology stem from three 'solas'
of the [Reformation](Reformation "Reformation"):
[sola Scriptura](Sola_Scriptura "Sola Scriptura"),
[sola gratia](Sola_gratia "Sola gratia"), and
[sola fide](Sola_fide "Sola fide").
