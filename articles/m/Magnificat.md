The **Magnificat** is [Mary](Mary "Mary")'s song of praise when
she, newly pregnant with [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"), visits her cousin
[Elizabeth](index.php?title=Elizabeth&action=edit&redlink=1 "Elizabeth (page does not exist)").
It is found in [Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke") 1:46–55.

It is sung as part of the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic")
[Mass](Mass "Mass"), and its name comes from the first word of its
translation in the [Vulgate](Vulgate "Vulgate"), used in that
service.
