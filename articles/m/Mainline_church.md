**Mainline churches** is a term used to describe the main
traditional [Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") denominations in
the U.S. as differentiated from and on the theological left of
[evangelicalism](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism"). These
denominations are viewed as having adopted more
[liberal theologies](Liberalism "Liberalism") and open stances to
new ideas and societal changes while maintaining traditional
practices regarding their public gathering and
[church polity](Church_polity "Church polity"). They tend to be
influenced by
[higher Biblical criticism](Higher_criticism "Higher criticism"),
increasingly open to the
[ordination of women](Egalitarianism "Egalitarianism"), and less
dogmatic regarding issues such as
[homosexuality](Homosexuality "Homosexuality") and
[abortion](Abortion "Abortion"). In general, "Mainline churches"
are less focused on doctrine. This, along with a lesser emphasis in
soliciting new members, makes Mainline churches a diminishing
percentage of overall Protestant adherents.

For example, the largest Mainline denominations in the United
States (with more than a million members
each)[[1]](http://www.ncccusa.org/news/050330yearbook.html) are:

-   [United Methodist Church](United_Methodist_Church "United Methodist Church")
    – 8,251,175
-   [Evangelical Lutheran Church in America](index.php?title=Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America&action=edit&redlink=1 "Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (page does not exist)")
    – 4,984,925
-   [Presbyterian Church (USA)](Presbyterian_Church_(USA) "Presbyterian Church (USA)")
    – 3,241,309
-   [Episcopal Church](Episcopalian "Episcopalian") – 2,320,221
-   [American Baptist Churches in the USA](index.php?title=American_Baptist_Churches_in_the_USA&action=edit&redlink=1 "American Baptist Churches in the USA (page does not exist)")
    – 1,433,075
-   [United Church of Christ](index.php?title=United_Church_of_Christ&action=edit&redlink=1 "United Church of Christ (page does not exist)")
    – 1,296,652

  
John Green, author of *Religion and the Culture Wars*, offers the
following distinctions between Mainline and
[evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical") protestants:

> Mainline Protestants have a different perspective. They have a more
> modernist theology. So, for instance, they would read the Bible,
> not as the inerrant word of God, but as a historical document,
> which has God's word in it and a lot of very important truths, but
> that needs to be interpreted in every age by individuals of that
> time and that place.

> Mainline Protestants tend to also believe that Jesus is the way to
> salvation. But many mainline Protestants would believe that perhaps
> there are other ways to salvation as well. People in other
> religious traditions, even outside of Christianity, may have access
> to God's grace and to salvation as well, on their own terms, and
> through their own means.

> Mainline Protestants are much less concerned with personal
> conversion. Although they do talk about spiritual transformation,
> they'll often discuss a spiritual journey from one's youth to old
> age, leading on into eternity. So there is a sense of
> transformation, but there isn't that emphasis on conversion -- on
> that one moment or series of moments in which one's life is
> dramatically changed.

> Finally, mainline Protestants are somewhat less concerned with
> proselytizing than evangelicals. Certainly proselytizing is
> something they believe in. They believe in sharing their beliefs
> with others, but not for the purposes of conversion necessarily.
> The idea of spreading the word in the mainline tradition is much
> broader than simply preaching the good news. It also involves
> economic development. It involves personal assistance, charity, a
> whole number of other
> activities.[[2]](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jesus/evangelicals/evmain.html)
