## **Theological Method**

Yarnell's work in theological method is a groundbreaking effort
among the free churches. He divides his methodological concerns
into two realms: the foundation of doctrine (a.k.a. prolegomena or
*Fundamentaltheologie*) and the development of doctrine.

***Fundamentaltheologie***

Drawing upon the hermeneutics of Pilgram Marpeck, Yarnell
demonstrated that the free churches possess a distinct theological
method in opposition to, yet in frequent conversation with the
Roman Catholic, liberal Protestant, and evangelical Protestant
traditions. The foundation of free church doctrine focuses upon
discipleship to the Lord. This foundation may be considered in four
dimensions: Christ-centeredness, the coinherence of Word and
Spirit, the sufficiency and progressive dimensions of Scripture,
and the local regenerate church.

**Development of Doctrine**

The free churches also possess a distinct understanding of the
development of Christian doctrine, focusing upon the cross of Jesus
Christ as the pattern of history. Free church historiography has
much in common with modern conceptions of history, as exemplified
in the work of the Cambridge historian Herbert Butterfield. Yarnell
identified six dimensions in the free church theology of history:
the Lord of eternity is the Lord of history, the Lord of all humans
equally, divine providence, the Lord of the fallible, the Lord of
both covenants, and the Lord of the churches. These dimensions,
especially the fallibility of the churches and the equality of the
churches under Christ, allow the free church historian to avoid
privileging the free churches in history.

## **Systematic Theology**

Yarnell has focused upon the systematic loci of Pneumatology and
Ecclesiology so far in his writings.

**[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit")**

Yarnell's Pneumatology is concerned first and foremost with the
person of the Holy Spirit. Believing that twentieth century
discussions of the Holy Spirit were dominated by a narrow focus
upon the work of the Holy Spirit, specifically the charismata,
Yarnell chose to emphasize the Trinitarian dimension of
Pneumatology. This focus upon the Person of the Spirit is, however,
not without recognition of the Work of the Spirit. The Spirit is
the Executor of the Trinity, bringing into form the will and word
of God, in creation and in redemption. As God, the Spirit is to be
addressed in prayer and worshiped with the Father and the Son.

**[Church](Church "Church")**

Yarnell's Ecclesiology is apologetically free church or
[Baptist](Baptist "Baptist"), so much so that he has been
characterized as a "Neo-Landmarkist," although he personally
rejects the
label.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
Yarnell's understanding of the church is that the only proper
development of Ecclesiology is contained within the New Testament
itself. As a result, the primary meaning of "ekklesia" is that of
the local congregation. The local congregation is directly ruled by
Jesus Christ, governed by the congregation, led by pastors, and
served by deacons. The local congregation is separated from the
world, begins with a covenant, and is tasked with fulfilling the
Great Commission. The Great Commission necessitates going to the
world, the making of disciples prior to baptism, and the continual
teaching of doctrine. Yarnell affirms the universal church, yet
because its gathering is eschatological, he prefers not to speak of
it as a current manifestation except in a proleptic sense.

## **Historical Theology**

**Graduate Research**

Yarnell's ThM thesis at
[Duke Divinity School](http://www.divinity.duke.edu) was concerned
with the continental development of the doctrine of the
[priesthood of all believers](Priesthood_of_all_believers "Priesthood of all believers")
during the [Reformation](Reformation "Reformation") period and
surveyed the Lutheran, Reformed, and Radical representations of the
doctrine. His DPhil dissertation at
[The University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk) was concerned with
the English development of the doctrine of Royal Priesthood during
the late Medieval and Reformation period and surveyed traditional,
evangelical, and radical representations of the doctrine.

**Continuing Contributions**

Yarnell has continued to produce articles in the area of the
Reformation, but has expanded his concerns back into the classical
Christian period but most often forward into the modern period. He
has written on the history and theology of the Early English
Baptists and on the history and theology of the Southern Baptists.
His most recent articles have focused on Christopher Blackwood
among the English Particular Baptists, on Calvinism in the Southern
Baptist Convention, and on the history of religious toleration.

## **A Churchman**

Shaping Yarnell's entire approach to theology in his writings as
well as in the classroom is his concern for the local churches.
This practical emphasis has tempered his teaching style, making him
a popular choice for students, but his writing sometimes exhibits a
rather thick British academic style. His churchmanship was shaped
by his pastorates in Texas, Louisiana, and North Carolina, and
continues with his own local church involvement and recognized
service with the state and national conventions, especially in the
shaping of formal theological resolutions.
