## Scriptures Regarding Women

### Women in family life

[Titus 2:3-5](http://www.bible.org/netbible2/index.php?book=tit&chapter=2&verse=3&submit=Lookup+Verse)
[NET](NET "NET")
**3** Older women likewise are to exhibit behavior fitting for
those who are holy, not slandering, not slaves to excessive
drinking, but teaching what is good.
**4** In this way they will train the younger women to love their
husbands, to love their children,
**5** to be self-controlled, pure, fulfilling their duties at home,
kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the message of
God may not be discredited.
### Wives

[Proverbs 31:10-31](http://www.bible.org/netbible2/index.php?book=pro&chapter=31&verse=&submit=Lookup+Verse)
[NET](NET "NET")
The Wife of Noble Character
**10** Who can find a wife of noble character? For her value is far
more than rubies.
**11** The heart of her husband has confidence in her,and he has no
lack of gain.
**12** She brings him good and not evil all the days of her life.
**13** She obtains wool and flax,and she is pleased to work with
her hands.
**14** She is like the merchant ships; she brings her food from
afar.
**15** She also gets up while it is still night,and provides food
for her household and a portion to her female servants.
**16** She considers a field and buys it; from her own income she
plants a vineyard.
**17** She begins her work vigorously,and she strengthens her arms.
**18** She knows that her merchandise is good,and her lamp does not
go out in the night.
**19** Her hands take hold of the distaff,and her hands grasp the
spindle.
**20** She extends her hand to the poor,and reaches out her hand to
the needy.
**21** She is not afraid of the snow for her household,for all of
her household are clothed with scarlet.
**22** She makes for herself coverlets; her clothing is fine linen
and purple.
**23** Her husband is well-known in the city gate when he sits with
the elders of the land.
**24** She makes linen garments and sells them,and supplies the
merchants with sashes.
**25** She is clothed with strength and honor,and she can laugh at
the time to come.
**26** She opens her mouth with wisdom,and loving instruction is on
her tongue.
**27** She watches over the ways of her household,and does not eat
the bread of idleness.
**28** Her children rise up and call her blessed,her husband also
praises her:
**29** "Many daughters have done valiantly,but you surpass them
all."
**30** Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting,but a woman who
fears the Lord will be praised.
**31** Give her credit for what she has accomplished,and let her
works praise her in the city gates.

## Women in Ministry

The role of women in Ministry has historically been a topic of
discussion and debate in Christianity. The views can range from
"Extreme Egalitarian" which states that there is no role or
function in the life of the church from which a woman is to be
excluded to "Extreme Complementarian" which limits the role of
women to complete subordination with no authority in any aspect of
church ministry.
## Quotes on Biblical Womanhood

> Christian wives tend to leave the "fat books" and theology to their
> husbands. While this may look "submissive" to some, it is actually
> disobedience. It is not enough that we know Proverbs 31, Ephesians
> 5, 1 Peter 3, and 1 Corinthians 11 & 14. We have to know more than
> how to be a good wife. After all, our first calling is to be a good
> Christian, and if we are good Christians, we will be good wives and
> mothers. We mustn't be afraid to study topics other than those
> which are related to being a wife and mother. We see in Scripture
> that women became disciples along with the men. What is a disciple?
> It is not a mindless follower. A disciple is a student—someone
> enrolled in the class.
> 
> This can be seen in passages of Scripture: when Paul prohibits
> women from teaching men, he (in the same breath) requires Christian
> women to be students of the Word. Let a woman learn... (1 Tim.
> 2:11).
