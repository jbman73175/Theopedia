**Manicheanism** (sometimes **Manichaeism** or **Manichaeanism**)
was one of the major ancient religions of Persian (ancient Iran)
origin. Though its organized form is mostly extinct today, a
revival has been attempted under the name of Neo-Manicheanism.
However, most of the writings of the founding prophet Mani have
been lost. Some scholars argue that its influence subtly continues
in Western Christian thought via
[Augustine of Hippo](Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo"), who
converted to Christianity from Manicheanism, which he passionately
denounced in his writings.

Because Manicheanism is a faith that teaches dualism, in modern
English the word "manichean" has come to mean dualistic, presenting
or viewing things in a "black and white" fashion.

## Origin

The religion was founded in the third century AD by Mani, who
reportedly was born in western Persia and lived approximately
210–276 AD. The name Mani is mainly a title and term of respect
rather than a personal name. This title was assumed by the founder
himself and so completely replaced his personal name that the
precise form of the latter is not known. Mani's holy book was
called Arzhang and was beautified with paintings. This gave him the
title "The Painter".

Mani was likely influenced by the existing
[Mandaean gnosticism](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandaeism "wikipedia:Mandaeism")
of his day. According to biographical accounts preserved by Ibn
al-Nadim and al-Biruni, Mani received a revelation as a youth from
a spirit, whom he would later call his Twin, his Syzygos, his
Double, his Protective Angel or 'Divine Self'. This spirit
allegedly taught him divine truths which developed into the
Manichean religion. His 'divine' Twin or true Self brought Mani to
Self-realization and as such he becomes a *gnosticus*, someone with
divine knowledge and a liberating insight into things. He claimed
to be the *Paraclete of the Truth*, as promised in the New
Testament: the Last Prophet and Seal of the Prophets that finalized
a succession of men guided by God and included figures such as
Zoroaster, Hermes, Plato, Buddha, and Jesus.

## Theology

The most striking principle of Manichee theology is its dualism, a
theme gleaned from the Persian religion of
[Zoroastrianism](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism "wikipedia:Zoroastrianism").
Mani postulated two natures that existed from the beginning: light
and darkness. The realm of light lived in peace, while the realm of
darkness was in constant conflict with itself. The universe is the
temporary result of an attack of the realm of darkness on the realm
of light, and was created by the Living Spirit, an emanation of the
light realm, out of the mixture of light and darkness.

The Manichees made every effort to include all known religious
traditions in their faith. As a result, they preserved many
apocryphal Christian works, such as the Acts of Thomas, that
otherwise would have been lost. Mani was eager to describe himself
as a "disciple of Jesus Christ", but the early Christian church
rejected him as a heretic. Mani declared himself, and was also
referred to, as the Paraclete: a Biblical title, meaning
"comforter" or "helper", which the catholic church understands as
referring to God the Holy Spirit. Certain Muslim writers claimed it
is a prophecy of Jesus regarding Muhammad.

A key belief in Manicheanism is that there is no omnipotent good
power. This claim addresses a theoretical part of the
[problem of evil](Theodicy "Theodicy") by denying the infinite
perfection of God and postulating the two equal and opposite powers
mentioned previously. The human person is seen as a battleground
for these powers: the good part is the soul (which is composed of
light) and the bad part is the body (composed of dark earth). The
soul defines the person and is incorruptible, but it is under the
domination of a foreign power, which addressed the practical part
of The Problem of Evil. A human is said to be able to be saved from
this power (matter) if they come to know who they are and identify
themselves with their soul.
