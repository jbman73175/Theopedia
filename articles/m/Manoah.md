**Manoah** is the Father of
[Samson](index.php?title=Samson&action=edit&redlink=1 "Samson (page does not exist)").
Little is known about him except that from the record in Judges 13,
which states that he was of the tribe of Dan and was a good Hebrew
who desired a son and heir. The appeal of his wife was answered by
a visiting angel whose promise of a son was confirmed by a miracle
during a sacrifice. He was a trustworthy parent, rearing Samson
according to instructions. But he failed as a father so to
indoctrinate his son as to make the idea of marrying a heathen
woman abhorrent.

Manoah was one of the few people to interact with the enigmatic
[Angel of the Lord](index.php?title=Angel_of_the_Lord&action=edit&redlink=1 "Angel of the Lord (page does not exist)").
Manoah famously asks the Angel of the Lord what his name is. The
Angel of the Lord declines his request and tells him that his name
is Wonderful (Judges 13:17-18). Later Manoah claims that he has
seen God in reference to the Angel of the LORD (Judges 13:22).
