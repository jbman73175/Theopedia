Marcion of Sinope
**Marcion** (84 - c.160 AD), born at Sinope in Pontus, the son of a
bishop, he traveled to Rome circa 135 and became a member of the
church there. Developing some eccentric theological views, he
eventually taught that the god of the Old Testament was not the
true God but rather that the true and higher God had been revealed
only with Jesus Christ. He therefore rejected the theology of the
Old Testament. Marcion wrote the *Antitheses* to show the
differences between the god of the Old Testament and the true God.

Marcion was excommunicated by the church at Rome circa 144 AD, but
he succeeded in establishing churches of his own to rival the
orthodox Church for the next two centuries.

Marcion is often credited as being first to establish an explicit
canon. Marcion's canon consisted of the *Gospel*, or the Gospel of
the Lord, and ten epistles of Paul (not including the pastorals).
Marcion's Gospel was apparently a truncated version of Luke with
extraneous content underpinning Marcion's theology.
[F. F. Bruce](F._F._Bruce "F. F. Bruce") suggests,

"the chief importance of Marcion in the second century lies in the
reaction which he provoked among the leaders of the Apostolic
Churches. Just as Marcion’s canon stimulated the more precise
defining of the NT canon by the Catholic Church, not to supersede
but to supplement the canon of the OT, so, more generally,
Marcion’s teaching led the Catholic Church to define its faith more
carefully, in terms calculated to exclude a Marcionite
interpretation."^[[1]](#note-0)^
Marcion receives derogatory references from contemporary apologist
[Justin Martyr](Justin_Martyr "Justin Martyr") and heresiologist
[Irenaeus of Lyons](Irenaeus "Irenaeus"). We can reconstruct
Marcion's writings through the references in
[Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian")'s *Adversus Marcionem* and
[Epiphanius](Epiphanius "Epiphanius")' *Panarion*.^[[2]](#note-1)^

“
Marcion of Pontus... developed his teaching, shamelessly
blaspheming the God whom the Law and the Prophets proclaimed,
describing him as the author of evils, desirous of wars, changing
his opinions, and [at different times] contrary to himself. But
Jesus [was] from the Father who is above the God that formed the
world, and came into Judea in the time of Pontius Pilate, who was
procurator of Tiberius Caesar; manifest in human form to those who
were in Judea, he abolished the Prophets and the Law, and all the
works of that God who made the world, whom he calls the World
Ruler. In addition to this he mutilated the Gospel According to
Luke, removing everything about the birth of the Lord, and much of
the teaching of the words of the Lord, in which the Lord is
recorded as clearly confessing the creator of this universe as his
Father. He persuaded his disciples that he was more veracious than
the apostles who handed down the gospel, giving them not a gospel
but a mere fragment of a gospel. He also similarly cut up the
Epistles of Paul, removing whatever the apostle said clearly about
the God who made the world, that he is the Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and whatever the apostle teaches by referring to the
prophetic writings that predict the coming of the
Lord.^[[3]](#note-2)^
