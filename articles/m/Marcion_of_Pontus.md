**Marcion of Pontus** was a second century theologian who argued
that the God portrayed in the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") cannot be the same
as the God proclaimed by [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). Marcion contrasted
the cruelty, jealousy, and harsh justice of the God of the Old
Testament with the God of pure mercy proclaimed by Jesus. Based on
this understanding of [Scripture](Scripture "Scripture"), Marcion
posited that the God of the Old Testament was the Creator God, but
inferior and different from the God of mercy proclaimed by Jesus. .
. To support this theology, Marcion created his own canon of
Scripture, the first in Christian history. He rejected all the Old
Testament, and accepted only [Paul](Paul "Paul") and
[Luke](Luke "Luke") as genuine, but even these he modified by
deleting certain passages.^[[1]](#note-0)^ Although Marcion died
around 160, the church he founded persisted in the West until the
end of the third century, and in the East until the middle of the
fifth century.

Referred to by [Polycarp](Polycarp "Polycarp") as “the first born
of Satan,” Marcion was one of the most famous
[heretics](Heresy "Heresy") of the early church and the leader of
the sect known as the “Marcionites.” Marcion is known for his
[Gnostic](Gnostic "Gnostic") leanings which he integrated into a
version of Christianity. . . [Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian")
said that he was the first to separate between the Old Testament
and the New Testament. This became known as the Marcion canon and
served as a motivation for the church to deal more precisely with
the issue of the canon of Scripture. Marcion was
[docetic](Docetism "Docetism") with regard to be view of Christ,
denying his full
humanity.[[1]](http://wordoftheday.reclaimingthemind.org/blogs/2008/12/17/marcion-of-pontus/)
