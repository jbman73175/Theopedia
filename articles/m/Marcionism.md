**Marcionism** was an early [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") led by
[Marcion](Marcion "Marcion"), who proposed the first canon of
Christian texts. The proposed canon consisted of the
[Gospel of Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke") and several of
[Paul's](Paul "Paul") epistles; however, Marcion edited the
writings by deleting any references that appeared to approve of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") and the creator God
of the Jews. Marcionism thus rejected the Old Testament God,
claiming that Jesus represented the true sovereign God who was
different from the God of the Hebrew people.

Marcion's proposal for a "New Testament" helped to spur others to
respond with other canons that retained the Hebrew scriptures and
did not reject Christianity's Jewish heritage.
[Athanasius](Athanasius "Athanasius"), in response to Marcionism,
recommended that the Church approve the 27 books which comprise the
Christian [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament").
