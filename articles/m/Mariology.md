The Virgin Mary as perceived by the Roman Catholic Church
**Mariology** is the theology of
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism") that
affords devotion to Mary. "Does this mean the Catholics worship
Mary? Well, yes and no. Publicly, the Roman Catholic Church does
not afford Mary the same status as [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). However,
their reverence for her goes beyond their admiration for even the
saints. The *Catholic Encyclopedia* details a view of Mary that it
admits is not Biblical. Their view of her life and her role
originate in Catholic tradition -- that is, the writings of the
popes and theologians, rather than in the Bible."

## Summary of the issues

-   *The following is extracted from a larger work at Ankerberg Theological Research Institute.*^[[1]](#note-0)^

Significant areas of Catholic doctrine and practice are related to
the person and work of Mary. Her unique relationship to God is
usually discussed in a trinity of functions: 1) Co-Redemptrix, 2)
Mediatrix, and 3) Queen of Heaven. As Co-Redemptrix, she cooperates
with Christ in the work of saving sinners. As Mediatrix of all
graces, she now dispenses God’s blessings and grace to the
spiritually needy. As Queen of Heaven, she rules providentially
with Christ the King of Heaven.^[[2]](#note-1)^ Although views in
the Church vary, Mary has usually been elevated above all the
prophets, apostles, saints, popes and even the Catholic Church. In
the words of Pope Paul VI, "...the place she occupies in the
Church: [is] ‘the highest place and the closest to us after
Jesus.’"^[[3]](#note-2)^

Consider just a few titles of the almost innumerable books
glorifying Mary: Mary the Mother of Redemption; Mary: Queen of
Apostles; Mary: Queen of Peace; The Glories of Mary; Mary: Cause of
Our Joy and Mary of Nazareth.

Mariology is as firmly entrenched in Catholicism as ever,
especially with the honored blessing given by Vatican
II.^[[4]](#note-3)^ Vatican II "admonishes all the sons of the
Church that the cult, especially the liturgical cult, of the
Blessed Virgin, be generously fostered. It charges that practices
and exercises of devotion toward her be treasured as recommended by
the teaching authority of the Church in the course of centuries,
and that those decrees issued in earlier times regarding the
veneration of images of Christ, the Blessed Virgin, and the saints,
be religiously observed."^[[5]](#note-4)^

This charge has found a welcomed reception especially among
Catholic charismatics. For example, "It is far from unusual to hear
those who claim the baptism in the Spirit profess that one result
of their new experience is a deeper devotion to Mary. The
devotional use of the Rosary has been stimulated rather than
curtailed."^[[6]](#note-5)^

But the Catholic view of Mary is not scriptural; it is entirely
traditional. Some of the unbiblical teachings from Catholic
tradition relating to Mary include the following:

-   Mary’s immaculate conception. This doctrine teaches that she
    was born without original sin and was kept sinless throughout her
    life.

-   Mary’s perpetual virginity. This dogma asserts that she had no
    children after Jesus.

-   Mary’s bodily assumption or physical ascension into heaven.
    This teaches that because of her sinlessness, Mary never
    experienced physical death. Instead she was raised bodily into the
    presence of Christ the King where she now functions as "Queen of
    Heaven," dispensing graces to all the faithful.

-   Mary’s role as co-Redemptrix and Mediatrix of all graces. This
    doctrine holds that the obedience and sufferings of Mary were
    essential to secure the full redemption bought by Christ.

-   Mary’s right to veneration and/or worship. This teaching argues
    that because of her unparalleled role in the economy of salvation,
    Mary is worthy of special adoration.
