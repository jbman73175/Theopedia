## Together For the Gospel

The other men involved in
[Together For the Gospel](Together_For_the_Gospel "Together For the Gospel")
credit Mark with being the catalyst who forged the unlikely
alliance based on real friendships. He is felt by many to have a
unique ability to strike up a warm relationship with people from
different perspectives to himself. Having befriended each of the
other men himself, it was Mark Dever who introduced them to each
other.
