Mark Driscoll
**Mark Driscoll** (b. 1970) is an author, church planter, and
conservative [evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical") pastor of
Mars Hill Church in Seattle, WA. In 2005, Mars Hill Church was
dubbed one of the top 50 most influential churches in America from
a survey that was sent out to 2,000 church leaders.^[[1]](#note-0)^
Mars Hill Church has grown from 9 to over 8,000 in ten years, now
meeting at multiple locations.

Raised Irish Catholic, he was born *again* in late 1989. He later
graduated with a B.A. in Speech Communications in 1993, and is
currently completing an M.A. in Exegetical Theology at Western
Seminary. Driscoll founded
[Mars Hill Church](http://www.MarsHillChurch.org) in Seattle the
fall of 1996, which has grown to almost 8,000 in one of America's
least churched cities.

## Additional background

Driscoll co-founded and is President of the
[Acts 29 Church Planting Network](http://www.Acts29Network.org)
that has over 100 churches in America, as well as international
churches. It is a network that helps plant Gospel-centered,
missional, church-planting churches. He also founded and leads
[The Resurgence Missional Theology Cooperative](http://www.theresurgence.com).
He has been named one of the most influential young preachers in
America by
*[Christianity Today](Christianity_Today "Christianity Today")*
with over one million downloads of his sermons each year.

His writing includes two books:
*The Radical Reformission: Reaching Out Without Selling Out* and
*Confessions of a Reformission Rev: Hard Lessons From an Emerging Missional Church*.
He has also contributed to a 4 views book on the emerging church.
Driscoll has endorsed the ESV and will be authoring a number of
books for Crossway during 2007.

Although in the past some associated Driscoll with the
[Emergent church](Emerging_church "Emerging church"), he is
critical of this "conversation" and his conservative theology is at
odds with most Emergent proponents. Although "emerging" and
"emergent" are generally considered synonymous in popular usage,
Driscoll attempts to make a distinction between the two terms.
Driscoll embraces an emphasis on missional living, decentralized
organization, and less confrontational approaches to evangelism,
while rejecting the more liberal bent and unorthodox doctrinal
elements associated with "emergent village".^[[2]](#note-1)^ He
defines the term "emergent" narrowly to refer to the "emergent
village" and insists that he is emerging but not emergent.

## Relationship to Emergent

"In the mid-1990s I was part of what is now known as the
[Emerging Church](Emerging_Church "Emerging Church") and spent some
time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the
emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network
called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance
myself from the Emergent stream of the network because friends like
[Brian McLaren](Brian_McLaren "Brian McLaren") and
[Doug Pagitt](Doug_Pagitt "Doug Pagitt") began pushing a
theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include
referring to God as a chick, questioning God's sovereignty over and
knowledge of the future, denial of the substitutionary atonement at
the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of hell which is one
hell of a mistake." ^[[3]](#note-2)^

## Jesus

-   "There is a strong drift toward the hard theological left. Some
    emergent types [want] to recast Jesus as a limp-wrist hippie in a
    dress with a lot of product in His hair, who drank decaf and made
    pithy Zen statements about life while shopping for the perfect pair
    of shoes. In Revelation, Jesus is a prize fighter with a tattoo
    down His leg, a sword in His hand and the commitment to make
    someone bleed. That is a guy I can worship. I cannot worship the
    hippie, diaper, halo Christ because I cannot worship a guy I can
    beat up."^[[4]](#note-3)^
