**Marriage** is a contractual bond ordained by God in affirmation
of man's need for woman (Genesis 2:18) in which a man and a woman
come together in a relationship which knits them together as one
flesh (Genesis 2:24). The unique differences between man and woman
are part of what it means to be made in the image of God (Genesis
1:27). Despite the fact that procreation is not the singular goal
of marriage, it is also expected to fulfill the commandment to have
children, intended by God as a blessing (Genesis 1:28).

    by Greg Koukl - Is marriage something in particular or is it
    whatever you want it to be? Does it have a natural teleology?

## View

-   "He who finds a wife finds a good thing..." (Proverbs 18:22)
-   "Let marriage be held in honor among all..." (Hebrews 13:4)

## Nature

The marriage relationship was intended to be:

-   *Permanent* – divorce is always a result of sin (Deut 24:1-4;
    Mal 2:14; Luke 16:18; 1 Cor 7:1-16, 39)
-   *Partnership* – the husband and wife speak with one voice
    (Genesis 2:20; Proverbs 1:8-9; 6:20-21; 10:1; 15:20, 19:26, 20:20,
    23:22,25)
-   *Personal* - "...the companion of her youth..." uses the Hebrew
    word for intimate friend (Proverbs 2:16-17; cf 16:28)
-   *Passionate* - "...be intoxicated always in her love."
    (Proverbs 5:18-19)
-   *Profit* - "...crown of her husband"; "...a good thing"
    (Proverbs 12:4; 18:22; 19:14)
