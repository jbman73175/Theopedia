**Martin Hengel** (Dec 14, 1926 - July 2, 2009) was a German
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") scholar and Emeritus
Professor of New Testament and Early Judaism at the University of
Tübingen. Hengel specialized in "second temple" Judaism during the
Hellenistic period and early Christianity.

[Larry Hurtado](Larry_Hurtado "Larry Hurtado") writes of Hengel:

First, Hengel has set a high standard of thoroughness of research
that continues to instruct and inspire. Second, his frank
acknowledgement of his Christian stance and theological concerns is
commendable, both in its honesty and in his demonstration (contrary
to the anxieties of some) such a commitment can actually inspire
dedicated and critical historical analysis that wins the praise of
scholars of various faith-stances. Third, over and against both
anti-critical conservatism of a creedalistic or fundamentalistic
nature, and over and against the now-fashionable disdain of the
validity of critical historical investigation in some so-called
‘post-modernist’ circles, and also over and against the tendency by
some other NT scholars to play off critical historical study and
hermeneutical concerns, Hengel’s body of work stands as a
monumental refutation and inspiration.^[[1]](#note-0)^
Hengel passed away on July 2, 2009 after a long battle with
cancer.
