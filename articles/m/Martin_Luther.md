Martin Luther
**Martin Luther** (Nov 10, 1483 - Feb 18, 1546) was a German
theologian, an Augustinian monk, and an ecclesiastical reformer
whose teachings inspired the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation") and deeply influenced the
doctrines and culture of the Lutheran and Protestant traditions.
Luther's call to the Church to return to the teachings of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") led to the formation of new traditions
within Christianity and to the Counter-Reformation, the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") reaction to these
movements.

Luther's contributions to Western civilization went beyond the life
of the Christian Church. Luther's translations of the Bible helped
to develop a standard version of the German language and added
several principles to the art of translation. Luther's hymns
inspired the development of congregational singing in Christianity.
His marriage on June 13, 1525, to Katharina von Bora began a
movement of clerical marriage within many Christian traditions.

## Luther's early life

Martin Luther was born to Hans and Margaretha Luther, Lindemann, on
November 10, 1483 in Eisleben, Germany and was baptized on the
feast day of St. Martin of Tours, after whom he was named. His
father owned a copper mine in nearby Mansfeld. Having risen from
the peasantry, his father was determined to see his son ascend to
civil service and bring further honor to the family. To that end,
Hans sent young Martin to schools in Mansfeld, Magdeburg and
Eisenach.

At the age of seventeen in 1501, he entered the University of
Erfurt. The young student received a Bachelor's degree in 1502 and
a Master's degree in 1505. According to his father's wishes, Martin
enrolled in the law school of that university.

All that changed during a thunderstorm in the summer of 1505. A
lightning bolt struck near to him as he was returning to school.
Terrified, he cried out, "Help, Saint Anne! I'll become a monk!"
[Brecht, vol. 1, p. 48]. His life spared, Luther left his law
school and entered the monastery there.

## Luther's struggle to find peace with God

Young Martin fully dedicated himself to monastic life, the effort
to do good works to please God and to serve others through prayer
for their souls. Yet peace with God escaped him. He devoted himself
to fasts, flagellations, long hours in prayer and pilgrimage, and
constant confession. The more he tried to do for God, it seemed,
the more aware he became of his sinfulness.

Johann von Staupitz[1], Luther's superior, concluded the young man
needed more work to distract him from excessive rumination. He
ordered the monk to pursue an academic career. In 1507 Luther was
ordained to the priesthood. In 1508 he began teaching theology at
the University of Wittenberg. Luther earned his Bachelor's degree
in Biblical Studies on March 9, 1508 and a Bachelor's degree in the
Sentences by Peter Lombard (the main textbook of theology in the
Middle Ages), in 1509 (Brecht, Vol. 1, p. 93). On October 19, 1512,
Martin Luther became a doctor of theology, more specifically Doctor
in Biblia (Luther's Works, *Introduction to Volume 10,* St. Louis:
CPH, vol. 10, pp. 1-2), and on October 21, 1512 he was "received
into the senate of the theological faculty" (Brecht, vol. 1, pp.
126-27).

## Luther's theory of grace

The demanding discipline of earning academic degrees and preparing
lectures drove Martin Luther to study the Scriptures in depth.
Influenced by the call of humanism ad fontes "to the sources" he
immersed himself in the study of the Bible and the early Church.
Soon terms like
[penance](index.php?title=Penance&action=edit&redlink=1 "Penance (page does not exist)")
and [righteousness](Righteousness "Righteousness") took on new
meaning for Luther, and he became convinced that the Church had
lost sight of several of the central truths of Christianity taught
in Scripture the most important of which being the doctrine of
[justification by faith alone](Justification "Justification").
Luther began to teach that [salvation](Salvation "Salvation") is
completely a gift of [God's grace](Grace "Grace") through
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") received by [faith](Faith "Faith").

## The indulgence controversy

In addition to his duties as a professor, Martin Luther served as a
preacher and confessor at the Castle Church, a foundation of
Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony. This church was named "All
Saints" because it was the repository of his collection of holy
relics. This parish served both the Augustinian monastary and the
university. It was in the performance of these duties that the
young priest was confronted with the effects of obtaining
indulgences on the lives of everyday people. An indulgence is a
certificate that absolved individuals of the temporal penalties of
the sins they had confessed. A buyer could purchase one, either for
himself or for one of his deceased relatives in purgatory. The
Dominican friar Johann Tetzel was enlisted to travel throughout
Archbishop Albert of Mainz's episcopal territories promoting and
selling indulgences for the rennovation of St. Peter's Basilica in
Rome. Tetzel was very successful at it. He urged: "as soon as the
coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs" [Brecht,
vol. 1, p. 182].

As a priest concerned about the spiritual welfare of his
parishioners, Luther saw this traffic in indulgences as an abuse
that could mislead them into relying simply on the indulgences
themselves to the neglect of the confession, true repentance, and
satisfactions. Luther preached three sermons against indulgences in
1516 and 1517.

On October 31, 1517, according to traditional accounts, Luther's
[95 Theses](95_Theses "95 Theses") were nailed to the door of the
Castle Church as an open invitation to debate them [Brecht, vol. 1,
p. 200].

The Theses condemned greed and worldliness in the Church as an
abuse and asked for a theological disputation on what indulgences
could grant. Luther did not challenge the authority of the pope to
grant indulgences in these theses.

The 95 Theses were quickly translated into German, widely copied
and printed. Within two weeks they had spread throughout Germany,
and within two months throughout Europe. This was one of the first
events in history that was profoundly affected by the printing
press, which made the distribution of documents easier and more
wide-spread.

## Response of the Papacy

After disregarding Luther as "a drunken German who wrote the
Theses" who "when sober will change his mind," Pope Leo X ordered
the Dominican professor of theology, Sylvester Mazzolini, called
from his birthplace Priero, Prierias (also Prieras), in 1518, to
inquire into the matter. Prierias recognized Luther's implicit
opposition to the authority of the pope by being at variance with a
papal bull, declared him a heretic, and wrote a scholastic
refutation of his theses. It asserted papal authority over the
Church and denounced every departure from it as a heresy. Luther
replied in kind, and a controversy developed.

Meanwhile Luther took part in an Augustinian convention at
Heidelberg, where he presented theses on the slavery of man to sin
and on divine grace. In the course of the controversy on
indulgences the question arose of the absolute power and authority
of the pope, since the doctrine of the "Treasury of the Church,"
the "Treasury of Merits," which undergirded the doctrine and
practice of indulgences, was based on the Bull Unigenitus (1343) of
Pope Clement VI. Because of his opposition to that doctrine, Luther
was branded a heretic, and the pope, who had determined to supress
his views, summoned him to Rome.

Yielding, however, to the Elector Frederick, whom the pope hoped
would become the next Holy Roman Emperor and who was unwilling to
part with his theologian, the pope did not press the matter, and
the cardinal legate Cajetan was deputed to receive Luther's
submission at Augsburg (Oct., 1518).

Luther, while professing his implicit obedience to the Church, now
boldly denied papal authority, and appealed first "from the pope
not well informed to the pope who should be better informed" and
then (Nov. 28) to a general council. Luther now declared that the
papacy formed no part of the original and immutable essence of the
Church, and he even began to think that Antichrist ruled the Curia.
He had already asserted at least the potential fallibility of a
council representing the Church, and, repudiating what he held to
be the abuse of the practice of excommunication on the part of the
pope, he was led by his concept of the way of salvation to hold
that the Church in essence is the congregation of the faithful, a
view foreshadowed in the thought and writings of John Wycliffe,
Pierre d'Ailly, and Jan Hus.

Desiring to remain on friendly terms with Luther, the pope made a
final attempt to reach a peaceful resolution of the conflict with
him. A conference with the papal chamberlain Karl von Miltitz at
Altenburg in Jan., 1519, led Luther to agree to remain silent as
long as his opponents would, to write a humble letter to the pope,
and to compose a treatise demonstrating his reverence for the
Catholic Church. The letter was written but never sent, since it
contained no retraction. In the German treatise he composed later,
Luther, while recognizing purgatory, indulgences, and the
invocation of the saints, denied all effect of indulgences on
purgatory.

When Johann Eck challenged Luther's colleague Carlstadt to a
disputation at Leipzig, Luther joined in the debate (27 June-18
July 1519). In the course of this debate he denied the divine right
of the papal office and authority, holding that the "power of the
keys" had been given to the Church (i.e., to the congregation of
the faithful). He denied that membership in the western Catholic
Church under the pope was necessary to salvation, maintaining the
validity of the eastern Greek (Orthodox) Church. After the debate,
Johann Eck claimed that he had forced Luther to admit the
similarity of his own doctrine to that of Jan Hus, who had been
burned at the stake. Eck viewed this as corroborating his own claim
that Luther was "the Saxon Hus" and an arch heretic.

### The excommunication of Luther

On June 15, 1520, the Pope warned Martin Luther with the papal bull
Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41
points of doctrine culled from his writings within 60 days. In
October 1520, at the instance of Miltitz, Luther sent his On the
Freedom of a Christian to the pope, adding the significant phrase:
"I submit to no laws of interpreting the word of God." Meanwhile it
had been rumored in August that Eck had arrived at Meissen with a
papal ban, which was actually pronounced there on September 21.
This last effort of Luther's for peace was followed on December 12
by his burning of the bull, which was to take effect on the
expiration of 120 days, and the papal decretals at Wittenberg.

Pope Pope Leo X excommunicated Luther on January 3, 1521 in the
bull Decet Romanum Pontificem.

The execution of the ban, however, was prevented by the pope's
relations with Frederick III, Elector of Saxony and by the new
emperor Charles V, who, in view of the papal attitude toward him
and the feeling of the Diet, found it inadvisable to lend his aid
to measures against Luther.

## Diet of Worms

Emperor Charles V opened the imperial
[Diet of Worms](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_of_Worms "wikipedia:Diet of Worms")
on January 22, 1521. Luther was summoned to renounce or reaffirm
his views and was given an imperial guarantee of safe conduct to
ensure his safe passage.

On April 16, Luther appeared before the Diet. Johann Eck, an
assistant of Archbishop of Trier, presented Luther with a table
filled with copies of his writings. Eck asked Luther if the books
were his and if he still believed what these works taught. Luther
requested time to think about his answer. It was granted. Luther
prayed, consulted with friends and mediators and presented himself
before the Diet the next day. When the matter came before the Diet
the next day, Counsellor Eck, asked Luther to plainly answer the
question: "Would Luther reject his books and the errors they
contain?" Luther replied: "Unless I am convicted by Scripture and
plain reason "I do not accept the authority of popes and councils,
for they have contradicted each other, my conscience is captive to
the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything, for to go
against conscience is neither right nor safe." According to
tradition, Luther is then said to have spoken these words: "Here I
stand. I can do no other. God help me. Amen." [Bainton, pp.
142-144].

Over the next few days, private conferences were held to determine
Luther's fate. Before a decision was reached, Luther left Worms.
During his return to Wittenberg, he disappeared.

The Emperor issued the Edict of Worms on May 25, 1521, declaring
Martin Luther an outlaw and a heretic and banning his literature.

## Luther's German Bible

Luther translated the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") into German to make
it more accessible to the commoners and to erode the influence of
priests. He used the recent critical Greek edition of
[Erasmus](Erasmus "Erasmus"), a text which was later called
[Textus Receptus](Textus_Receptus "Textus Receptus"). During his
translation, he would make forays into the nearby towns and markets
to hear people speak, so that he could write his translation in the
language of the people. It was published in 1522.

Luther had a low view of the books of
[Esther](Book_of_Esther "Book of Esther"),
[Hebrews](Epistle_to_the_Hebrews "Epistle to the Hebrews"),
[James](Epistle_of_James "Epistle of James"),
[Jude](Epistle_of_Jude "Epistle of Jude"), and
[Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation"). He called
the epistle of James "an epistle of straw", finding little in it
that pointed to Christ and His saving work- though he later revised
his opinion of James, seeing it as more compatible with Pauline
teaching later in his career than earlier. He also had harsh words
for the book of Revelation, saying that he could "in no way detect
that the Holy Spirit produced it." He had reason to question the
apostolicity of these books since the early church categorized
these books as antilegomena, meaning that they weren't accepted
without reservation as canonical. Luther did not, however, remove
them from his edition of the scriptures.

His first full Bible translation into German, including the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament"), was published in a
six-part edition in 1534. As mentioned earlier, Luther's
translation work helped standardize German and are considered
landmarks in German literature.

Luther chose to omit the portions of the Old Testament found in the
Greek [Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint"), but not in the Hebrew
Masoretic texts then available, on the ground that they were
recognized as authoritative Hebrew scriptures neither in Christ's
time nor in his own. These were included in his earliest
translation, but were later set aside as 'good to read', but not as
the inspired Word of God. The setting-aside (or simple exclusion)
of these texts in/from Bibles was eventually adopted by nearly all
Protestants.
