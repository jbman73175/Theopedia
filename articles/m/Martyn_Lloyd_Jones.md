D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones
**D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones** (1899-1981), a British evangelical born
and brought up within Welsh Calvinistic Methodism, he is most noted
for his pastorate and expository preaching career at Westminster
Chapel in London.

In addition to his work at Westminster, he published books and
spoke at conferences and, at one point, presided over the
Inter-Varsity Fellowship of Students (now known as UCCF).
Lloyd-Jones was strongly opposed to the liberal theology that had
become a part of many Christian denominations in Wales and
England.

In 1966, he and [John Stott](John_Stott "John Stott") became focal
points in a controversy that arose at an Evangelical Alliance
assembly -- Lloyd-Jones called for evangelical clergy to leave
compromised denominations and unite together, primarily referring
to the [Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England").
Stott, an evangelical [Anglican](Anglican "Anglican"), argued for
evangelicals to function as salt and light within their respective
denominational traditions.

Martyn Lloyd-Jones' most popular writings are collections of his
sermons edited for publication, as typified by

-   *Studies in the Sermon on the Mount*
    ([ISBN 080280036X](http://www.theopedia.com/Special:BookSources/080280036X)),
-   *Life in Christ: Studies in 1 John*
    ([ISBN 1581344392](http://www.theopedia.com/Special:BookSources/1581344392)),
    and
-   *The Life of Joy and Peace: An Exposition of Philippians*
    ([ISBN 0801058163](http://www.theopedia.com/Special:BookSources/0801058163)).

## Background

Born in Wales, Lloyd-Jones was schooled in London. He then entered
medical training at Saint Batholomew's Hospital, better known
simply as Bart's. Bart's carried the same prestige in the medical
community that Oxford did in the intellectual community. Martyn's
career was medicine. He succeeded in his exams so young that he had
to wait to take his MD, by which time he was already chief clinical
assistant to Sir Thomas Horder, one of the best and most famous
doctors of the day. By the age of 26 he also had his MRCP (Member
of the Royal College of Physicians).

Although he had considered himself a Christian, the young doctor
was soundly converted in 1926. He gave up his medical carrer in
1927 and returned to Wales to preach and pastor his first church in
Sandfields, Aberavon.

In 1935, Loyd-Jones preached to an assembly at Albert Hall. One of
the listeners was 72 year old Dr.
[Campbell Morgan](G._Campbell_Morgan "G. Campbell Morgan"), pastor
of Westminster Chapel in London. When he heard Martyn Lloyd-Jones,
he wanted to have him as his colleague and successor in 1938. But
it was not so easy, for there was also a proposal that he be
appointed Principal of the Theological College at Bala; and the
call of Wales and of training a new generation of ministers for
Wales was strong. In the end, however, the call from Westminster
Chapel prevailed and the Lloyd-Jones family finally committed to
London in April 1939.

After the war, under Lloyd-Jones preaching, the congregation at
Westminster Chapel grew quickly. In 1947 the balconies were opened
and from 1948 until 1968 when he retired, the congregation averaged
perhaps 1500 on Sunday mornings and 2000 on Sunday nights.

In his 68th year, he underwent a major medical operation. Although
he fully recovered, he decided to retire from Westminster Chapel.
Even in retirement, however, Lloyd-Jones worked as a pastor of
pastors and itinerant speaker and evangelist. "The Doctor", as he
became known, was one of the major figureheads of British
evangelicalism and his books and published sermons continue to be
appreciated by many within the United Kingdom and beyond.
