Within historic Christianity, a **martyr** is one who dies for or
is executed because of their Christian faith. Christian martyrs in
the first three centuries A.D. were crucified in the same manner as
Roman political prisoners or eaten by lions as a circus spectacle.
They are recognized as martyrs because they preferred dying for
their faith to [apostasy](Apostasy "Apostasy") (renunciation of
faith). The Christian writer [Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian")
(200 AD) asserted that "the blood of martyrs is the seed of the
Church".
Many church historians believe that there were more Christian
martyrs in the 20th century than in the first 19 centuries
combined. This claim is, however, difficult to confirm for obvious
reasons.
