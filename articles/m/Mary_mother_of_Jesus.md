According to the New Testament, Mary was the mother of
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"), who at the time of
[his conception](Virgin_birth_of_Jesus "Virgin birth of Jesus") was
the betrothed wife of Joseph (cf. Matt 1:18-20). Mary, being a
virgin, knew from the angel Gabriel, a divine messenger sent by
[God](God "God"), that she would conceive Jesus, the Son of the
living God, by a miracle of the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") (cf. Luke 1:26-38). Mary
was also a relative to Elizabeth who bore a son,
[John the Baptist](John_the_Baptist "John the Baptist") (Luke
1.36).
