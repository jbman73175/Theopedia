The **Masoretic Text** (**MT**) is the Hebrew text of the
Scriptures approved for general use in
[Judaism](Judaism "Judaism"). It is also widely used in
translations of the [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament")
of Christian Bibles. It was primarily compiled, edited and
distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the
seventh and tenth centuries AD, though the consonants differ little
from the text generally accepted in the early second century. It
has numerous differences when compared to other early sources such
as the [Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint"), of both little and
great significance.

The Hebrew word *mesorah* refers to the transmission of a
tradition. In fact, in a very broad sense it can refer to the
entire chain of Jewish tradition. But in terms of the
**masoretic text** the word *mesorah* has a very specific meaning:
it refers to concise marginal notes in manuscripts (and later
printings) of the Hebrew Scriptures which note textual details,
usually about the precise spelling of words.

The oldest manuscripts containing substantial parts of the
Masoretic Text date from approximately the ninth century, and the
Aleppo Codex (possibly the first ever complete copy of the
Masoretic Text in one manuscript) dates from the tenth century, but
there are many earlier fragments that appear to belong in the same
textual family. For example, among the
[Dead Sea Scrolls](Dead_Sea_Scrolls "Dead Sea Scrolls") and
fragments found at other places in the Judean desert, there are
some which differ from the Masoretic Text in only about 1 letter of
each 1000 letters. Of course, there are also fragments showing more
significant differences.

## Biblia Hebraica

There have been many published editions of the Masoretic text. Most
noteworthy for Christians are the *Biblia Hebraica*, which are
critical editions of the Masoretic text used in translating modern
english versions of the Old Testament such as the
[NASB](New_American_Standard_Bible "New American Standard Bible"),
[NIV](NIV "NIV"), and [ESV](ESV "ESV").
