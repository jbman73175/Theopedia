**Mass** is the name used by the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") church to
describe celebration of the [Eucharist](Eucharist "Eucharist") and
includes the ritual of chants, readings, prayers, and other
ceremonies in the celebration. The term is derived from the
late-Latin word *missa* (dismissal), a word used in the concluding
formula of Mass in Latin: "Ite, missa est" ("Go, the dismissal is
made").

The term has been used as a name for the whole of the Eucharistic
service since at least the fourth century, and is presently used by
both Roman Catholics and High [Anglican](Anglican "Anglican")
Churches. In the
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox") churches,
the Mass is called the *Holy Liturgy* or the *Offering*. Roman
Catholics believe that consecration of the eucharistic elements of
bread and wine transforms their substances into those of Jesus'
body and blood; this doctrine is called
[transubstantiation](Transubstantiation "Transubstantiation").
