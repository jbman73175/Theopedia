## Quotes

"Masturbation is built on a self-centered view of sex. This wrong
attitude says that sex is solely about you and your pleasure. Your
body. Your genitals. Your orgasm. This is the natural tendency of
sin. It isolates us from others and makes pleasure self-focused.
When our lustful desires are given free rein, sex is pushed into a
corner and made a completely self-centered, isolated experience
that reinforces a self-centered view of life."

"Sex was not meant to be a selfish pursuit. It was not intended to
focus a person's thoughts on himself and his own needs. Rather, sex
was designed as a means of fulfilling the Lord's command to esteem
another higher than oneself. The pleasure of sex is not meant to be
enjoyed in isolation, but to be enjoyed while providing that same
pleasure to another. Autoeroticism cannot fulfill God's design for
sexuality, and thus has no place in the life of one who calls
himself a Christian."
