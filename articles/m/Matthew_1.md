## The Genealogy of Jesus (1-17)

### 1

*"The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham." (ESV)*

Matthew's use of "son of David, son of Abraham" is of great
importance. "Son of David" is used often in Matthew (9:27; 12:23;
15:22; 20:30-31; 21:9, 15; 22:42, 45), more than any other book of
the New Testament. It brings attention to the promised figure in
[2 Samuel 7:11-16](2_Samuel "2 Samuel"). This figure would
"establish David's kingdom" and "establish the throne" of Israel.
This points to Jesus' royal lineage, and also evoked an
understanding of a [Messiah](Messiah "Messiah") who would come -
like David - as a mighty warrior to destroy Israel's enemies and
reestablish the throne in [Jerusalem](Jerusalem "Jerusalem").

"Son of Abraham" should be understood as giving hope to the entire
world. God's covenant with Abraham (Gen 12:1-3; 22:18) established
Israel as a chosen nation but also promised blessings to every
nation. Thus, Matthew begins his Gospel demonstrating Jesus'
fulfillment of God's covenant to the particular people of Israel
but also in fulillment of God's promise to bring a universal hope
to all nations (see Matthew, NIV Application Commentary, pp. 55-56,
by [Michael J. Wilkins](Michael_J._Wilkins "Michael J. Wilkins")).

    by Bob Deffinbaugh

## 1-17

Matthew begins his Gospel with a genealogy. This is a way of
connecting to the Jews, since they were very fond of detailed
genealogies, as Paul indicates in Titus 3:9.

Matthew also endorses the significance of Old Testament genealogy.
"The book of the generations" is a structuring element of the book
of Genesis, and a strong connection is created by this terminology.
This passage demonstrates that genealogy holds more significance
than simply being because Matthew draws attention to the fact that
he has developed the genealogy of Christ to three groups of
fourteen. This is also part of the basis for Biblical numerology,
since Matthew has to tinker with the details to obtain a desired
result; evidently the desired result (structuring the history of
Israel in multiples of seven) has some significance.

### Difficulties

Critics have raised several problems with Matthew's genealogy.
First of all, there are only 41 names, whereas three fourteens
should make 42 names. This is explained by the fact that Matthew
lists David's name in both the first fourteen and the second
fourteen.

A more serious issue is that comparison with Old Testament records
shows that there are gaps. This is explained by the fact that, in
Old Testament usage, gaps frequently occur in genealogies because
the grandson is considered to be in the [loins](Loins "Loins") of
the father as well as the child. Levi was in the loins of Abraham
according to Hebrews 7:9-10.

Matthew was a tax collector. He would have been well-trained in
counting things, and he was certainly very meticulous. He knew that
his genealogy was not the most straight-forward, but he endorses
numerology by manipulating the genealogy to obtain the perfection
that he wanted to communicate.

## The Birth of Jesus Christ (18-25)

Jesus was born to a virgin. There is a hint of the virgin birth of
the Promised Seed in
[Genesis 3:15](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Genesis_3:15&action=edit&redlink=1 "Genesis 3:15 (page does not exist)")
("the woman's seed", not "the man's seed"). The most direct
interpretation of
[Isaiah 7:14](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Isaiah_7:14&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isaiah 7:14 (page does not exist)")
, although there is some debate about the exact significance of
this passage. At any rate, the miracle of Jesus' birth is a
fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.
