### 28 - 29

> *Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls*.
>

Scholars believe that [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")' words stem from two
passages in Jeremiah. In verse 28 he says that he will give rest,
which is something promised from God in Jeremiah 31:25, "For I will
satisfy the weary soul, and every languishing soul I will
replenish." Furthermore, in verse 29 Jesus says that he will give
rest to their souls. This is believed to come from Jeremiah 6:16
where it says, "Thus says the LORD: "Stand by the roads, and look,
and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is; and walk in
it, and find rest for your souls." Thus, the promises from
[God](God "God") in the
[Book of Jeremiah](Book_of_Jeremiah "Book of Jeremiah") are later
fulfilled completely by Jesus in the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament").^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
