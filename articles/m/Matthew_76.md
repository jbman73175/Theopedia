## Text

*"Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you." ([ESV](ESV "ESV"))*

## Majority view

"Jesus is reminding us that being non-judgmental does not mean we
are undiscerning, wasteful, and silly. We are to recognize that
there are some people so hardened to receiving the message that
they will not listen; we are to quit wasting our time in trying to
convince them. He chooses the powerful imagery of a well-known
proverb to make his point. He says similar things in a softer way
elsewhere. The bottom line, however, is that there comes a time
when we realize that people will not hear the Gospel message. Their
repeated determination not to hear and their unwillingness to
respond don't mean we are to try harder, but simply to try
elsewhere! Being a nonjudgmental person does not mean we refuse to
'see the handwriting on the wall' and keep wasting our efforts on
those who refuse to hear."

"I believe he's saying that you only need to present the gospel to
a certain point and when then people become abusive and
blasphemous, it's time to cease at that point, at least, the
offering. There is a limit." -John MacArthur

## Minority view

Most share this view with MacArthur, but some modern interpreters
like [Dallas Willard](Dallas_Willard "Dallas Willard") believe this
verse is focused on the verbal abuse of the one casting the pearls,
and that he should be more helpful (pigs can't eat pearls) in order
for the other person not to respond negatively. "Don't emphasize
the swine, emphasize our casting the wrong thing, pushing our
agenda on people."

More palatable, digestible needs, as it were, ought to be attended
to first. The main arguments for this are:

-   To stop evangelizing a seemingly hardened person contradicts
    other teachings (especially Matthew 5:43-45) and actions of Jesus.
-   The verse follows a passage about being judgmental, something
    that concerns interpersonal relationships.
-   The following passage speaks of a way of relating to others
    that is more loving (asking, knocking, seeking).

"Let us be clear once and for all that Jesus is not suggesting that
certain classes of people are to be viewed as pigs of dogs. Nor is
he saying that we should not give good things and do good deeds to
people who might reject or misuse them. In fact, his teaching is
precisely the opposite. We are to be like the Father in the heavens
who is kind to the unthankful and the evil. The problem with pearls
for pigs is not that the pigs are not worthy. It is not worthiness
that is in question here at all, but helpfulness. Pigs cannot
digest pearls, cannot nourish themselves upon them. Likewise for a
dog with a Bible or a crucifix. The dog cannot eat it. The reason
these animals will finally "turn and rend you" when you one day
step up to them with another load of Bibles or pearls, is that YOU
at least are edible. Anyone who has had serious responsibilities of
caring for animals will understand immediately what Jesus is
saying. And what a picture this is of our efforts to correct and
control others by pouring our good things, often truly precious
things, upon them--things that they nevertheless simply cannot
ingest and use to nourish themselves. The point is not the waste of
the 'pearl' but that the person given the pearl is not helped."

*The Divine Conspiracy*, p. 228
### Objections to minority view

-   The text need not be unduly connected with the previous
    verses.

"It is unnecessary to repeat oftener, that Matthew gives us here
detached sentences, which ought not to be viewed as a continued
discourse. The present instruction is not at all connected with
what came immediately before, but is entirely separate from it."
-John Calvin
[[4]](http://www.ccel.org/c/calvin/comment3/comm_vol31/htm/ix.lxii.htm)
-   To cease an effort to evangelize accords with other New
    Testament teachings. Jesus elsewhere tells his disciples to shake
    the dust off their feet (Mark 6:11), and Paul speaks of not eating
    with unrepentant, professing believers (1 Corinthians 5).
-   The following verses (ask, seek, knock) are about God's
    graciousness, not peoples'.
-   The minority view overwhelmingly opposes the historic
    interpretation of Christians.

Some hold that the two interpertations do not really contradict
each other, but that the passage isn't necessarily about first
attending palatable needs.
