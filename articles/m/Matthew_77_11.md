*"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!" ([NIV](NIV "NIV"))*

## Majority view

The most popular interpertation of this passage is that God is a
gracious, giving God, and will answer prayer.

## Minority view

Some hold that verse 12 (especially the "so") shows that Jesus is
giving us a way that we can "do unto others what you would have
them do unto you." Basically, verse 12 helps us understand the
previous verses: that asking, seeking, and knocking gives us a
helpful way to form loving, interpersonal relationships free from
judgmentalism and unhelpful pearl-casting (see 7:1-6).

" 'Asking' respects that the other person is in their own
relationship with God. When we judge or when we impose our ‘pearls’
on someone else we become that person’s problem. Our brother or
sister, child or friend may try to impress us and earn our approval
instead of our condemnation. They may try to defend themselves from
us, they may become angry with us. But when we ask them to change,
or we ask how they are doing, or if there is any way we can be
helpful, we are coming along side. Our brother or sister or friend
might then see us as ‘on their side’. If they come to trust us, in
time they might even ask us for our honest opinion. They might even
ask us for some input into their situation." -John Luth

### Objections

The "so" in verse 12 is not the logical connector of the preceding
verses, as verse 11 contains the conclusion of the passage:

"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your
children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good
things to those who ask him!"
Furthermore, one should also pay attention to the greek word "oun"
in verse 11. This can be translated "therefore" and thus gives the
correct logical connector to verses 6-11. The argument of the
passage could be summed up as such:

Those who ask, seek, and knock will receive and find and have the
door opened for them. Therefore, we should ask, seek, and knock.
God knows how to give good gifts to *those who ask*, for even an
evil man knows how to give good gifts to those who ask him.
So what do we do with verse 12? If we pay attention to the context,
it should become more obvious that verse 12 is somewhat of a
conclusion. So just as verses 7-10 set us up to understand verse
11, verses 7-11 (as a whole) help us understand the application
verse 12 gives us. [D.A. Carson](D.A._Carson "D.A. Carson")
actually finds that verse 12 most likely refers back to the entire
sermon of 5:17-7:12. "'Therefore', in light of all I have taught
about the true direction in which the OT law points, obey the
[Golden Rule](Golden_Rule "Golden Rule")..."
(*The Expositors Bible Commentary: Matthew, Mark, and Luke*, vol.
8, D.A. Carson, p. 188). All of the Law and the Prophets are summed
up in verse 12, and so the most likely and most reasonable
interpretation involves *all* of what Jesus said rather than simply
the last few things spoken of in the immediate context. Verse 11
deals with "asking", while verse 12 deals with what "you wish
others would do." Wilkins summarizes this quite nicely:

"'Ask...seek...knock and the door will be opened to you.' Jesus'
disciples may find it difficult to be at the same time both
merciful and forgiving, yet wisely discerning; to give other
disciples the benefit of the doubt, yet to be on guard for those
who would harm the community; to judge no one, yet to be wisely
observant to see the true character of people and deal with them
accordingly. But through the divine enablement that is supplied by
God as Jesus' disciples pray, they can avoid the extremes of 7:1-5
and 7:6" (*The NIV Application Commentary*,
[Michael J. Wilkins](Michael_J._Wilkins "Michael J. Wilkins"),
p.p.311-312).
Therefore the asking, seeking, and knocking bring together man's
search for God, not man's relationship with one another.
