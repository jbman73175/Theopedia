**Matthew** was one of the [Apostles](Apostle "Apostle") of Christ
and author of the [gospel](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew")
that bears his name. He appears in all the lists of the twelve
apostles (Matthew 10:3, Mark 3:18, Luke 6:15 and Acts 1:13). In
Matthew 10:3 he is described as "the tax-collector". Matthew 9:9
describes Matthew's call to be a disciple. In the parallel passages
in Mark and Luke he is referred to as Levi, and Mark adds that he
was "the son of Alphaeus".
