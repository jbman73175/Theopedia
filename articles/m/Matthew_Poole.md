**Matthew Poole** (1624-1679), English
[Nonconformist](Nonconformist "Nonconformist") theologian, was born
at York, educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and from 1649
till the passing of the Act of Uniformity (1662) held the rectory
of St Michael le Querne, London. Subsequent troubles led to his
withdrawal to Holland, and he died at Amsterdam in 1679.

The work with which his name is principally associated is the
*Synopsis criticorum biblicorum* (5 vols. fol., 1669-1676), in
which he summarizes the views of one hundred and fifty biblical
critics. He also wrote *English Annotations on the Holy Bible*, as
far as Isaiah chapter 53 - a work which was completed by several of
his Nonconformist brethren, and published in 2 folio volumes in
1683. It has been subsequently published as Matthew Pooles'
*Commentary on the Holy Bible* in 3 volumes.

[C. H. Spurgeon](Charles_Haddon_Spurgeon "Charles Haddon Spurgeon")
said of Poole's commentary: "If I must have only one commentary,
and had read Matthew Henry as I have, I do not know but what I
should choose Poole. He is a very prudent and judicious
commentator... not so pithy and witty by far as Matthew Henry, but
he is perhaps more accurate, less a commentator, and more an
expositor."
