**Means of grace** are instruments that God uses to convert and
bless people, like the reading and
[preaching](Preaching "Preaching") of the word,
[prayer](Prayer "Prayer"), singing (psalms, hymns, and spiritual
songs; Acts 16:25; Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16), enjoying the
beauty of God's creation, [baptism](Baptism "Baptism"), and the
[Lord's supper](Communion "Communion").

"The “means of grace” that the Bible talks about are His Word (“the
word of His grace,” Acts 20:32), His Spirit (“the Spirit of grace,”
Hebrews 10:29), prayer made to the “throne of grace” (Hebrews
4:16), and the grace that is given to the saints which enables them
to build up another (Ephesians 4:7; 1 Peter 4:10)." - Bob

## Quotes

-   "There is a kind of paradox here: On the one hand I say, I need
    you. God has appointed you as a means of grace to help me endure to
    the end. But on the other hand, I must say that the only way you
    can really help me is by saying something or doing something that
    will cause me to depend on God and not you."
    -[John Piper](John_Piper "John Piper")
    [[2]](http://www.desiringgod.org/library/sermons/86/091486.html)

-   "Breathing is the means that God uses to sustain life. So the
    command to breathe is the command to fall in with the purposes and
    patterns of God to give and sustain life. This is what I mean by
    the term, 'means of grace.' 'Grace' is the free keeping-work of God
    to sustain our spiritual life that leads to everlasting joy. The
    "means of grace" is our 'keeping ourselves in the love of God.'
    God's 'keeping' inspires and sustains our 'keeping.' His keeping is
    decisive and our keeping is dependent on his." -John Piper
