**Melchizedek** is an
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") character, who is
later shown to be an [antitype](Typology "Typology") of
[Christ](Jesus "Jesus"). The name Melchizedek means "king of
righteousness" and Salem means "peace".

## Old Testament

Melchizedek came out to meet [Abram](Abraham "Abraham"), after
Abram, along with with 318 men who he had trained, had defeated
five kings in the Vale of Siddim. The battle was fought to rescue
Abram's nephew, [Lot](Lot "Lot") and his household. It is
noteworthy that Melchizedek came out to meet Abram rather than
Abram seeking out Melchizedek. Melchizedek was a king and
[priest](Priest "Priest"), unlike the later Levitical priests who
were separate from royalty. Melchizedek came from Salem, which was
later called Jerusalem.

Abram paid tithes to Melchizedek because he was priest of the "Most
High [God](God "God")". Melchizedek gave bread and wine to Abram,
which many see as foreshadowing the bread and wine of
[the Lord's Supper](Communion "Communion").

## New Testament

The writer to the
[Hebrews](Epistle_to_the_Hebrews "Epistle to the Hebrews") declares
that Jesus Christ is a Priest after the order of Melchizedek,
because God has sworn it (Psalm 110:4). The writer shows that the
Levitical priesthood was only a type or shadow of the priesthood of
Christ, who won the victory over death.
