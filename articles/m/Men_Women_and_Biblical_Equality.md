The Bible teaches that God has revealed Himself in the totality of
Scripture, the authoritative Word of God (Matt 5:18; John 10:35; 2
Tim 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21). We believe that Scripture is to be
interpreted holistically and thematically. We also recognize the
necessity of making a distinction between inspiration and
interpretation: inspiration relates to the divine impulse and
control whereby the whole canonical Scripture is the Word of God;
interpretation relates to the human activity whereby we seek to
apprehend revealed truth in harmony with the totality of Scripture
and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. To be truly biblical,
Christians must continually examine their faith and practice under
the searchlight of Scripture.
\1. The Bible teaches that both man and woman were created in God’s
 image, had a direct relationship with God, and shared jointly the
 responsibilities of bearing and rearing children and having
 dominion over the created order (Gen 1:26-28).

\2. The Bible teaches that woman and man were created for full and
 equal partnership. The word “helper” (ezer) used to designate woman
 in Genesis 2:18 refers to God in most instances of Old Testament
 usage (e.g., 1 Sam 7:12; Ps 121:1-2). Consequently the word conveys
 no implication whatsoever of female subordination or inferiority.

\3. The Bible teaches that the forming of woman from man
 demonstrates the fundamental unity and equality of human beings
 (Gen 2:21-23). In Genesis 2:18, 20, the word “suitable”
 *(Ezer kenegdo)* denotes equality and adequacy.

\4. The Bible teaches that man and woman were co-participants in
 the Fall: Adam was no less culpable than Eve (Gen 3:6; Rom 5:12-21;
 1 Cor 15:21-22).

\5. The Bible teaches that the rulership of Adam over Eve resulted
 from the Fall and was therefore not a part of the original created
 order. Genesis 3:16 is a prediction of the effects of the Fall
 rather than a prescription of God’s ideal order.

Redemption
\6. The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ came to redeem women as
 well as men. Through faith in Christ we all become children of God,
 one in Christ, and heirs to the blessings of salvation without
 reference to racial, social, or gender distinctives (John 1:12-13;
 Rom 8:14-17; 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 3:26-28).

Community
\7. The Bible teaches that at Pentecost the Holy Spirit came on men
 and women alike. Without distinction, the Holy Spirit indwells
 women and men, and sovereignly distributes gifts without preference
 as to gender (Acts 2:1-21; 1 Cor 12:7, 11, 14:31).

\8. The Bible teaches that both women and men are called to develop
 their spiritual gifts and to use them as stewards of the grace of
 God (1 Peter 4:10-11). Both men and women are divinely gifted and
 empowered to minister to the whole Body of Christ, under His
 authority (Acts 1:14, 18:26, 21:9; Rom 16:1-7, 12-13, 15; Phil
 4:2-3; Col 4:15; see also Mark 15:40-41, 16:1-7; Luke 8:1-3; John
 20:17-18; compare also Old Testament examples: Judges 4:4-14, 5:7;
 2 Chron 34:22-28; Prov 31:30-31; Micah 6:4).

\9. The Bible teaches that, in the New Testament economy, women as
 well as men exercise the prophetic, priestly and royal functions
 (Acts 2:17-18, 21:9; 1 Cor 11:5; 1 Peter 2:9-10; Rev 1:6, 5:10).
 Therefore, the few isolated texts that appear to restrict the full
 redemptive freedom of women must not be interpreted simplistically
 and in contradiction to the rest of Scripture, but their
 interpretation must take into account their relation to the broader
 teaching of Scripture and their total context (1 Cor 11:2-16,
 14:33-36; 1 Tim 2:9-15).

\10. The Bible defines the function of leadership as the
 empowerment of others for service rather than as the exercise of
 power over them (Matt 20:25-28, 23:8; Mark 10:42-45; John 13:13-17;
 Gal 5:13; 1 Peter 5:2-3).

Family
\11. The Bible teaches that husbands and wives are heirs together
 of the grace of life and that they are bound together in a
 relationship of mutual submission and responsibility (1 Cor 7:3-5;
 Eph 5:21; 1 Peter 3:1-7; Gen 21:12). The husband’s function as
 “head” (kephalē) (Greek: κεφαλή, "head" (anatomical upper part of
 the human body that contains the face and brains), is to be
 understood as self-giving love and service within this relationship
 of mutual submission (Eph 5:21-33; Col 3:19; 1 Peter 3:7).

\12. The Bible teaches that both mothers and fathers are to
 exercise leadership in the nurture, training, discipline and
 teaching of their children (Ex 20:12; Lev 19:3; Deut 6:6-9,
 21:18-21, 27:16; Prov 1:8, 6:20; Eph 6:1-4; Col 3:20; 2 Tim 1:5;
 see also Luke 2:51).
