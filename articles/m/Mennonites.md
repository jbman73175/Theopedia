**Mennonites** are a Protestant religious group descended from the
16th century Anabaptists, taking their name from
[Menno Simons](Menno_Simons "Menno Simons"), a Dutch Roman Catholic
priest converted to the [Anabaptist](Anabaptist "Anabaptist")
faith. Menno Simons was active in the Netherlands and also
developed a following in Holstein and along the lower Rhine and the
Baltic.

The Mennonites rejected infant baptism, the swearing of oaths,
military service, and worldliness. They practiced strong church
discipline in their congregations and lived simple lives in
emulation of the earliest Christians. As summarized by the
Dordrecht Confession of 1632, Mennonite theological principles
stress the direct influence of the Holy Spirit on the heart of the
believer and the importance of the Bible, with its message of
salvation through the mystical experience of Christ's presence in
the heart.

Because Mennonites refused to assume state offices, to serve as
police or soldiers, or to take oaths of loyalty, they were
considered subversive and as such were severely persecuted. These
persecutions led at various times to the emigration of Mennonite
groups, e.g. to the American colonies (circa 1683), where they
settled in Pennsylvania.

In the Colonies, the Mennonites branched into several groups, of
which the (Old) Mennonite Church is the parent. Other groups
include the General Conference Mennonite Church and the Mennonite
Brethren Church. The Amish Church, named for Jacob Ammann, a 17th
century Swiss Mennonite bishop, remains insular and conservative.
