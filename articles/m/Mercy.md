The term **mercy** may designate both character and actions that
emerge as a consequence of that character. As a part of character,
mercy is demonstrated most clearly by such qualities as compassion
and forbearance. With respect to action an act of mercy issues from
compassion and forbearance; in a legal sense mercy may involve such
acts as pardon, forgiveness, or the mitigation of
penalties.^[[1]](#note-0)^ In each case mercy is experienced and
exercised by a person who has another person in his power, or under
his authority, or from whom no kindness can be claimed. Thus God
may show mercy toward human beings, who are all ultimately within
his power, even though they have no direct claim, in terms of their
behavior, to attitudes or actions of mercy. And a human being may
be merciful another, to whom neither compassion nor forbearance is
due, by free act of though toward that person.^[[2]](#note-1)^

From a theological perspective the characteristic of mercy is
rooted in God and experienced in relation to God, from whom it may
be acquired as a Christian virtue and exercised in relation to
fellow human beings.^[[3]](#note-2)^ In the Bible a variety of
Hebrew and Greek words are used which fall within the general
semantic range of the English word "mercy." They include such terms
as "lovingkindness" (Heb. *ḥesed*), "to be merciful" (Heb.
*ḥānan*), "to have compassion" (Heb. *riḥam*), and "grace" (Gr.
*charis*).^[[4]](#note-3)^

In the OT, mercy (in the sense of lovingkindness) is a central
theme; the very existence of the covenant between God and Israel
was an example of mercy, being granted to Israel freely and without
prior obligation on the part of God (Ps. 79:8-9; Isa. 63:7).
Insofar as the covenant was rooted in divine love, mercy was an
ever-present quality of the relationship it expressed; the law,
which formed a central part of the covenant relationship, cam with
the promise of forgiveness and mercy, contingent upon repentance,
for the breaking of that law.^[[5]](#note-4)^ Yet the divine mercy
extended beyond the obligations of the covenant, so that even when
Israel's sin had exhausted the covenantal category of mercy, still
the loving mercy of God reached beyond the broken covenant in its
promise and compassion to Israel.^[[6]](#note-5)^

With the new covenant the mercy of God is seen in the death of
Jesus Christ; the sacrificial death is in itself a merciful act,
demonstrating the divine compassion and making possible the
forgiveness of sins. From this fundamental gospel there follows the
requirement for all Christians, who are by definition the
recipients of mercy, to exercise mercy and compassion toward fellow
human beings (Matt. 5:7; James 2:13).^[[7]](#note-6)^

Throughout Christian history the awareness of the continuing human
need for divine mercy has remained as a central part of Christian
worship. The kyrie eleison of the ancient church has continued to
be used in many liturgical forms of worship: "Lord, have mercy upon
us; Christ, have mercy upon us; Lord have mercy upon us." And from
the prayer emploed in worship for God's mercy, there must follow
the practice of mercy in life.^[[8]](#note-7)^
