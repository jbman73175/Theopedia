The [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew") word **Messiah** (משׁיח), translated
in English as "the Lord's anointed" or simply "the anointed one,"
was used to refer to [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament")
figures such as [Saul](Saul "Saul") and [David](David "David") who
were anointed by [God](God "God"), but can also be understood
typologically to refer to [Christ](Christ "Christ"), the
[Greek](Greek "Greek") translation of Messiah.
