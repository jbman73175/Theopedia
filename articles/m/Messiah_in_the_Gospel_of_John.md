The word χριστος (Christos), translated as both
[Messiah](Messiah "Messiah") and Christ, occurs 19 times in the
Gospel of John. ^[[1]](#note-0)^. The word is first used in the
prologue (1:17). Messiah was an OT expectation held by most
observant Jews, so there is particular significance that the first
time that Jesus is called the Messiah is where John contrasts Jesus
and the law of Moses.

Throughout the gospel, many people discuss whether Jesus is the
Messiah, and the discussions form part of the structure of the
first half of John. Early in the gospel, John declares that he is
not the Messiah, but that he is preparing the way (1:20-23). He
says it again later, in context to Jesus’ ministry eclipsing his,
and clearly indicates that Jesus was the Messiah whom he was
preparing the way for (3:26-30). John pointed his disciples towards
Jesus very early in the gospel, and they also believed that he was
the Messiah (1:41, 49). By chapter 4, people outside of the circle
of disciples were beginning to suspect that Jesus was the Messiah.
Significantly, the first was a Samaritan woman (4:29). After the
feeding of the 5000, the Galileans attempt to make Jesus King
through force, which is a clear reference to the kingly
expectations of the Messiah (6:15). Chapter 7 contains an extended
discussion amongst the crowds in Jerusalem about Jesus, and the
focal point is whether he is the Messiah. Many of the people
believe that he is, and others believe that he is not (7:41-44). In
the raising of Lazarus – which is a critical point in the Gospel –
Mary declares that Jesus is the Messiah (11:27).

Throughout this discussion, Jesus only directly declares himself to
be the Messiah once – to the Samaritan woman (4:25-26). However, as
public opinion develops, he engages with their concerns and reasons
not to believe. In chapter 7, he engages with the discussion about
the Messiah’s origin – some thought that his origin would be a
mystery, some thought it would be Bethlehem (7:26-27, 41). In
response, he declares that do know his origin, but implies that
they do not, because he is from God (7:28-29). Finally, Jesus is
asked the direct question, and he declares again that his works are
the proof that he is the Messiah (10:24-25 cf. 7:30). The reasons
for this gradual revelation are most likely the same as the reasons
for the
[messianic secret](index.php?title=Messianic_secret&action=edit&redlink=1 "Messianic secret (page does not exist)")
in the [synoptic Gospels](Synoptic_Gospels "Synoptic Gospels"). One
of these is that public expectations of the Messiah were military,
and people claiming to be the Messiah often started armed
revolutions (ie. Bar Kokhba. cf. John 6:15).

The climax of the debate comes at the end of the first half – in
the triumphal entry. There Jesus publically fulfils Messianic
prophecy, and the crowd declares him to be the ‘King of Israel’
(12:12 ff.). However, the summary in 13:37 ff. showed that, though
some put their faith in Jesus, most did not. Of those who did, many
hid their faith because they were afraid of the authorities who had
declared that anyone supporting Jesus would be expelled from the
synagogue (7:13, 9:22, 12:42-42). This mounting opposition led to
Jesus trial, and his claim to be the Messiah was the central charge
against him before Pilate. Though Jesus refuses to answer directly,
Pilate constantly calls him a King, and that is what is written on
the notice on the cross. John also shows that Jesus death, by
gathering the people of God, fulfils the prophetic expectations for
the messiah (11:51-52, 12:32).

These constant discussions throughout the book show that, more than
any other Gospel, John is concerned about showing Jesus to be the
fulfilment of Israel’s messianic expectations. In the later part of
the Gospel, he reveals why:

This is eternal life: that they may know You, the only true God,
and the One You have sent-- Jesus Christ. John 17:3 (HCSB)
But these are written so that you may believe Jesus is the Messiah,
the Son of God, and by believing you may have life in His name.
John 20:31 (HCSB)
John clearly links eternal life to understanding that Jesus is the
Messiah. The language is not exclusive, and so cannot be read as
supplying a universal ‘requirement’ for salvation for all people.
However, throughout the book, those who believe that he is the
Messiah choose to follow him, and those who do not reject him.
