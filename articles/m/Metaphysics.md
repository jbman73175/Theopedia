It is quite difficult to come up with a strict definition of
**metaphysics**, however, it can be understood as a term in
philosophy that generally denotes the exploration of
[ontology](Ontology "Ontology") (the study of being, or what-is)
and the study of what is real. It was termed by
[Aristotle](index.php?title=Aristotle&action=edit&redlink=1 "Aristotle (page does not exist)")
in the first-century B.C. as a title for a group of his works. One
of these groups was about "the things of nature", titled *physics*.
The other group was simply called "the book after physics" by
ancient editors (*meta*, meaning "after"). Thus, metaphysics
literally means "after physics".

Questions generally asked in metaphysics are,

-   What is there? (known as the fundamental question in
    metaphysics)
-   What is ultimately real?
-   What is the difference between being and non-being?
-   Are there substances, and if so, what are they?
-   What is freedom? Is it real?
-   Is matter real, and if so, what is it?
-   Do humans have minds as well as bodies?

Some of these questions are fundamental when seeking to understand
the [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"). Using metaphysics to understand what
[substance](Substance "Substance") means can help make more clear
the nature of God. Although metaphysics can add support to the
study of the Trinity, the understanding of the nature of God should
ultimately be grounded in [Scripture](Scripture "Scripture").
