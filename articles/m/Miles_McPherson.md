**Miles McPherson** is pastor of The Rock Church, San Diego CA. He
also has a ministry called [Miles Ahead](http://www.milesahead.com)
which seeks to share the gospel with youth all over the country. As
part of this vision, Miles has begun
[Four Stories Tall](http://www.fourstoriestall.com) where he hopes
to have a documentary TV program where real life stories of young
people going through crisis are shared. Each episode will show the
relevance of the gospel, [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"), and faith admidst
the [suffering](Suffering "Suffering") that all youth encounter.
The website and TV show are still up and coming, and Miles' prayer
and vision is to see this hit MTV.
