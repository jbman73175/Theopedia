The **Millennial kingdom** refers to the *thousand-year* reign of
[Christ](Jesus "Jesus") specifically mentioned in
[Revelation](Revelation "Revelation") 20:1-6. This is usually seen
as the same Messianic Kingdom anticipated by the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament")
[prophets](Prophet "Prophet"). The major views regarding this
millennial kingdom follow:

-   Dispensational premillennialists propose that Christ's return
    will precede the millennium but will be in two stages: First, to
    [rapture](Rapture "Rapture") his saints, leaving all others behind,
    and then after seven years of tribulation, to publicly institute
    his visible millennial reign.
    [Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") also has
    a uniquely Jewish view of the millennium in which God will
    literally fulfill his OT promises to ethnic Israel, promises not
    given to Gentile believers.
-   Historic premillennialists, following some of the early church
    fathers, teach that the return of Christ will precede a literal
    thousand years of peace in which Christ would reign upon earth.
-   Postmillennialists generally see the millennial kingdom as a
    "golden age" ushered in by the church through the triumph of the
    gospel, not only in bringing individuals to salvation, but also in
    dominating culture. In this view, Christ's return is at the
    culmination (conclusion) of this millennial age, hence the name
    post-millennial.
-   Amillennialists believe that the "thousand years" of Revelation
    20 is a figurative number indicating the whole period between
    Jesus' resurrection and his return (i.e. the current church age).
    In this view Christ now reigns and rules from heaven in and through
    the church bringing people into the kingdom of God through the
    preaching of the gospel.

**Favored hermeneutic**
Strict-literal
Grammatico-historical
Covenant-historical
Redemptive-historical
**Israel and the church**
Views church and Israel as two distinct peoples of God with two
purposes and two destinies.
The church is the fulfillment of Israel.
The church is the fulfillment of Israel.
The church is the eschatological fulfillment of Israel.
**The rapture**
The church is raptured before a seven-year tribulation (the
seventieth week of Daniel - Daniel 9:24-27). This tribulational
period contains the reign of the AntiChrist.
The saints, living and dead, shall meet the Lord in the clouds as
he comes to earth to commence the millennial reign.
The rapture is temporally coincident with the Second Coming, both
of which occur at the end of the church age
The saints, living and dead, shall meet the Lord in the clouds and
immediately proceed to judge the nations with Christ and then
follow Him into their eternal state.
**Kingdom of God**
The literal physical kingdom reign, anticipated by the OT prophets,
during which God will fulfill all the OT promises to ethnic Israel.
The literal physical kingdom reign anticipated by the OT and NT
prophets.
A spiritual entity experienced on earth through the Christianizing
effect of the Gospel.
A spiritual reality in which all Christians partake presently by
faith, but by sight at the consummation.
**Millennium**
Christ will return at the end of the great tribulation to institute
a thousand-year earthly rule from Jerusalem. Those who begin
believing in Christ during the "seventieth week of Daniel" and
survive the tribulation will go on to populate the earth during
this time. Those raptured or raised prior to the tribulation will
reign with Christ over the millennial population. This view sees
the re-establishment of temple worship and animal sacrifices as a
remembrance of Christ's sacrifice.
Christ will return to institute a thousand-year reign on earth.
A "golden age" leading up to Christ's second advent during which
Christ will virtually rule over the whole earth through an
unprecedented spread of the Gospel; the large majority of people
will become Christian.
Inaugurated with Christ's resurrection. In an "already/not yet"
sense, Christ already reigns over all and is already victorious
over Satan.

## Dispensational Premillennialism

"Dispensational premillennialists hold that Christ will come before
a seven-year period of intense tribulation to take His church
(living and dead) into heaven. After this period of fulfillment of
divine wrath, He shall then return to rule from a holy city (i.e.,
the New Jerusalem) over the earthly nations for one thousand years.
After these thousand years, Satan, who was bound up during Christ's
earthly reign, will be loosed to deceive the nations, gather an
army of the deceived, and take up to battle against the Lord. This
battle will end in both the judgment of the wicked and Satan and
the entrance into the eternal state of glory by the righteous. This
view is called premillenialism because it places the return of
Christ before the millennium and it is called dispensational
because it is founded in the doctrines of dispensationalism."

*See main page: [Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") and [Premillennialism](Premillennialism "Premillennialism")*
## Historic Premillennialism

"Historic premillennialists place the return of Christ just before
the millennium and just after a time of great apostasy and
tribulation. After the millennium, Satan will be loosed and Gog and
Magog will rise against the kingdom of God; this will be
immediately followed by the final judgment. While similar in some
respects to the dispensational variety (in that they hold to
Christ's return being previous the establishment of a thousand-year
earthly reign), historical premillennialism differs in significant
ways (notably in their method of interpreting Scripture)."
[[2]](http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/mill.html)

*See main page: [Premillennialism](Premillennialism "Premillennialism")*
## Postmillennialism

"The postmillennialist believes that the millennium is an era (not
necessarily a literal thousand years) during which Christ will
reign over the earth, not from a literal and earthly throne, but
through the gradual increase of the Gospel and its power to change
lives. After this gradual Christianization of the world, Christ
will return and immediately usher the church into their eternal
state after judging the wicked. This is called postmillennialism
because, by its view, Christ will return after the millennium."
[[3]](http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/mill.html)

*See main page: [Postmillennialism](Postmillennialism "Postmillennialism")*
## Amillennialism

"The amillennialist believes that the Kingdom of God was
inaugurated at Christ's resurrection (hence the term "inaugurated
millennialism") at which point he gained victory over both Satan
and the Curse. Christ is even now reigning (hence the term
"nunc-millennialism" â€” nunc means "now") at the right hand of the
Father over His church. After this present age has ended, Christ
will return and immediately usher the church into their eternal
state after judging the wicked. The term "amillennialism" is
actually a misnomer for it implies that Revelation 20:1-6 is
ignored; in fact, the amillennialist's hermeneutic interprets it
(and in fact, much of apocalyptic literature) non-literally."
[[4]](http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/mill.html)

*See main page: [Amillennialism](Amillennialism "Amillennialism")*
## Preterism

Preterism rejects the idea of a future earthly millennial Kingdom
in which Christ physically reigns, and also holds that much of the
the Last Days (or End Times) prophecies were fulfilled in the Roman
destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish state in A.D. 70.
Consequently, Preterists are usually Amillennial or Postmillennial
in their [eschatology](Eschatology "Eschatology"). The term
"preterism" has its roots in the Latin word *praeter*, meaning
"past."

There are two major schools of Preterist thought: Partial
Preterism, usually seen as within [orthodox](Orthodox "Orthodox")
theology, and Full Preterism, often seen as outside of orthodoxy
since it specifically views the
[Second coming](Second_coming "Second coming") as already
fulfilled.
