This graphic demonstrates how God reaches into the Natural Realm,
and how Satanic forces reach into the Natural Realm. Notice that
God's actions begin outside the Supernatural realm, because He is
not bound by it.
A **miracle**, broadly defined, is any action in time where the
normal operation of nature is suspended by the agency of a
supernatural action.
