The **miracles of Jesus** comprise all of the super-natural events
that are found and attributed to him in Scripture. Examples include
Jesus walking on water, the raising of
[Lazarus](index.php?title=Lazarus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lazarus (page does not exist)"),
or the [resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection"). Jesus' miracles
are also known as signs (especially in
[John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John"); cf. John 2:1-11) and
mighty works (John 10:25-28).
