## Good people go to heaven

**False:** Getting to heaven is all about who you know (Matthew
7:21-23) not what you know (1 Cor 1:19) nor how good you are
(Romans 3:23:24). So if you want to go to heaven, put your energy
into getting to know God, and his son Jesus, and you will discover
that he is already drawing you to himself. And as you get to know
him, love him, and allow him to rule, then you will "grow" goodness
like a grapevine grows grapes (Galatians 5:22).

## God helps those who help themselves

**False:** This phrase is not from the bible but rather from
Aesop's fable
*[Hercules and the Waggoner](http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/61.html)*
which was written around the sixth century BC.

The Bible says basically the opposite: that God helps those who
*cannot* help themselves: "You see, at just the right time, when we
were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly" (Romans 5:6).
And that means all of us, by the way, because none of us, by our
own power, can help ourselves to the
[kingdom of God](Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God") (Romans 3:20).

This is not to say that Christians are to be passive –
[St. Paul](Paul "Paul") compares Christian
[discipleship](Discipleship "Discipleship") to running the
marathon: "Run in such a way as to get the prize" (1 Cor 9:24). To
avoid inadvertently trying to "lead", "manage", or otherwise
"dominate" God, however (surely a futile and dangerous
undertaking), we must cultivate the ability to be weak before him.
God said it to St. Paul this way: "My grace is sufficient for you,
for my power is made perfect in weakness" (2 Cor 12:9).

## Jesus would never judge anyone

**False:** The Bible says that Jesus will judge us all [John 5:22,
Acts 10:42]. Some people want to believe that Jesus is just too
nice a guy to pass judgement on people. Others refer to his
statements about not coming to judge [John 8:15-16, John 12:47],
and point out that his ministry was marked by repeated acts of
mercy and grace [e.g. John 4:16-26, John 8:11]. Put together, these
passages tell us that Jesus temporarily set aside his mandate to
judge us so that he could come as saviour and redeemer, but that on
the appointed day of judgement, it will be Jesus in the judgement
seat [Acts 17:31].

## Only the King James Bible is correct

**False:** The Bible is made up of books that were originally
written in Hebrew and Greek; all English bibles are translations.
We know from 2 Timothy 3:16 that God was profoundly involved in the
creation of these books and many Christians trust that he remains
involved as new translations are produced. We see the guidance of
God in the King James translation, and we love the poetic
phrasings, but there is no scriptural reason to believe that this
is the only "inspired" translation.

## The Adam and Eve story is really about sex

**False:** Adam and Eve's *nakedness* is not about sex, it is about
innocence. The Bible says that they were "naked and not ashamed"
(Genesis 2:25) – not in the brazen way that an exotic dancer today
might be "naked and not ashamed" but in a remarkably pure and
simple abscence of any kind of sin. Additionally, God's command to
Adam and Eve was to "be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28), a
command which was given during creation, not after the fall,
demonstrating that sex, in and of itself is a pure act when done
within the boundaries God has set.

Nor was the choice to *eat the forbidden fruit* about sex; it was
about something far more profound. It was about our choice to doubt
God's word ("Did God really say..." Genesis 3:1), disobey it ("they
ate it" Genesis 3:6-7), and choose instead to be little gods
ourselves ("...you will be like God..." Genesis 3:5). Eating the
fruit is thus all about [sin](Sin "Sin"), not about sex.

## When good people die they become angels

**False:** As charming as this idea is, there is little evidence
for it in the Bible. Angels are a separate order of beings (2 Peter
2:4) that were created before humans (Luke 10:18), are at home in
spiritual domains (Matthew 25:31), and act as messengers or
soldiers for the [Kingdom of God](Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God").
Although Jesus draws a comparison between risen people and angels
(Mark 12:25), he only does so to clarify a comment about marriage
and eternal life.

The heaven that awaits those who know God, when they die, is a far
greater prize than a chance to be an angel.

## Scripture is threatened by science

**False:** Jeremiah 31:35-36 says that God has established the laws
(Hebrew *chuqqah* often translated "decrees") of physics, and
Christians see God's handiwork as much in the patterns and laws
that have been discovered as in the mysteries that remain. The
Bible is thus not threatened by the scientific drive to map out the
patterns in creation.

The Bible disagrees with scientists who teach that the universe was
an accident, asserting instead that it is God's treasured creation
(Genesis 1:31) that continues to be held together by his Spirit
(Colossians 1:17). Because science is restricted to a study of
God's creation, it has no mechanism for gathering evidence for, nor
disproving the existence of, a creator that is outside of
creation.
