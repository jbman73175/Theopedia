According to one scholarly review of
[Bart Ehrman's](Bart_Ehrman "Bart Ehrman") book,
*Misquoting Jesus*, "there is nothing earth-shaking in the first
four chapters of the book. Rather, it is in the introduction that
we see Ehrman's motive, and the last three chapters reveal his
agenda."^[[1]](#note-0)^ He notes that "almost none of the variants
that Ehrman discusses involve sayings by
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")"^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Quotes from the book

-   "It would be wrong to say as people sometimes do that the
    changes in our text have no real bearing on what the texts mean or
    on the theological conclusions that one draws from them. We have
    seen, in fact, that just the opposite is the case."
