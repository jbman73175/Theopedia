**Missional** is a popular term often used to describe a missionary
lifestyle. It can be used to describe
[discipleship](Discipleship "Discipleship"),
[leadership](Leadership "Leadership"), a [church](Church "Church"),
etc. but is generally used in contrast to professional
missionaries. In essence, proponents claim that missional living is
to be expected of all true followers of Jesus in which all are
engaged in obeying the
[Great commission](Great_commission "Great commission").
