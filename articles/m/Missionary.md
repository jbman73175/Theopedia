A **missionary** is one who is sent on a mission, especially one
sent to do religious or charitable work in a territory or foreign
country. The Latin root from which the word "missionary" is derived
is equivalent to the Greek word *apostolos*
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#652](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=652&version=nas)]*^),
meaning "one sent forth", from which we get "apostle". It has been
defined as one who attempts to persuade or convert others to a
particular faith (or set of beliefs)
[[1]](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/missionary); often an
[evangelist](Evangelism "Evangelism") or other representative of a
religious community who works among those outside of that
community.

The term is most commonly used to refer to
[Christian](Christian "Christian") missionaries, although it can
generally apply to proselytizing of any creed or ideology.
