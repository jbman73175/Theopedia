**Missions**, also known as **missiology**, is the area of
[practical theology](Practical_theology "Practical theology") which
studies the mandate, message and work of the Christian
[missionary](Missionary "Missionary"). It is a multi-disciplinary
and cross-cultural reflection on all aspects of the spread of the
Christian faith, embracing theology, anthropology, history,
geography, theories and methods of communication, comparative
religion, Christian apologetics, methodology, and
inter-denominational relations. Because missiology considers both
the positive and the negative consequences, as well as the
strategies of the spread of Christianity, missiology also touches
on the environmental impact of evangelization and charitable work,
including practical facets of international politics and economic
development.

One of missiology's most difficult challenges is to distinguish
between Christian practices that are essential to Christianity and
therefore must be practiced by Christians in all cultures, and
other strictly cultural expressions of Christianity that can be
changed and adapted to a different culture.
