**Modalism**, also called **Sabellianism**, is the unorthodox
belief that [God](God "God") is one person who has revealed himself
in three forms or *modes* in contrast to the
[Trinitarian](Trinity "Trinity") doctrine where God is one being
eternally existing in three persons. According to Modalism, during
the [incarnation](Incarnation "Incarnation"),
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") was simply God acting in one mode or role,
and the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") at Pentecost was
God acting in a different mode. Thus, God does not exist as the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit at the same time. Rather, He is one
person and has merely manifested himself in these three modes at
various times. Modalism thus denies the basic distinctiveness and
coexistence of the three persons of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity").

Modalism was condemned by [Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian") (c.
213, *Tertullian Against Praxeas* 1, in Ante Nicene Fathers, vol.
3). Also known as Sabellianism, it was condemned as
[heresy](Heresy "Heresy") by Dionysius, bishop of Rome (c. 262).

Modalism is probably the most common theological error concerning
the [nature](Nature "Nature") of God (i.e., who God is). "Present
day groups that hold to forms of this error are the United
Pentecostal and United Apostolic Churches. They deny the Trinity,
teach that the name of God is Jesus... modalist churches often
accuse Trinitarians of teaching
[three gods](Polytheism "Polytheism"). This is not what the Trinity
is. The correct teaching of the Trinity is one God in three eternal
coexistent persons: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."
