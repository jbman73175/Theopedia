**Modernism** is the worldview ushered in by the
[Enlightenment](Enlightenment "Enlightenment"). The Enlightenment
provided a new guardian of truth to replace the church -- science.
Modernism therefore proffered the idea that mankind, armed with
rationalism and science, is able to access absolute truth and make
unlimited progress toward a better life for itself. Therefore, at
its core, modernity is a celebration of human autonomy.

Some have conjectured that while the roots of modernity were
evident many years before, the actual birth of modernism was in
1789 at the fall of the Bastille in France during the French
Revolution. Gene Veith reasons, "The French Revolution exemplifies
the triumph of the Enlightenment. With the destruction of the
Bastille, the prison in which the monarchy jailed its political
prisoners, the pre-modern world with its feudal loyalties and
spiritual hierarchies was guillotined. The revolutionaries exalted
the Rights of Man. They dismissed Christianity as a relic of the
past. During the course of the revolution, they installed the
Goddess of Reason in Notre Dame Cathedral." ^[1](#References)^
