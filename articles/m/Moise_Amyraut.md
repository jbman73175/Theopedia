Moise Amyraut
**Mo√Øse Amyraut**, or Moses Amyraldus, (1596-1664), was a notable
17th century French Protestant theologian. As pastor of Saumur (in
France) he won a reputation as both theologian and orator. He
became professor of theology at Saumur in 1633 and wrote
extensively on theological subjects. He is perhaps most noted for
his modifications to [Calvinist theology](Calvinism "Calvinism")
regarding the nature of Christ's
[atonement](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ"), which is
referred to as [Amyraldism](Amyraldism "Amyraldism") or
Amyraldianism.
