Moisés Silva
**Moisés Silva** (b. 1945) is an author, editor, and former
professor of biblical studies. He taught at Westmont College
(1972-1981),
[Westminster Theological Seminary](Westminster_Theological_Seminary "Westminster Theological Seminary")
(1981-1996), and

(1996-2000).

He earned his ThM at Westminster Seminary and received a PhD at the

influenced his own work on *Biblical Words and Their Meaning*,
challenging common linguistic fallacies in biblical interpretation.
A past president of the Evangelical Theological Society (1997),
Silva was one of the translators of the
[New American Standard Bible](New_American_Standard_Bible "New American Standard Bible")
and the recent
