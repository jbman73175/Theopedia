**Molinism** is an attempt to provide a solution to the classic
philosophical problems associated with God's
[providence](Providence "Providence"),
[foreknowledge](Foreknowledge "Foreknowledge") and the
[freedom](Free_will "Free will") of humanity. This view may be
traced to the 16th century Jesuit theologian Luis de Molina -
hence, the name *Molinism*. Specifically, it seeks to maintain a
strong view of
[God's sovereignty](Sovereignty_of_God "Sovereignty of God") over
creation while at the same time preserving the belief that human
beings have self-determined freedom, or
[libertarian free will](Libertarian_free_will "Libertarian free will").

"Molina's doctrine is called *scientia media*, or middle knowledge,
because it stands in the middle of the two traditional categories
of divine epistemology as handed down by
[Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas"), natural and free
knowledge. It shares characteristics of each and, in the logical
order of the divine deliberative process regarding creation, it
follows natural knowledge but precedes free
knowledge."^[[1]](#note-0)^

"Luis de Molina’s solution to the freedom/foreknowledge dilemma has
had a revival of sorts in the latter half of the twentieth century,
most notably through the efforts of
[William Lane Craig](William_Lane_Craig "William Lane Craig"),
Alfred Freddoso, Jonathan Kvanvig, Thomas Flint, and
[Alvin Plantinga](Alvin_Plantinga "Alvin Plantinga"). In short,
these thinkers have followed the Jesuit Counter-Reformer in
postulating a middle knowledge between God’s natural and free
knowledge." ^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Variations of God's knowledge

"The most famous distinctive in Molinism is its affirmation that
God has middle knowledge (*scienta media*). Molinism holds that
God’s knowledge consists of *three* logical moments. These
“moments” of knowledge are not to be thought of as chronological;
rather they are to be understood as “logical.” In other words, one
moment does not come before another moment in time, rather one
moment is logically prior to the other moments. The Molinist
differentiates between three different moments of knowledge which
are respectively called natural knowledge, middle knowledge and
free knowledge."^[[3]](#note-2)^

-   **Natural Knowledge** – This is God’s knowledge of all
    necessary and all possible truths. In this “moment” God knows every
    possible combination of causes and effects. He also knows all the
    truths of logic and all moral truths.

-   **Middle Knowledge** – This is God’s knowledge of what any free
    creature would do in any given circumstance, also known as
    counterfactual knowledge. It is also sometimes stated as God's
    knowledge of the truth of subjunctive conditionals.

-   **Free Knowledge** – This is God’s knowledge of what He freely
    decided to create. God’s free knowledge is His knowledge of the
    actual world as it is.

## God's knowledge and the decreed creation

The following is a synopsis of the logical order postulated in
Molinism, relating the aspects (or moments) of God's knowledge to
the world He chose to create.

1.  God's knowledge of all possible and necessary truths (natural
    knowledge -- of what could happen).
2.  God's knowledge of all feasible worlds (middle knowledge -- of
    what would happen through free choices under certain circumstances,
    including counterfactuals).
3.  Divine decree to create His selected world.
4.  God's Foreknowledge set through His selected decree (free
    knowledge -- of what will come to pass).

Postulating a middle knowledge and placing it between God's
knowledge of necessary truths and God's creative decree is crucial
to the Molinist scheme. By placing middle knowledge (and thus
counterfactuals) before the creation decree, God conceivably allows
for man's freedom in the libertarian sense. Placing this middle
knowledge logically after necessary truths but before the creation
decree also allows God to survey all feasible worlds and decide
which world to actualize.

"Biblically speaking, Molinists are more in line with the Arminian
view. God chooses who will be saved because He knows who would
choose Him. However, Molinists are more philosophically
sophisticated than the typical Arminian. For example, William Lane
Craig avoids the criticism that God’s decisions are dependent on
man’s decisions by holding that God’s middle knowledge is not
derived from His knowledge of the world. Rather, God’s middle
knowledge is based on His existing natural knowledge. In this way
he hopes to uphold God’s perfect omniscience. So, today’s
evangelical Molinists are basically philosophically sophisticated
[Arminians](Arminianism "Arminianism")."^[[4]](#note-3)^
