**Monergism** (Greek *mono* meaning "one" and *erg* meaning "work")
is a term for the belief that the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") is the only agent who
effects regeneration of Christians. This view, held by Reformed and
Calvinistic groups, sees salvation as the work of God alone, from
first to last. He has chosen in eternity past whom He will save out
of lost humanity (often referred to as the
[elect](Election "Election")), and in His timing He will bring the
elect to faith through the work of the Spirit for the sake of the
Son, and save them forever to the praise of His glorious grace
(Romans 8:29f). This is opposed to the
[synergistic](Synergism "Synergism") view as held by
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism") and its theological
predecessor [Semi-Pelagianism](Semi-Pelagianism "Semi-Pelagianism")
where salvation is seen as a *cooperative effort* between God and
man.

Quoting John Hendryx, "Monergism simply means that it is God who
gives ears to hear and eyes to see. It is God alone who gives
illumination and understanding of His word that we might believe;
It is God who raises us from the dead, who circumcises the heart;
unplugs our ears; It is God alone who can give us a new sense that
we may, at last, have the moral capacity to behold His beauty and
unsurpassed excellency." -
