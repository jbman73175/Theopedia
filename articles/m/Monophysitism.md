**Monophysitism** (from the Greek **monos** meaning 'one' and
**physis** meaning 'nature') is the christological position that
Christ has only one nature, as opposed to the Chalcedonian position
which holds that Christ has two natures, one divine and one human.
There are two major doctrines that can undisputedly be called
**monophysite**:

-   [Eutychianism](Eutychianism "Eutychianism") holds that the
    human nature of Christ was essentially obliterated by the Divine,
    "dissolved like a drop of honey in the sea".
-   [Apollinarianism](Apollinarianism "Apollinarianism") holds that
    Christ had a human body and human "living principle" but that the
    Divine Logos had taken the place of the *nous*, or "thinking
    principle", analogous but not identical to what might be called a
    [mind](Mind "Mind") in the present day.

The radical monophysitism of Eutyches emerged in Egypt as a
response to [Nestorianism](Nestorianism "Nestorianism"). It was
rejected at the
[Council of Chalcedon](Council_of_Chalcedon "Council of Chalcedon")
in 451 and is also rejected by the
[Oriental Orthodox](Oriental_Orthodox "Oriental Orthodox")
Churches.

Later, [monothelitism](Monothelitism "Monothelitism") was developed
as an attempt to bridge the gap between the monophysite and the
Chalcedonian position, but it too was rejected by the
Chalcedonians, despite at times having the support of the Byzantine
Emperors. Some are of the opinion that
[monothelitism](Monothelitism "Monothelitism") was at one time held
by the Maronites, but they, for the most part, dispute this,
stating that the Maronite Community has never been out of communion
with the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church").

[Miaphysitism](Miaphysitism "Miaphysitism"), the Christology of the
[Oriental Orthodox](Oriental_Orthodox "Oriental Orthodox")
Churches, is sometimes considered a variant of monophysitism, but
these Churches are at pains to distinguish their teaching from
monophysitism *per se*.
