**Monotheism** is the belief that there is but one
[God](God "God"). The term comes from the [Greek](Greek "Greek")
*monos* "only", and *theos* "god". Monotheism opposes
[polytheism](Polytheism "Polytheism"), the belief in more than one
God, and [atheism](Atheism "Atheism"), the belief that there is no
God. Other [worldviews](Worldview "Worldview") such as
[deism](Deism "Deism") (the belief that God created but does not
intervene in the world), and [pantheism](Pantheism "Pantheism")
(the belief that God is in all and that all is God), do maintain
that there is one God. However, the monotheism of Christ, formed by
the words of the Lord Jesus and His Father in Heaven as quoted
within the Holy Scripture, rejects these other worldviews,
maintaining that there is one God who does
[providentially](Providence_of_God "Providence of God") work within
the world, while remaining distinct from it. The Christian doctrine
of monotheism differs from those of [Islam](Islam "Islam") and
modern [Judaism](Judaism "Judaism") by maintaining a belief in
[Trinitarian](Trinity "Trinity") monotheism.
