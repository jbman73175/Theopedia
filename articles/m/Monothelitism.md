**Monothelitism** is the theological doctrine that Christ had only
*one will* even though he had two natures (human and divine). This
teaching was condemned as heretical in the Third Council of
Constantinople, which was the 6th
[Ecumenical Council](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils"), in
680-681.
