**Montanism** was an early [heresy](Heresy "Heresy"). The movement
was begun by *Montanus* in the second century, shortly after
Montanus' conversion to Christianity. He claimed to have received a
series of direct revelations from the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit"), or the *paraklete*, and
was joined by two women, Prisca and Maximilla. His teachings spread
from his native Phrygia, where he proclaimed the village of Pepuza
as the site of the *New Jerusalem* and threatened the church
hierarchy. The beliefs of Montanism included the belief that the
Trinity consisted of only a single person, similar to
[Sabellianism](Sabellianism "Sabellianism").

Although the mainstream Christian church prevailed against
Montanism within a few generations, inscriptions in the Tembris
valley of northern Phrygia, dated between 249 and 279, openly
proclaim their allegiance to Montanism. This sect persisted into
the eighth century.

The most widely known Montanist was undoubtedly
[Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian"), the early Church Father who
coined the term "*Trinity*" but who later rejected Christian
orthodoxy.
