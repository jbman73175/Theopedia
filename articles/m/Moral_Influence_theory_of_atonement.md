The **Moral influence theory** of the atonement is a doctrine in
Christian [theology](Theology "Theology") related to the meaning
and effect of the death of
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"). In this view, the
purpose and result of Christ's death was to influence mankind
toward moral improvement. This theory denies that Christ died to
satisfy any principle of divine justice, but teaches instead that
His death was designed to greatly impress mankind with a sense of
God's love, resulting in softening their hearts and leading them to
repentance. Thus, the Atonement is not directed towards God with
the purpose of maintaining His justice, but towards man with the
purpose of persuading him to right action.

Formulated by
[Peter Abelard](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Abelard "wikipedia:Peter Abelard")
(1079-1142) partially in reaction against
[Anselm](Anselm "Anselm")â€™s
[Satisfaction theory](Satisfaction_theory "Satisfaction theory"),
this view was held by the 16th century
[Socinians](Socinianism "Socinianism"). Versions of it can be found
later in
[Friedrich Schleiermacher](Friedrich_Schleiermacher "Friedrich Schleiermacher")
(1768-1834) and
[Horace Bushnell](Horace_Bushnell "Horace Bushnell") (1802-1876).
It was largely taught in
[liberal Christian](Liberalism "Liberalism") circles.
