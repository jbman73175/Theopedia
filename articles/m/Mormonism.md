Joseph Smith, founder of Mormonism
**Mormonism**, also known as
**The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints**, is a religion
with membership of 12,275,822 as of December 31, 2004, with 6.7
million residing outside the United States. Their headquarters are
stationed in Utah, where roughly 65% of the state are Latter-day
Saints (hereafter "LDS"). In a plethora of ways, Mormonism deviates
from Biblical, historic Christian beliefs.

## History

Although Mormonism began roughly 175 years ago in 1830, it's
history is rich and extensive. LDS pride themselves on their past,
especially on their founder
[Joseph Smith](Joseph_Smith "Joseph Smith"). LDS history is riddled
with many problems, and although most Mormons know much about their
history, they have either avoided or tend to be ignorant of the
many problems that exist. Such problems are: polygamy, racism,
deception, and murder, just to name a few. It is important to know
the basics of their history in order to understand the overall
thought of Mormonism, and although many problems exist, when
talking with Mormons one should be respectful as Scripture calls us
to be (1 Peter 3:15).

*See main pages: [History of the Mormon church](History_of_the_Mormon_church "History of the Mormon church")*
and *[Joseph Smith](Joseph_Smith "Joseph Smith")*
## Doctrine

The body of Mormon doctrine is a deep, tangled, and fascinating web
of teachings that strike at the heart of biblical Christianity.
Among other things, Mormons deny the unique
[nature of God](Attributes_of_God "Attributes of God") that makes
him distinctly worthy of worship, the design of
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") by [grace](Grace "Grace")
through [faith](Faith "Faith") apart from works, and the purpose of
the universe (to glorify the one God). It's thought is thoroughly
[Pelagian](Pelagian "Pelagian") and places an enormous emphasis on
one's worthiness and the appeal of maintaining the family unit in
the afterlife. Perhaps the most foundational component of their
doctrine is found in the following couplet, made by Mormon prophet
Lorenzo Snow: "As god once was, man is. As God is, man may
become."

*See main pages: [Doctrines of Mormonism](Doctrines_of_Mormonism "Doctrines of Mormonism"), [Deprecated doctrines within Mormonism](Deprecated_doctrines_within_Mormonism "Deprecated doctrines within Mormonism"), [Disputed doctrines within Mormonism](Disputed_doctrines_within_Mormonism "Disputed doctrines within Mormonism")*
## Historical development

Historically, Mormonism highly emphasized theological distinctives
from other churches. Today, a much smaller set of distinctives is
made and similarities are stressed with those who possess Christian
backgrounds and traditional moral values.

What has resulted is a theology that is different from what
historic Mormonism originally taught. This naturally flows out of
their belief in modern day revelation. Whenever a Mormon prophet
(or president) receives a revelation, it is binding on the church.
Sometimes little change is seen, however the effects of some
revelations have been monumental. The most explicit examples are
when blacks were finally given the right to hold the priesthood
(1978), and when polygamy was banned by Mormon President Wilford
Woodruff (1890). Mormon theology is still changing today,
especially in discussions concerning
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation").

*See main pages: [Development of Mormon theology](Development_of_Mormon_theology "Development of Mormon theology")*
and
*[Neo-Mormon theology](Neo-Mormon_theology "Neo-Mormon theology")*
## Culture

Part of the typical Mormon experience involves a tight-knit family
and social environment. It is often noted that Mormonism is more of
a culture than a religion. That is because the Mormon identity, or
"glue", is primarily the culture and not doctrine or theology.
While there are some basic, bedrock doctrines that unite Mormonism,
Mormons are generally [atheological](Atheological "Atheological").
Because of this, Mormons often have difficulty understanding the
significant differences between Mormonism and Christianity.

*See main page: [Mormon culture](Mormon_culture "Mormon culture")*
## Evangelism to Mormons

A variety of methods are used by evangelical Christians to
evangelize to the Mormons, many of which depend on one's view or
attitude toward: 1) The status of the Mormon people as either a
reached or unreached people group. 2) The Mormon's
self-understanding of doctrine. 3) The implications of
enculturation for methods of interacting with the people.

*See main page: [Evangelism to Mormons](Evangelism_to_Mormons "Evangelism to Mormons")*
## Quotes

-   "[M]ost LDS converts come from nominal Protestant and Catholic
    backgrounds, which makes sense given the way in which Mormon
    missionaries present their message. They offer a Restored Gospel, a
    term that is easy to understand if one already has an idea of what
    “gospel” means. LDS missionar­ies offer instruction to their
    prospective apostles, churches, beliefs, angels, God, Jesus, and
    Scripture—none of which make any sense unless the listeners and
    their ecclesiastical predecessors are the result of traditional
    Christian evangelism, catechism, and Bible study. The Bible used by
    LDS missionaries in their quest for converts, the King James
    Version, is a translation produced by non-LDS Christian scholars.
    Consequently, LDS success, according to Mosser, is parasitical on
    Catholic and Protestant missionary work, education, and
    scholarship." -
