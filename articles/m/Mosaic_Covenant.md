The **Mosaic Covenant** is found in
[Exodus](Book_of_Exodus "Book of Exodus") 19 through 24. In this
covenant, God promises:

-   To make Israel His special possession among the people of the
    land.
-   To make Israel a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. God
    followed this up with requirements and laws.
