**Moses** ([Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew"): *Moshe*) was an important
Hebrew lawgiver, leader and prophet who was appointed by God to
lead his people the [Israelites](Israelite "Israelite") out of
slavery in ancient Egypt. He is also recognized as the author of
the first five books of the Bible (known collectively as the
[Pentateuch](Pentateuch "Pentateuch") or the Torah):
[Genesis](Genesis "Genesis"), [Exodus](Exodus "Exodus"),
[Leviticus](Leviticus "Leviticus"), [Numbers](Numbers "Numbers"),
and most of [Deuteronomy](Deuteronomy "Deuteronomy"). Moses is not
only important to Christians, but also to Jews and Muslims.

## Early life

Moses, a Levite, was born in Egypt (see Ex. 2:1-2) to Amram and
Jochebed (Exodus 6:20) and was the younger brother of
[Aaron](Aaron "Aaron") and
[Miriam](index.php?title=Miriam&action=edit&redlink=1 "Miriam (page does not exist)")
(1 Chronicles 6:3). His family lived in the region of Goshen in the
Nile Delta, where, even under brutal slavery, the Israelites had
grown to a great multitude that the Egyptians eventually viewed
them as a national security threat (Exodus 1:12).

## Last years

Moses died on Mount Nebo while viewing the Promised Land. He was
120 years old when he died, yet "his eye was undimmed, and his
vigor unabated." The Lord buried Moses in the valley in the land of
Moab opposite Beth-peor, and to this day nobody knows where he is
buried." (Deuteronomy 34:7 ^[[1]](#note-0)^)
