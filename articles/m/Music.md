**Music** has been defined in the broadest terms as sounds
organized to express a wide variety of human emotions. The term
itself is derived from Greek *mousike* (the art of the Muses), but
historically music has been used for aesthetic, communicative,
entertainment, or ceremonial purposes. With nearly 150 passages
making reference in one form or another, the [Bible](Bible "Bible")
has a lot to say about music. One of the largest and most quoted
portions of Scripture is a collection of songs: the
[Book of Psalms](Book_of_Psalms "Book of Psalms").

## Purpose

Music in the Bible was never for personal gratification and
enjoyment. Rather, it is a gift from God, directed to God, in
response to his creative and redemptive acts, and designed for
God's glorification and enjoyment. Redeemed humans sing (Exodus
15:1-2; 2 Samuel 22:50; Psalm 30:4; 40:3; 95:1; 107:8; Ephesians
5:19; Revelation 19:6-8) and all of creation sings (Psalm 96:11-12;
98:8, 103:22; 104:12; Isaiah 35:2; 42:1-12; 44:23). The only time
angels are mentioned singing is in Job 38:7 (the rest of the
instances use the word "say" not "sing").

Music is also not used in the Bible for the purpose of evangelism.
The Gospel calls for pure, clear, forthright, intelligent and
persuasive presentation of the character of God, the condition of
man, and the cross of Christ. The primary vehicles for this message
are preaching and witness, both of which rely heavily on the spoken
word.

Other uses for music in the Bible:

-   to announce the judgment of God (Exodus 19:13-19, 20:18; Isaiah
    27:13; Zechariah 9:14; Matthew 24:31; I Corinthians 15:52; I
    Thessalonians 4:16; Hebrews 12:19; Revelation 8:2-9:14; 10:7; 11:5)
-   to instruct the Israelites to begin marching (Numbers 10:2-10)
-   to welcome a holy feast day (Leviticus 23:24)
-   to call the Israelists to battle (Judges 3:27)
-   to express sorrow, such as at a funeral (II Samuel 1:17-27)
-   to herald the anointing of a new king (II Samuel 15:10)
-   to express joy, such as at a wedding (Jeremiah 7:34)

## Character

One of the biggest issues that churches debate today is around
musical styles and preferences. Does the Bible address this
question?

### How shall we then sing?

... with voice and instruments (1 Chronicles 23:5; Psalm 33:2-3;
71:22-23; 144:9)
... with gladness (2 Chronicles 29:30)
... with a whole heart (Psalm 9:1)
... with thanksgiving (Psalm 147:7)
### Quantity vs. quality of sound?

"Make a joyful noise unto the Lord" - a phrase that occurs 7 times
in Psalms in the KJV (66:1; 81:1; 95:1-2; 98:4,6; 100:1) - has
often been used to justify cacophony in worship, but it is probably
mistranslated and would be better rendered "shout joyfully". God
does not delight in loud "noise" per se (as noise presupposes
unintelligible sound) but rather in jubilant song and triumphant
praise. This is underscored by Psalm 33:3 - " Sing to him a new
song; play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts."

Two places when Old Testament music degenerates to noise making:
Amos 5:23 "Take away from me the noise of your songs; to the melody
of your harps I will not listen." and Ezekiel 26:13 "And I will
stop the music of your songs, and the sound of your lyres shall be
heard no more." Unfortunately, the ESV translates the Hebrew word
*hâmôn* as music, when it is probably more correctly understood to
be "noise" or "tumult".

Music as noise in the New Testament occurs in Matthew 9 when Jesus
came to the house where there was a crowd of professional mourners,
and the gospel writer captures the incoherent sounds with the Greek
verb *thorubeō* meaning "tumult" or "clamor".

### "New" in age or "new" in quality?

Six times in the Psalms, once in Isaiah, and twice in Revelation,
the Bible speaks of singing "a new song", leading some to suggest
that the church and Christians must be constantly composing and
pushing the edge of musical styles. However, both the context and
the language make it clear that the "newness" of the song does not
rest in the lyrics or melody, but in the experience of the divine.

The Greek word used in Revelation 5:9 and 14:2 is *kainos*, in
contrast with the word *neos*. The Theological Dictionary of the
New Testament explains the difference: "*Neos* is what is new in
time or origin,... *kainos* is what is new in nature, different
from the usual, impressive, better than the old."
