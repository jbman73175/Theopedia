## New Perspective on Paul

N.T. Wright has been one of the most outspoken advocates of the
redefinition of the doctrine of justification, imputed
righteousness, and the idea of "exile" within first century
Judaism. Anyone wishing to understand the New Perspective on Paul
(NPP) should understand and be familiar with his writings as he is
the most widely read of any NPP writer.
