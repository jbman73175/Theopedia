The **Nag Hammadi Library**, a collection of thirteen ancient
codices containing over fifty texts, was discovered in upper Egypt
in 1945. This immensely important discovery includes a large number
of primary [Gnostic](Gnostic "Gnostic") scriptures -- texts once
thought to have been entirely destroyed during the early Christian
struggle to define "orthodoxy" -- scriptures such as the
[Gospel of Thomas](Gospel_of_Thomas "Gospel of Thomas"), the
[Gospel of Philip](Gospel_of_Philip "Gospel of Philip"), and the
[Gospel of Truth](index.php?title=Gospel_of_Truth&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gospel of Truth (page does not exist)").

## Dating the Library

[N.T. Wright](N.T._Wright "N.T. Wright") argues that, despite the
current fashion for preferring and even privileging the Gnostic
writings of Nag Hammadi as giving us access to Jesus himself, they
are

-   demonstrably late (late second century at the earliest), though
    they may contain traces of earlier material;
-   demonstrably derived from the earlier, and now
    [canonical](Development_of_the_NT_canon "Development of the NT canon"),
    material; and
-   demonstrably different in theology from that earlier material.

"The first two of these points are hotly contested, but my judgment
here is shared by many in the field. In particular, “Thomas” has
been touted in some parts of North America — not really anywhere
else so far as I know — as a major key for getting behind the
canonical gospels and in touch with the real Jesus, who it turns
out (according to some writers who take this line) is a figure much
more like Buddha, a teacher of a spiritual path, than one would
have thought from the canonical gospels. But there are many reasons
for drawing back from this conclusion. In particular, as quite a
strong index of where things stand, we note the language of the
book. “Thomas” as we have it is written in Coptic, an Egyptian
language of the time. It is simply a collection of sayings
attributed to Jesus; and, in the Coptic version, they are in no
particular order. But if we translate the Coptic back into Syriac,
the likely original language of the collection, we discover that in
Syriac the sayings of Jesus have been collected into a careful
pattern, with connecting words linking the different sayings each
to the next. And the Syriac in question, and the method of this
linking of sayings, is closely cognate with the language and style
of writers known to us from the late second century church, not
least Tatian. The strong probability is that the collection we call
“Thomas” was put together nearly 200 years after the time of Jesus
and not earlier."
## Gnostic derivatives of New Testament writings

An analysis of the differences between the Gnostic writings and New
Testament writings all indicate that it is the Nag Hammadi codices,
not the canonical gospels, which have succumbed to a shift away
from an early to a later viewpoint. In support of this, Wright
makes three points:

1.  the Nag Hammadi writings involve a massive step away from the
    Jewish context of Jesus’ ministry and towards some kind of Platonic
    viewpoint. Jesus’ idea of the Kingdom of God coming on earth as in
    heaven is transformed into a kingdom-teaching which is all about a
    private and detached spirituality. Whereas in the canonical gospels
    Jesus seems at several points to be calling his fellow Jews back to
    a genuine following of Israel’s God and the inner meaning of the
    Jewish law, in the Nag Hammadi codices Judaism, where it occurs at
    all, has become simply part of the problem. A particularly telling
    sentence in “Thomas” has Jesus declare, not that if the temple is
    destroyed it will be rebuilt, but that he will destroy the temple
    and no-one will be able to rebuild it. The Jesus of “Thomas” is at
    best non-Jewish, at worst anti-Jewish. This fits very neatly with
    the largely non-Jewish Jesus invented by Rudolf Bultmann and his
    followers, and reinvented by the now defunct “Jesus Seminar,” but
    not at all with any picture of Jesus which can be produced by
    serious and sober historical scholarship.
2.  the Nag Hammadi codices have taken a large step away from a
    narrative world and into detached aphorisms and isolated teachings.
    There is no attempt to tell the story of Jesus or even stories
    about him, or to see that story and those stories within the
    context of the larger story of God and the world, of God and
    Israel. They show all the signs of having been abstracted from that
    setting, as though someone were to go through Shakespeare’s plays
    and extract all the great one-liners without any attempt to show
    where they belong within the dramas of which they form part.
3.  in particular, they have seen Jesus not as the one who,
    climactically and decisively, died on the cross and rose again, but
    simply as a teacher. This is the heart of it all. They have made
    the message about Jesus not good news about something that has
    happened, but good advice as to how one might re-order one’s life.
    Actually, of course, the advice is not in fact that good. What then
    about the place of Mary Magdalene, who, according to Dan Brown and
    some other writers, features strongly in the Gnostic writings,
    representing a goddess-figure, the embodiment of the “sacred
    feminine,” the Holy Grail, the Rose, the Divine Mother? It is all
    pure imagination. (Well, it is at least imagination, certainly.)
    Mary Magdalene is mentioned in precisely three of the Nag Hammadi
    scrolls (as against “the countless references to Jesus’ and Mary
    Magdalene’s union” (333)). The “Gospel of Mary” is the report of a
    vision which sets the material world against the nonmaterial,
    seeing Mind as the intermediary of Soul and Spirit. This is fairly
    standard Platonic idealism; it is hard to see what it’s got to do
    with the sacred feminine, but it’s easy to see that it has nothing
    to do with a first-century Jewish prophetic movement such as that
    of Jesus. The
    “[Gospel of Philip](Gospel_of_Philip "Gospel of Philip")” is the
    one where Jesus kisses Mary — but the idea that a kiss was a key
    gesture of romantic attachment won’t survive two minutes when we
    move away from Hollywood and into the real world of late antiquity.
    There is not the slightest sign, in Nag Hammadi any more than in
    the Dead Sea Scrolls, of Jesus being married to Mary and having a
    child by her. The
    “[Gospel of Thomas](Gospel_of_Thomas "Gospel of Thomas")” has one
    saying about Mary (51:19), in which “Jesus” states that “Mary will
    be saved if she makes herself male, because every female who makes
    herself male will become fit for the kingdom of God.” That is
    hardly a ringing endorsement for the sacred feminine. If it’s
    sacred femininity you want, you must look elsewhere, to various
    forms of paganism ancient and modern. These have become enormously
    popular in some strands of
    [New Age](index.php?title=New_Age&action=edit&redlink=1 "New Age (page does not exist)")
    and [postmodern](Postmodernism "Postmodernism") thinking. They have
    found their way into some revisionist versions of western
    Christianity. But they have nothing to do with Nag Hammadi and
    nothing whatever to do with early Christianity.
