Nancy Pearcey
**Nancy Randolph Pearcey** is the Francis A. Schaeffer Scholar at
the World Journalism Institute, where she teaches a worldview
course based on the study guide edition of
[Total Truth: Liberating Christianity from Its Cultural Captivity](http://www.totaltruthbook.com).
In 2005, Total Truth won the ECPA Gold Medallion Award in the
Christianity & Society category, in addition to an Award of Merit
in the Christianity Today book awards.

A former [agnostic](Agnosticism "Agnosticism"), Pearcey studied
violin in Heidelberg, Germany, in the early 1970s and then traveled
to Switzerland to study Christian worldview under
[Francis Schaeffer](Francis_Schaeffer "Francis Schaeffer") at
L’Abri Fellowship. After graduating from Iowa State University with
a Distributed Studies degree (philosophy, German, music), she
earned a master’s degree in Biblical Studies from Covenant
Theological Seminary in St. Louis, then pursued further graduate
work in the history of philosophy at the Institute for Christian
Studies in Toronto (with emphases on ancient and Reformational
philosophy).

Pearcey is currently a senior fellow at the
[Discovery Institute](http://www.discovery.org), where the focus of
her work is on the cultural and philosophical implications of the
evolution controversy. A frequent public lecturer, Pearcey has
spoken to actors and screenwriters in Hollywood; students and
faculty at universities such as Dartmouth, Stanford, USC, and
Princeton; scientists at national labs such as Sandia and Los
Alamos; staffers at Congress and the White House; and various
activist and church groups around the country, including the
Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C. She has appeared on NPR,
and a lecture based on Total Truth was broadcast by C-SPAN.

She began writing in 1977 for the nationally distributed
Bible-Science Newsletter, where for 13 years she wrote pioneering
in-depth monthly articles on issues related to science and
Christian worldview. In 1991 she became the founding editor of
“BreakPoint,” a national daily radio commentary program, and
continued as the program’s executive editor for nearly nine years,
heading up a team of writers. Under her leadership, the program
grew into an influential organ for teaching a Christian
[worldview](Worldview "Worldview") perspective on current events,
with an estimated weekly audience of five million. She was also
policy director and senior fellow of the Wilberforce Forum, and for
five years coauthored a monthly column in
