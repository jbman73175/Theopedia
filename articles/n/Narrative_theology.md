**Narrative theology** was a late 20th century theological
development which supported the idea that the Church's use of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") should focus on a narrative presentation of
the faith, rather than on the development of a
[systematic theology](Systematic_theology "Systematic theology").
The Christian faith is thus also to be interpreted by the Christian
community, and not by outside scholars or
explorers.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
*Narrative theology* is typically done by those known as
[post-liberals](Post-liberalism "Post-liberalism").

Beginning as a reaction to
[theological liberalism](Liberalism "Liberalism"), important
*narrative* thinkers included
[George Lindbeck](George_Lindbeck "George Lindbeck"),
[Hans Frei](Hans_Frei "Hans Frei"),
[Stanley Hauerwas](Stanley_Hauerwas "Stanley Hauerwas"), and
[William Willimon](William_Willimon "William Willimon"). While the
movement still exists in the 21st century, much of its thrust was
absorbed by other movements, such as the so-called
[emerging church movement](Emerging_church "Emerging church"), and
elements of traditional
[evangelicalism](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism").
