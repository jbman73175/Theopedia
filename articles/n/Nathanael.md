**Nathanael** was from the town of Cana in Galilee, not far from
the village of Nazareth where [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") grew up (John
21:2). Another Galilean named
[Philip](Philip_the_apostle "Philip the apostle") met Jesus, then
went to tell Nathanael that Jesus was the one whose coming was
foretold in the Scriptures. Nathanael was skeptical and asked, "Can
anything good come out of Nazareth?" (John 1:46). Despite his
question, Nathanael went to meet Jesus for himself, soon calling
Jesus "the Son of [God](God "God") and King of
[Israel](Israel "Israel")." Nathanael was one of the disciples to
whom Jesus appeared beside the Sea of Galilee after the
resurrection (John
21:2).[[1]](http://www.princeofpeaceonline.org/connect/family/teens/middle_school/bible_tutor/level2/program/start/people/nathan2.htm)
