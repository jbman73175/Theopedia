**Natural theology** is the branch of
[philosophy and theology](Philosophy_and_theology "Philosophy and theology")
which attempts to either
[prove God's existence](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God "Arguments for the existence of God"),
define [God's attributes](Attributes_of_God "Attributes of God"),
or derive correct doctrine based solely from human reason and/or
observations of the natural world. This endevour is distinct from
other theological methods in that it excludes the assistance of
special revelation.
[Thomas Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") is the most
famous classical proponent of natural theology.

Others throughout [church history](Church_history "Church history")
have rejected natural theology. Most in the
[Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") and Reformed tradition reject
natural theology as having no foundational validity because the
doctrine of [Sola Scriptura](Sola_Scriptura "Sola Scriptura")
leaves no source apart from Scripture from which to derive an
accurate understanding of God, man, morality, justice, etc.
Furthermore, it is rejected on the basis that mankind is so
[bound by sin](Total_depravity "Total depravity") that they can
"know" nothing of God except that which is revealed to them.
[Neo-orthodox](Neo-orthodox "Neo-orthodox") theologian
[Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth"), one of the most influential
Protestant theologians of the 20th century, sought to demonstrate
that God can only be known through special
[revelation](Revelation "Revelation"). Both he and
[Paul Tillich](Paul_Tillich "Paul Tillich") debated over this
issue, Tillich arguing that revelation never runs counter to
reason.

Supporters of natural theology, such as
[Paul Tillich](Paul_Tillich "Paul Tillich") and Aquinas (among
others), have argued that the existence of God can be known through
reason. Many "proofs" for the
[existence of God](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God "Arguments for the existence of God")
have been created, however, theologians have often rejected these
proofs on the basis that they do not end up with the Christian God
of the Bible.

## Arguments against Natural Theology

### Proverbs 3:5

*"Trust in the LORD with all your heart And do not lean on your own understanding."*
This passage contrasts trusting the LORD with leaning on one's own
understanding. Many proponents of natural theology have attempted
to establish an understanding of God by beginning with their own
understanding of the world and nature.

### Psalm 147:19,20

*"He declares His words to Jacob, His statutes and His ordinances to Israel. He has not dealt thus with any nation; And as for His ordinances, they have not known them. Praise the LORD!"*
One claim many natural theologians make is that an system of
morality can be reached apart from God's revealed word. These
verses declare that God's ordinances which defined right and wrong
were not declared to any nation other than Israel. God, in other
words, did not reveal himself or his criteria for morality to any
nation save Israel, thus "they [all nations other than Israel] have
not know them."
