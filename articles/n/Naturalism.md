Generally speaking, **Naturalism** is a philosophical system which
holds that everything can be explained by means of natural causes.
Naturalism can be summed up with Carl Sagan's infamous quote that
"The Cosmos is all that is, or ever was, or ever will be."
[[1]](http://www.asa3.org/asa/pscf/1993/pscf3-93mckim.html)
Naturalism denies the existence of the supernatural and is thus
opposed to supernaturalism. It is held by virtually all atheists.
Modern day proponents of naturalism include Richard Carrier, Keith
Parsons, and Michael Martin.

## Criticism

In [C. S. Lewis's](C._S._Lewis "C. S. Lewis") book
*Miracles: A Preliminary Study*, he accuses naturalism as being
self-defeating because it undercuts the basis for rational
thinking. However his argument was disputed in 1948 by the Catholic
philosopher G. E. M. Anscombe. Lewis subsequently revised his
argument in the 1960 version of *Miracles.* Since then, there have
been other individuals who have defended Lewis's argument against
naturalism. Victor Reppert has defended and reformulated Lewis's
argument in his book
*C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea: In Defense of the Argument from Reason*.

[Alvin Plantinga](Alvin_Plantinga "Alvin Plantinga") has also
criticized naturalism in his books *Warrant and Proper Function*
and *Warranted Christian Belief*. He presents what he calls an
evolutionary argument against naturalism. Plantinga argues that the
probability that our cognitive faculties are reliable given
naturalistic evolution is low, and as such we have an defeater for
naturalism.
