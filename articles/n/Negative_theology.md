**Negative theology**, also known as **Apophatic theology**, is a
theological approach that describes [God](God "God") by negation,
speaking of God only in terms of what He is not (apophasis) rather
than presuming to describe what God is.

In negative theology, it is maintained that we can never truly
define God in words. In the end, the student must transcend words
to understand the nature of the Divine. In this sense, negative
theology is not a denial. Rather, it is an assertion that whatever
the Divine may be, when we attempt to capture it in human words, we
will inevitably fall short.

In contrast, making positive statements about the
[nature](Nature "Nature") of God, which occurs in most other forms
of Christian theology, is sometimes called
[cataphatic theology](Cataphatic_theology "Cataphatic theology").

Negative theology played an important role early in the
[history of Christianity](Church_history "Church history"). Three
theologians who emphasized the importance of negative theology to
an orthodox understanding of God, were
[Gregory the Theologian](Gregory_the_Theologian "Gregory the Theologian"),
[John Chrysostom](John_Chrysostom "John Chrysostom"), and
[Basil the Great](Basil_the_Great "Basil the Great"). It was
employed by [John of Damascus](John_of_Damascus "John of Damascus")
when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal "not the
nature, but the things around the nature." It continues to be
prominent in
[Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy") (see
Gregory Palamas) where apophatic statements are crucial to much of
their theology, and is used to balance cataphatic theology.
