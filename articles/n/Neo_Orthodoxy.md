**Neo-Orthodoxy** is best described as "an approach or attitude
that began in a common environment but soon expressed itself in
diverse ways. It began in the crisis associated with the
disillusionment following World War I, with a rejection of
Protestant [scholasticism](Scholasticism "Scholasticism"), and with
a denial of the Protestant [liberal](Liberalism "Liberalism")
movement which had stressed accommodation of Christianity to
Western science and culture, the
[immanence of God](Immanence_of_God "Immanence of God"), and the
progressive improvement of mankind." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

Notable figures associated with this form of theology include
[Emil Brunner](Emil_Brunner "Emil Brunner") (1889-1966) and
[Paul Tillich](Paul_Tillich "Paul Tillich") (1886-1965) whose
theological methods were markedly influenced by the writings of
Danish philosopher
[Soren Kierkegaard](Soren_Kierkegaard "Soren Kierkegaard")
(1813-1855) who is regarded as the father of
[existentialism](Existentialism "Existentialism"). Some scholars
have added [Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth") (1886-1968) to the
list, but this has been recently disputed. ^[[2]](#note-1)^

Neo-Orthodoxy, in fact, is known for its existential element which
stresses the subjective experience of the individual and regards
propositional [truth](Truth "Truth") as either irrelevant or
indeterminate. According to Neo-Orthodoxy, existential truth is a
truth that transforms the individual in his concrete here and now.
Propositional truth, on the other hand, may increase one's
information but leaves man essentially unchanged. According to the
Neo-Orthodox, as long as we conceive of
[the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall") as an historical event, we fail to
think existentially. They typically see the Fall as something we
all commit.

The [Bible](Bible "Bible") is said to contain within it an inspired
witness, but it is a mistake to directly identify Scripture as the
Word of God; [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"), the person, is the Word of
God. The Bible can become the Word of God only when God chooses to
*use* it to reveal himself. Therefore, the actual text and words of
Scripture are not identified as the Word of God. Rather, it is an
instrument to communicate and witness to the true Word, Jesus.
Neo-Orthodoxy accepts
[higher criticism](Biblical_criticism "Biblical criticism") of the
Scriptures but believes [exegesis](Exegesis "Exegesis") must move
beyond mere historical inquiries.

## American Neo-orthodoxy

Neo-orthodoxy is an umbrella term for profoundly different
theologies. It was embraced in the U.S. by thousands of pastors and
theologians who generally received their theology from Brunner and
Niebuhr rather than from Barth. American neo-orthodoxy in the 1940s
and 1950s typically meant a compound of
[Emil Brunner](Emil_Brunner "Emil Brunner")’s dogmatics,
[Reinhold Niebuhr](Reinhold_Niebuhr "Reinhold Niebuhr")’s
theological ethics, and the Scripture scholarship of the biblical
theology movement. This movement, a reaction to the perceived
sterility of earlier, purely analytic studies, emphasized the
unifying themes of Scripture and stressed the revelatory acts of
God in history as described in the Bible. ^[[3]](#note-2)^

## The end of the movement?

The Neo-orthodox movement was stunningly successful in reorienting
the field of modern theology. The biblical language of
[sin](Sin "Sin"),
[transcendence](Transcendence_of_God "Transcendence of God") and
the Word of God resumed a prominent place in theological
discourse.

But in a remarkably brief period of time, the house of
neo-orthodoxy crashed. During the 1960s, the theological giants of
neo-orthodoxy passed away, James Barr’s claims about the uniqueness
of biblical semantics dismantled biblical theology, and Langdon
Gilkey exposed the incoherence of neo-orthodox God-language. Gilkey
showed that for all of its condemnations of theological liberalism,
neo-orthodoxy construed the meaning of the scriptural "mighty acts
of God" in essentially liberal terms. Gilkey later called attention
to a secularizing trend in theology -- he called it "death-of-God
theology" which was led by former Barthians such as William
Hamilton and Paul van Buren. Shortly after that, the first currents
of liberation theology emerged in Latin America and the U.S.,
making neo-orthodoxy seem stuffy, provincial and oppressive.

## A revival of Neo-orthodoxy?

[Postmodernism](Postmodernism "Postmodernism") has proven to be
remarkably congenial to neo-orthodoxy as a new generation of
theologically conservative clergy and theologians works to find
ways to affirm the authority and truth of scripture without viewing
it as historically accurate or literally true in all cases.
[Post-liberal](Post-liberal "Post-liberal") scholars such as
[George Lindbeck](George_Lindbeck "George Lindbeck") and
[Charles Campbell](index.php?title=Charles_Campbell&action=edit&redlink=1 "Charles Campbell (page does not exist)")
are producing new scholarship that, in many ways, is a revival of
neo-orthodox understandings of [Scripture](Scripture "Scripture")
and the [Church](Church "Church").

## Criticism

### Scripture

While Neo-Orthodoxy claims to hold many of the orthodox
[doctrines](Doctrine "Doctrine") of the faith, it radically departs
in a critical area - the
[authority](Authority_of_the_Bible "Authority of the Bible") and
[inspiration](Inspiration_of_the_Bible "Inspiration of the Bible")
of the Scriptures. Scripture is no longer a reliable guide unless
God chooses to use it in a persons life. Hence, it is difficult to
find any doctrinal consistency among Neo-Orthodox theologians, even
with regard to critical things such as the nature of the
[atonement](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ").

    that the term "neo-orthodox" is inappropriate for Barth and that
    such a label is actually the result of Anglo-American neo-orthodox
    readings of him. See his work,
