The **Neo-Evangelical** movement was a response among orthodox
evangelical [Protestants](Protestantism "Protestantism") to the
separatism of [fundamentalist](Fundamentalism "Fundamentalism")
Christianity beginning in the 1930s.

## History

The term was coined by
[Harold Ockenga](Harold_Ockenga "Harold Ockenga") in 1947, to
identify a distinct movement within the broader evangelical
fundamentalist Christianity of that day.

What has been termed a split within the fundamentalist movement,
came about as they disagreed among themselves about how
Bible-believing Christians ought to respond to an unbelieving
world. The *neo-evangelicals* urged that fundamentalists must
engage the culture directly and constructively ^[1](#Footnotes)^,
and they began to express embarrassment about being known to the
world as *fundamentalists*. As
[Kenneth Kantzer](Kenneth_Kantzer "Kenneth Kantzer") put it in
those days, the name *fundamentalist* had become “an embarrassment
instead of a badge of honor. ^[2](#Footnotes)^

The Fundamentalist opponents of these *new evangelicals*, on the
other hand, saw themselves as more willing to publically confront
Church apostasy and personal immorality than neo-evangelicals; and
they believed this to have its proper and constructive place. In
short, they saw the neo-evangelicals as often being too concerned
about social acceptance and intellectual respectability, and being
too accommodating to a perverse generation that needed correction.
In addition, they saw the efforts of
[Billy Graham](Billy_Graham "Billy Graham"), who worked with more
liberal mainline denominations (and especially with Roman
Catholicism), as a mistake and they tended to support their own
evangelists. [[1]](http://mb-soft.com/believe/text/fundamen.htm)

## Engagement without accommodation

Neo-evangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal
parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage
as Evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of the world.
At the same time they criticized their fellow Fundamentalists, for
their separatism, and their rejection of the
[Social gospel](index.php?title=Social_gospel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Social gospel (page does not exist)")
as it had been developed by Protestant activists of the previous
century. They charged the modernists with having lost their
identity as Evangelicals, and attacked the Fundamentalists as
having lost the Christ-like heart of Evangelicalism. They argued
that the Gospel needed to be reasserted to distinguish it from the
innovations of the liberals and the fundamentalists.

As part of this renewal of Evangelicalism, the *new evangelicals*
sought to engage the modern world and the liberal Christians in a
positive way, remaining separate from worldliness but not from the
world — a middle way, between modernism and the separating variety
of fundamentalism. They sought allies in denominational churches
and liturgical traditions, disregarding views of eschatology and
other "non-essentials", and joined also with trinitarian varieties
of [Pentecostalism](Pentecostalism "Pentecostalism"). They believed
that in doing so, they were simply re-acquainting Protestantism
with its own recent tradition. The movement's aim at the outset was
to reclaim the Evangelical heritage in their respective churches,
not to begin something new; and for this reason, following their
separation from Fundamentalists, the same movement has been better
known as merely, "Evangelicalism". By the end of the 20th century,
this was the most influential development in American Protestant
Christianity.

These "evangelicals" used the *fundamentalist* label to describe
the group that advocated separation and confrontation, as the
proper response to an unbelieving culture. The self-identified
fundamentalists also cooperated in separating their opponents from
the *fundamentalist* name, by increasingly seeking to distinguish
themselves from the more open group, whom they often characterized
derogatorily, by Ockenga's term, *Neo-evangelical*.

## Today

The term *neo-evangelicalism* no longer has any reliable meaning
except for historical purposes. It is still self-descriptive of the
movement to which it used to apply, to distinguish the parties in
the developing fundamentalist split prior to the 1950s.

The term is now used almost exclusively by conservative critics, to
distinguish their idea of Evangelicalism from this movement. They
claim that a loss of Biblical authority was evident early, which
would later bear fruit in more and more accommodation: which they
perceive to have happened wherever neoevangelicals deny, or too
severely qualify their belief in, the doctrine of biblical
inerrancy [[2]](http://withchrist.org/mjs/neoevan2.htm). Some
liberal writers, speaking critically, might refer to
*neo-evangelicalism* or *neo-fundamentalism*, with comparably
variable meanings.

The neo-evangelicals are largely credited with the relative,
apparent success of the fundamentalist aim in the English-speaking
world — now the name *Evangelical* has been captured for primary
reference to those who at a minimum affirm the fundamental
Christian beliefs — but, even so, the *Fundamentalist* name does
not apply to the Evangelical movement because of the
neo-evangelical division.
