**Neonomianism** in Christian [theology](Theology "Theology"),
literally meaning "new law," is the [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine")
that the [Gospel](Gospel "Gospel") presents a new law, the
requirements of which are [faith](Faith "Faith") and
[repentance](Repentance "Repentance"). This view is most often
associated with the theology of
[Richard Baxter](Richard_Baxter "Richard Baxter") (1615-1691).

Opponents believe neonomianism changes the free Gospel offer into
an understanding of salvation by works; i.e., humanity is not saved
by Christ but by their obedience to Christ through their faith and
repentance.
