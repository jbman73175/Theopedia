Novum Testamentum Graece
**Nestle-Aland** is a common reference to a modern
[Greek](Greek "Greek") language version of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), the
*Novum Testamentum Graece*, named after the scholars who led the
critical editing work. The text, edited by the
*Institut f√ºr neutestamentliche Textforschung* at the University of
Munster (Germany) is currently in its 27th edition, abbreviated
NA27. The NA27 is used as the basis of most contemporary New
Testament translations, as well as being the standard for academic
work in New Testament studies. It should be noted that the Greek
text of the 27th edition is virtually identical to the 4th edition
of the United Bible Societies Greek New Testament (abbreviated
UBS4).

The Nestle-Aland Greek text is based on what biblical textual
scholars refer to as the "critical text". The critical text is an
eclectic text compiled by a committee that examines existing
(extant) manuscripts in order to weigh and select which reading is
thought closest to the lost original autographs. A number of
factors are used to help determine probable readings, such as the
date of a given manuscript, the geographical distribution of a
particular reading, and possibly accidental or intentional
corruptions. Extensive footnotes (called the critical apparatus)
identify a large number of textual variants, or differences found
in specific manuscripts, to aid in study and evaluation.

## Background

A first edition published by Eberhard Nestle in 1898 combined the
readings of the editions of Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort, and
Weymouth. In 1901, he replaced Weymouth with Bernhard Weiss's text.
In later edition, Nestle began noting the attestation of certain
important manuscripts in his footnote apparatus.

Eberhard's son Erwin Nestle took over after his father's death and
issued the 13th edition in 1927. This edition introduced a separate
critical apparatus and began to abandon the majority reading
principle.

Kurt Aland became the associate editor of the 21st edition in 1952.
At Erwin Nestle's request, he reviewed and expanded the critical
apparatus, adding many more manuscripts. This eventually led to the
25th edition of 1963. The great manuscript discoveries of the 20th
century had also made a revision of the text necessary and, with
Nestle's permission, Aland set out to revise the text of
*Novum Testamentum Graece*. Aland submitted his work on NA to the
editorial committee of the United Bible Societies Greek New
Testament (of which he was also a member) and it became the basic
text of their third edition (UBS3) in 1975, four years before it
was published as the 26th edition of Nestle-Aland.

The current edition of Nestle-Aland reproduces the text of NA26
(the same text used in UBS3 and UBS4). The 27th edition presents a
heavily revised critical apparatus and a rewritten introduction.
