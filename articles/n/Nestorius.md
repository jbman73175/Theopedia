**Nestorius** (c.386 â€“ c.451) was Patriarch of Constantinople from
10 April 428 to 22 June 431. He received his clerical training as a
pupil of Theodore of Mopsuestia in Antioch and gained a reputation
for his sermons that led to his enthronement by Theodosius II as
Patriarch following the death of Sisinius I in 428 A.D.

Nestorius is considered to be the originator of the Christological
heresy known as [Nestorianism](Nestorianism "Nestorianism"), which
emerged when he began preaching against the new title Theotokos or
Mother of God, beginning to be used of the Virgin Mary. His
immediate antagonist was
[Cyril, bishop of Alexandria](Cyril_of_Alexandria "Cyril of Alexandria").
Although Nestorius did deny the
[Virgin birth of Jesus](Virgin_birth_of_Jesus "Virgin birth of Jesus"),
he did not in fact maintain the heresy which bears his name.
