The **New American Standard Bible (NASB)** is an English
translation of the [Bible](Bible "Bible") published by the Lockman
Foundation in 1971 and most recently revised in 1995. The NASB is
widely regarded as the most literal translation available today.

## Translation Philosophy

According to the NASB's preface, the translators had a "Fourfold
Aim" in this work:

1.  These publications shall be true to the original Hebrew,
    [Aramaic](Aramaic "Aramaic"), and [Greek](Greek "Greek").
2.  They shall be grammatically correct.
3.  They shall be understandable.
4.  They shall give the Lord [Jesus Christ](Jesus "Jesus") His
    proper place, the place which the Word gives Him; therefore, no
    work will ever be personalized.

Seeing the need for a literal, modern translation of the English
Bible, the translators sought to produce a comtemporary English
Bible while maintaining a word-for-word translation style. In cases
where word-for-word literalness was determined to be unacceptable
for modern readers, changes were made in the direction of more
current idioms. In such instances, the more literal renderings were
indicated in footnotes.

The greatest perceived strength of the NASB is its reliability and
fidelity to the original languages without theological
interpretation. Its corresponding weakness is that its readability
and literary style sometimes prove confusing to the average reader.
In addition, its printing of verses as individual units instead of
paragraphs makes the text appear fragmented (though more recent
editions are available in paragraph format). The NASB, along with
other literal translations, also allows for ambiguities in the
text's meaning. Though some perceive this as a weakness in the
translation, it is actually a function of the aforementioned lack
of theological interpretation.

### Updated NASB (1995)

In 1995, the Lockman Foundation published a revised edition of the
NASB text as the *NASB Updated Edition* (or more often, the
*Updated NASB* or *NASB95*). Since then, it has become known simply
as the "NASB" and has supplanted the 1971 text in current
printings.

One of the major differences between the updated version and the
original NASB is the removal of the archaic 2nd person pronouns
(thee, thy, thou, etc) which had only been used when speakers and
writers were addressing [God](God "God"). Another major difference
was the recasting of the many sentences in the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") which begin with
"And", which is good Hebrew style, but not acceptable in
contemporary English.

In removing or replacing literal renderings of antiquated phrases
and words, the current edition is slightly less literal than the
original. The NASB remains, however, the most literal version of
the English Bible commonly used in churches today.

## History and Textual Basis

As its name implies, the NASB is a revision of the
[American Standard Version](American_Standard_Version "American Standard Version")
of 1901. This translation was begun as an alternative to the
then-popular
[Revised Standard Version](Revised_Standard_Version "Revised Standard Version")
(1952 edition), which was perceived as too liberal in its
translation style. Using the ASV as its English basis, the NASB's
translators went back to established Hebrew,
[Aramaic](Aramaic "Aramaic"), and [Greek](Greek "Greek") texts and
revised the ASV as literally as possible, deliberately interpreting
the [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") from a
[Christian](Christian "Christian") standpoint, in harmony with the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament").

The Hebrew text used for this translation was the third edition of
Rudolf Kittel's
*[Biblia Hebraica](Masoretic_text "Masoretic text")*, as well as
the [Dead Sea Scrolls](Dead_Sea_Scrolls "Dead Sea Scrolls"). The
*[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia](Masoretic_text "Masoretic text")*
was consulted for the 1995 revision. For Greek, Eberhard Nestle's
*Novum Testamentum Graece* 23rd edition was used in the 1971
original, and the [Nestle-Aland](Nestle-Aland "Nestle-Aland") 26th
edition in the 1995 revision.
