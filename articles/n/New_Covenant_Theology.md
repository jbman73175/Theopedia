**New Covenant Theology** is a technical term referring to a
theological view of redemptive history primarily found in
[Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") circles and contrasted with
[Covenant theology](Covenant_theology "Covenant theology") and
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism"). It has
been assumed that one has only two primary options in understanding
the structure of the Bible in evangelical Christianity -- Covenant
Theology (coming out of the Reformation) or Dispensationalism.
However, proponents see what has come to be called New Covenant
Theology as middle ground with a biblical basis of understanding.

Proponents maintain that the primary thrust of New Covenant
Theology is the recognition of a promise-fulfillment understanding
of Scripture. They suggest that whereas “Dispensationalism cannot
get Israel and the church together in any sense whatsoever, and
Covenant Theology cannot get them apart” (Reisinger, 19), New
Covenant Theology finds the realization of all that the Old
Covenant typified in the New Testament church (Covenant Theology,
in contrast, merely levels the playing field and identifies them
for all intents and purposes). The Mosaic economy is viewed as a
temporal, conditional covenant that has been forever replaced by
the glory of the New Covenant (2 Corinthians 3).

## History

Despite its seemingly recent representation in modern theological
discussions, today's proponents of New Covenant Theology (NCT) see
roots extending back to the
post-[Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation")
theological developments. Baptist history, especially the
[Reformed](Reformed_Baptist "Reformed Baptist") variety, is rooted
in the basic tenets of New Covenant Theology. Much of its primary
teaching is reflected in the influential
[First London Baptist Confession](First_London_Baptist_Confession "First London Baptist Confession")
of Faith, especially in its 1646 edition (which is held by many New
Covenant Theology churches today). However, in the historical
whirlwind of this period, [Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism")
(Particular) Baptists felt a need to show close alignment with
their Reformed
brethren^[***[citations\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
in the Congregationalist and Presbyterian churches in order to
avoid persecution and thus adopted the
[Second London Confession](London_Baptist_Confession_of_1689 "London Baptist Confession of 1689")
in 1689, a virtual restatement of the famous
[Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")
with slight modifications, especially, of course, in the area of
baptism. This move left an indelible mark of "covenant theology" in
the Particular Baptists from that point forward.

The last twenty-five years have seen a great resurgence of Reformed
theology in Baptist circles. As a result, many within this camp
have sought to develop a more clarified system of the covenants
that relate back to older thought. Leaders of this movement include
such theologians as John Reisinger, Jon Zens, Peter Ditzel, Fred
Zaspel, Tom Wells, Gary Long, Geoff Volker and Steve Lehrer. The
writings of [Douglas Moo](Douglas_Moo "Douglas Moo"),
[Tom Schreiner](Tom_Schreiner "Tom Schreiner"), and
[D.A. Carson](D.A._Carson "D.A. Carson") on the relation of the
Christian to the law reveal their sympathies with NCT. However they
have not wanted themselves to be so
labeled.^[***[citations\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
[John Piper](John_Piper "John Piper") also has many points of
contact with this movement, but an article at Desiring God
carefully distinguishes his position from the Covenant, New
Covenant and Dispensational theological systems.

## Contrasted with Covenant Theology

New Covenant Theology, while having some similarities to
[Progressive Dispensationalism](Progressive_Dispensationalism "Progressive Dispensationalism")
has more in common with classic
[Covenant Theology](Covenant_Theology "Covenant Theology"), in
particular in how Israel and the Church are viewed. Both sides do
not see an absolute distinction between the Old Testament people of
God (Israel) and the Church as
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") does.
They also are similar in their
[soteriology](Soteriology "Soteriology") and
[eschatology](Eschatology "Eschatology") (some see literal
millennium and some don't, but neither would hold to a future
millennium for the reinstatement of Israel as in
dispensationalism).

There are points of contention however. New Covenant Theology has
more in common with
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") than
[Covenant Theology](Covenant_Theology "Covenant Theology") in terms
of the relation of the Mosaic Law to the
[New Covenant](New_Covenant "New Covenant") economy.

### Agreement

-   The Church has become “spiritual Israel.”
-   Gentiles are heirs to the
    [Abrahamic Covenant](Abrahamic_Covenant "Abrahamic Covenant") (Gal
    3:8–9; Eph 2:11ff; Rom 4:1–13; Rev 5:9).
-   Acknowledges the
    [redemptive-historical](index.php?title=Redemptive-historical&action=edit&redlink=1 "Redemptive-historical (page does not exist)")
    hermeneutic.
-   [Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") in soteriology.
-   The Old Testament does have prophecies of the Church age (Jer
    31:31–34; cf. Heb 8).
-   God’s main purpose in history is Christ and His Church (elect
    throughout all ages).
-   Everyone ever saved is saved by grace alone, through faith
    alone, in Christ alone (Rom 4).
-   Christ offered a spiritual kingdom to ethnic Israel but was
    rejected. Spiritual Israel, however, accepted and continues to
    accept the kingdom.
-   [Inaugurated eschatology](Inaugurated_eschatology "Inaugurated eschatology").

### Disagreement

-   The Church started at Pentecost, and there is therefore no
    “Church” as such in the Old Testament/Covenant.
-   Rejects the three “theological covenants” often espoused (with
    some variation) in Covenant Theology, viz. the covenants of
    redemption, works, grace.
-   Sees the Mosaic Law as only a means of blessing in Canaan.
-   The Mosaic Law is fulfilled with the advent of Christ and the
    New Covenant; New Covenant believers are under the Law of Christ (1
    Cor 9:21).
-   All hold to [credobaptism](Credobaptism "Credobaptism").
-   The Holy Spirit worked differently in the Old Covenant than in
    the New (the Spirit now indwells believers).

## Law/Gospel

The biggest difference between classical Covenant Theology and New
Covenant Theology is how they view the Mosaic Law. Covenant
Theology sees the Mosaic Law as divided into civil, ceremonial, and
moral, with only the moral law remaining in effect. New Covenant
Theology sees the New Testament writers as referring to the Mosaic
Law in its totality (in other words all 613 laws, not only the Ten
Commandments). Therefore, when Paul says that "we are no longer
under a tutor" (Gal 3:25) he is saying that the Mosaic Law
*en toto* has passed away.

There is still a Law in the New Testament however. Paul says that
he is "under the law of Christ" (1 Cor 9:21), and he is therefore
still responsible to Law. The eternal, unchanging moral law is
expressed in both the New and Old Law, but the Old Law doesn't
itself carry over. The
[Law of Christ](index.php?title=Law_of_Christ&action=edit&redlink=1 "Law of Christ (page does not exist)")
are the moral commands given by the writers of the New Testament
(Jesus and his apostles). As Moses went to a mountain to get the
Law, so Christ went up into a mountain to give the new Law (Mat
5-7; cf. 2 Cor 3).

## Criticisms

Detractors, like Reformed Baptist Sam Waldron, see New Covenant
Theology deviating from the traditional Reformed hermeneutic of the
law which argues that whatever is not abolished in Christ
continues. For example, in Waldron's assessment "New Covenant
Theology says that the entire Law of Moses has passed away and only
remains in so far as it passes through the hands of Christ.
According to Wells and Zaspel, prior to Christ’s actual teaching in
the New Testament one simply cannot be sure what He will do with
the law of the Old Testament. Thus, none of the Law of Moses or
even the Ten Commandments remain binding for us unless Christ hands
it on to us in the New Testament."
