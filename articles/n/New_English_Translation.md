[The Making of the NET Bible](http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=10)

"The NET Bible (New English Translation) is a completely new
translation of the [Bible](Bible "Bible"), not a revision or an
update of a previous English version. It is being completed by more
than twenty biblical scholars who are working directly from the
best currently available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. The
translation project originally started as an attempt to provide an
electronic version of a modern translation for electronic
distribution over the Internet and on CD-Rom. Anyone anywhere in
the world with an Internet connection will be able to use and print
out the NET Bible without cost for personal study. In addition,
anyone who wants to share the Bible with others can print unlimited
copies and give them away free to others."
