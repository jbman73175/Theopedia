## Translation

The New Testament was first published in 1973 and the complete
Bible was published in 1978 and revised in 1984. The translation
work was done under the auspices of the International Bible Society
and Zondervan Publishing House.

The translation took more than ten years and involved 100 scholars
from the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand,
and South Africa. The range of theologians includes over 20
different Protestant denominations such as Anglican, Assemblies of
God, [Baptist](Baptists "Baptists"), Christian Reformed, Lutheran,
Mennonite, [Methodists](Methodism "Methodism"), Presbyterian, and
many more. Most of these translators hold--or held at that time--to
[Evangelicalism](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism").

There has been some criticism of the NIV from conservative
Protestants who objected to the non-literal method of the
translation. The moderate use of the so-called
*dynamic equivalence* method of translation in the version involved
a trade-off in which accuracy was sometimes sacrificed for the sake
of readability. As Daniel Wallace of Dallas Theological Seminary
observed, "Readability seems to have been a higher priority than
anything else" in the making of the NIV. The erosion of accuracy
was not as severe as in many modern versions which used this method
of translation without restraint (e.g. the Good News Bible and the
New Living Translation) but it did present problems for preachers
and teachers who were trying to use the NIV while focusing on
verbal details of the text. For instance, conservative teachers
often like to point out that the word hilasterion (literally
"propitiation") in the New Testament implies a certain doctrine of
the atonement (God who is angry with sin must be made propitious
toward us by the blood of Christ), but in the NIV this technical
term was rendered rather loosely as "atoning sacrifice." And aside
from such inconveniences to theological exposition, the idiomatic
style seemed to make the sacred text less impressive and less
memorable than most conservatives would prefer. As Professor
Wallace said, "It is so readable that it has no memorable
expressions, nothing that lingers in the mind. This is a serious
problem for the NIV that is not always acknowledged."

## Circulation

The translation has become the most popular modern English
translation of the Bible, having sold 150 million copies worldwide.
It is especially popular among American Evangelicals. It is
considered by many Christians a good, modern supplement to more
historic bible translations like the
[King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version").
