The **New Jerusalem Bible** (NJB) is an approved Roman Catholic
translation of the Bible, published in 1985 and edited by The
Reverend Henry Wansbrough. It is a revision of the Jerusalem Bible
(1966) which in turn was an English translation of the French
*Bible de Jérusalem* (1961) prepared by the faculty of the
Dominican Biblical School in Jerusalem. The French Bible was
revised in 1973 and so eventually led to a corresponding revision
of the English version.

The New Jerusalem Bible has become the most widely used Roman
Catholic Bible outside of the United States. American Catholics
prefer the New American Bible published by the US Conference of
Catholic Bishops.^[[1]](#note-0)^
