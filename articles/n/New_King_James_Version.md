The **New King James Version** (NKJV) is a modern
[Bible](Bible "Bible") translation, published by Thomas Nelson,
Inc. The Anglicized edition was originally known as the
**Revised Authorised Version**, but the NKJV title is now used
universally. The NKJV New Testament was printed in 1979 and the
complete Bible in 1982. The aim of its translators was to update
the vocabulary and grammar of the
[King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version"),
while preserving the classic style and beauty of the 1611 version.
Although it uses substantially the same Hebrew and Greek texts as
the original KJV, it indicates where other manuscripts differ.

The New King James was originally going to translate the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") using the Majority
Text. However, they reconsidered because it was to be a revision of
a historical document, the King James Version. In the end they
decided not to make any alterations on the basis of the Greek
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") texts, but adhere to
the readings presumed to underlie the King James Version - the
Textus Receptus (Received Text).The revisers have also sought to
follow the principles of translation used in the original King
James Version, which the NKJV revisers call "complete equivalence"
in contrast to "dynamic equivalence."

Many churches and evangelical groups have embraced the NKJV as an
acceptable compromise between the original KJV and a Bible with
more contemporary wording.
