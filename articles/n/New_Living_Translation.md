The **New Living Translation** was first published by Tyndale House
in 1996, underwent a 2nd edition in 2004, sometimes noted as NLTse,
and was most recently revised in 2007 with minor textual and
footnote changes. It's most recent offering is the NLT Study Bible
in 2008. While originally intended as a revision to the Living
Bible, the NLT essentially evolved into a new English translation.
Like most modern translations of the Bible, the NLT textual basis
is the [Masoretic Hebrew Text](Masoretic_text "Masoretic text") of
the OT (Biblia Hebraica) and the
[critical Greek NT Text](New_Testament_Textual_Criticism "New Testament Textual Criticism")
(NA-27 and UBS4).

The NLT translation philosophy may be generally viewed as one of
"dynamic equivalence," similar to the NIV, rathe than a more
literal word-for-word translation. The result is self-described as
midway between the most literal translations (such as the NASB) and
a paraphrase (such as The Message).^[[1]](#note-0)^ The NLT admits
to being less literal than the [NIV](NIV "NIV"), which in turn is
less literal than the [ESV](ESV "ESV"), which in turn is less
literal than the [NASB](NASB "NASB").

## Critique

[Craig Blomberg](Craig_Blomberg "Craig Blomberg") of Denver
Seminary, who was the principal translator for the NLT's Gospel
according to Matthew, has explicitly stated that this version is
not suitable as a regular Bible for adults. Responding to criticism
of the NLT, Blomberg explained that the version is for "kids or
very poor adult readers," and he suggested that readers of the NLT
should move on to a more accurate version when they are
able:^[[2]](#note-1)^

"I relished the chance to work on the NLT (New Living Translation)
team to convert the LBP into a truly dynamic-equivalent
translation, but I never recommend it to anyone except to
supplement the reading of a more literal translation to generate
freshness and new insights, unless they are kids or very poor adult
readers. My sixteen- and twelve-year old daughters have been weaned
on the NLT and have loved it, but both already on their own are now
frequently turning to the NIV."^[[3]](#note-2)^
