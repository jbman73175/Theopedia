aliases: [NPP,New Perspectivism]
---
The **New Perspective on Paul**, also called **New Perspectivism**
(hereafter NPP) is a system of thought in New Testament scholarship
that seeks to reinterpret the Apostle [Paul](Paul "Paul") and his
letters. In brief, the NPP is a reaction to the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation") perspective on Paul (i.e.
the traditional interpretation of him).

The Reformation perspective understands Paul to be arguing against
a [legalistic](Legalism "Legalism") Jewish culture that seeks to
earn their [salvation](Salvation "Salvation") through works.
However, supporters of the NPP argue that Paul has been misread.
They contend he was actually combating Jews who were boasting
because they were God's people, the "elect" or the "chosen ones."
Their "works," so to speak, were done to *show* they were God's
covenant people and not to earn their salvation. According to the
NPP, the result is a Judaism that affirmed
[sola gratia](Sola_gratia "Sola gratia") (grace alone). Presently,
effects of the NPP are primarily seen in the academic world of New
Testament scholars, particularly those who focus their attention on
[Pauline studies](Pauline_studies "Pauline studies") and the study
of first century Judaism. However, ramifications of the NPP
directly affect the [Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") doctrine
of [Justification](Justification "Justification") by Faith
([Sola Fide](Sola_Fide "Sola Fide")).

## Background

Varying authors since the early 1900's have brought up the charge
that Paul was misread by those in the tradition of
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") and other Protestant
[Reformers](Reformation "Reformation"). Yet, it wasn't until E.P.
Sanders' 1977 book, *Paul and Palestinian Judaism*, that scholars
began to pay much attention to the issue. In his book Sanders
argues that the Judaism of Paul's day has been wrongly criticized
as a religion of "works-salvation" by those in the Protestant
tradition. He set out "to destroy the view of Rabbinic Judaism
which is still prevelant in much, perhaps most, New Testament
scholarship" (*Paul and Palestinian Judaism*, xii.). Its adherents
call for a rethinking of Paul and a greater understanding of him in
light of what the NPP claims are the *true beliefs* of first
century Judaism. The more popular scholars associated with the NPP
are [E.P. Sanders](E.P._Sanders "E.P. Sanders"),
[James Dunn](James_Dunn "James Dunn"), and
[N.T. Wright](N.T._Wright "N.T. Wright"). Dunn was the first to
coin the term "The New Perspective" in a 1983 Manson Memorial
Lecture, *The New Perspective on Paul and the Law*.

## Central beliefs to the NPP

Although not every NPP scholar agrees on every point, the following
may serve as a general outline of core beliefs that remain
fundamental to the NPP claim(s).

### Grace in first-century Judaism

A fundamental premise in the NPP is that Judaism was actually a
religion of grace. Sander's puts it clearly:

"On the point at which many have found the decisive contrast
between Paul and Judaism - grace and works - Paul is in agreement
with Palestinian Judaism...
*Salvation is by grace but judgment is according to works'*...God
*saves* by grace, but... *within* the framework established by
grace he rewards good deeds and punishes transgression."
(*Paul and Palestinian Judaism*, p. 543)
N.T. Wright adds that, "we have misjudged early Judaism, especially
Pharisaism, if we have thought of it as an early version of
[Pelagianism](Pelagianism "Pelagianism")," (Wright,
*What Saint Paul Really Said*, p. 32). However,
[Stephen Westerholm](Stephen_Westerholm "Stephen Westerholm") adds
caution to such a quickly drawn conclusion:

"While one may enthusiastically endorse the 'new perspective'
dictum that first-century Judaism was a religion of grace and
acknowledge that it represents an important corrective of earlier
caricatures, it is hardly pedantic to point out that more precision
is needed before such a statement can illuminate a discussion of
the 'Lutheran' Paul. [Pelagius](Pelagius "Pelagius") and
[Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") - to take but the most obvious
examples - *both* believed in human dependence on divine grace, but
they construed that dependence very differently" (Westerholm,
*Perspectives Old and New on Paul*, pp. 261-262).
Thus, as Westerholm points out, although first century Judaism may
have believed in grace, it becomes even more important to establish
*why* they believed in grace and *how* this effected their view of
salvation. Those from the NPP seem quick to jump to the conclusion
that first-century Judaism was in agreement with the *same*
understanding of grace found within the NT and
[Paul's theology](Pauline_theology "Pauline theology"). Again, as
Westerholm notes above, this "grace" can be understood very
differently.

### Pattern of religion: Covenantal Nomism

[E.P. Sanders](E.P._Sanders "E.P. Sanders") is known for coining
the term "covenantal nomism." This term is essential to the NPP
view, as Sanders argues that this is the "pattern of religion"
found in Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism. The term, as defined
by Sanders, means:

"Briefly put, covenantal nomism is the view that one's place in
God's plan is established on the basis of the covenant and that the
covenant requires as the proper response of man his obedience to
its commandments, while providing means of atonement for
transgression." (E.P. Sanders, *Paul and Palestinian Judaism*, p.
75)
The understanding among first-century Palestinian Jews of the
structure and pattern of the law as functioning in redemptive
history is important because, as argues by both sides of the
debate, it has vast implications for one's interpretation of how
Paul interacted with his fellow Jews. If covenantal nomism was
operating as the primary category under which Jews understood the
Law, then when Jews spoke of obeying commandments, or when they
required strict obedience of themselves and fellow Jews, it was
because they were "keeping the [covenant](Covenant "Covenant"),"
rather than out of [legalism](Legalism "Legalism").

Sanders says that, "one's place in God's plan is established on the
basis of the covenant." Therefore, as long as a Jew kept their
covenant with God, he remained part of God's people. How does one
keep the covenant? Sander's tells us "the covenant requires as the
proper response of man his obedience to its commandments." All of
Judaism's talk about "obedience" is thus in the context of
"covenantal nomism" and *not* legalism. As a result, Judaism is
then not concerned with "how to have a right relationship with God"
but with "how to remain his covenant people." This has sometimes
been compared to the issue of "keeping" or "losing one's
salvation."

### The pre-Christian Saul

Proponents of New Perspectivism usually argue that Paul, before
[conversion](Conversion "Conversion"), was more of a zealout for
his nation (Israel) and their special place in God's plan than a
devout Jew who was trying to earn his salvation. This is important,
because if true, this means that Paul was not fighting legalism and
that much Protestant Pauline scholarship following upon Luther has
been wrong.

Advocates of the NPP say that it was not their works that helped
them *attain* salvation, but it was their "nationalistic boundary
markers" (i.e. circumcision, food laws, sabbath, etc.) that
*kept them within* the people of God. Thus, the works, along with
the boundary markers were used to keep themselves within the
boundary of God's people. Paul was not fighting legalism, but was
instead fighting the works and national pride that separated the
Jews from the Gentiles. This is the background that Paul was
exposed to prior to his conversion. In essence, after Paul's
conversion he *was* changed, but he was still a Jew. Everything he
knew as "Saul," the Pharisee, did not just go away. It was
radically changed due to his encounter with Jesus.

### What Paul finds wrong with Judaism

Supporters of the NPP vary in what they believe Paul found wrong
with Judaism. [Sanders](E.P._Sanders "E.P. Sanders") writes in his
book, *Paul and Palestinian Judaism* (1977),

Our analysis of Rabbinic and other Palestinian Jewish literature
did not reveal the kind of religion best characterized as
legalistic works-righteousness. But more important for the present
point is the observation that in any case that charge is not the
heart of Paul's critique... Doing the law, in short, is wrong only
because it is not faith. In itself obedience to the law is a good
thing... and is faulted only when it seems to threaten
exclusiveness of salvation by faith in Christ. (p. 550)
Sanders later sums it up that "this is what Paul finds wrong in
Judaism: it is not Christianity," (p. 552). Others, like
[N.T. Wright](N.T._Wright "N.T. Wright"), believe that "national
righteousness" is the problem. He says that,

If we ask how it is that Israel has missed her vocation, Paul's
answer is that she is guilty not of "legalism" or
"works-righteousness" but of what I call "national righteousness,"
the belief that fleshly Jewish decent guarantees membership of
God's true covenant people,"
(*The Paul of History and the Apostle of Faith*, p. 65).
[Dunn](James_Dunn "James Dunn") agrees with this idea, stating that
"Paul was reacting primarily against the exclusivism that he
himself had previously fought to maintain," ("Paul's Theology," in
*The Face of New Testament Studies*, p. 336). Having briefly
outlined the NPP's understanding of Paul's negative reaction to
Judaism, it appears difficult to understand NPP proponents
reasonings. Westerholm thus asks the pressing question, "If Judaism
preached good Protestant doctrine after all, then what could Paul
possibly have found wrong with it?"
(*Perspectives Old and New on Paul*, p. 250).

## Other issues

The title "other issues" is not meant to imply that these topics
are outside the scheme or core of the ensuing debate on Paul.
However, some of the following issues tend to divide NPP proponents
in that not all of them agree on what is meant, for example, by
"works of the law." Some issues, however, *are* more generally
accepted such as "boundary markers."

### Works of the Law

"The key questions involve Paul's view(s) of the law and the
meaning of the controversy in which Paul was engaged. Paul strongly
argued that we are "justified by faith in Christ (or "the faith of
Christ") and not by doing the works of the law" (Gal. 2:16b). Since
the time of [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"), this
has been understood as an indictment of legalistic efforts to merit
favor before God." [[1]](http://www.thepaulpage.com/Summary.html)

James Dunn explains that,

"'Works of law', 'works of the law' are nowhere understood here,
either by his Jewish interlocutors or by Paul himself, as works
which earn God's favor, as merit-amassing observances. They are
rather seen as badges: they are simply what membership of the
covenant people involves, what mark out the Jews as God's
people;...in other words, Paul has in view precisely what Sanders
calls 'covenantal nomism.' And what he denies is that God's
justification depends on 'covenantal nomism,' that God's grace
extends only to those who wear the badge of the covenant."
[[2]](http://www.thepaulpage.com/Summary.html)
Dunn notes elsewhere that these "badges" can also be called
boundary markers (see below). Futhermore, at the tenth Edinburgh
Dogmatics Conference (2003), N.T. Wright explained his agreements
and disagreements with James Dunn.

"... when Jimmy Dunn added his stones to the growing pile I found
myself in both agreement and disagreement with him. His proposal
about the meaning of ‘works of the law’ in Paul – that they are not
the moral works through which one gains merit but the works through
which the Jew is defined over against the pagan – I regard as
exactly right. It has proved itself again and again in the detailed
exegesis; attempts to deny it have in my view failed. But Dunn,
like Sanders (and like some other New Perspetive writers such as
John Ziesler) has not, I think, got to the heart of Paul. Again,
much of my writing on Paul over the last twenty years at least has
been in at least implicit dialogue with him, and I find his
exposition of justification itself less than satisfying. For one
thing, he never understands what I take to be Paul’s fundamental
covenant theology; for another, his typically protestant
anti-sacramentalism leads him to miss the point of Romans 6."
[[3]](http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_New_Perspectives.htm)
### Boundary Markers

Boundary markers are observances such as circumcision, food laws,
the sabbath etc. that separated the Jews from the Gentiles. One
could distinguish who was a Jew or Gentile by seeing who followed
these laws. Specifically, this set up the boundaries of identifying
who were and were not God's people. It is proposed within the New
Perspective that Paul came to do away with these "boundary markers"
so that Jew and Gentile would be unified and so that the
[Abrahamic covenant](Abrahamic_covenant "Abrahamic covenant") could
be actualized (Gen 12:2-3, where all nations are blessed). Thus, it
is argued, when Paul criticized the Jews for adhering to "works of
the law," he was referring to these "boundary markers" rather than
a system of works-righteousness, as is presumed in the traditional
understanding of Paul's arguments.

### The righteousness of God

Proponents of New Perspectivism argue that the righteousness of
God, spoken of by Paul in Romans, is refering to God's faithfulness
rather than the positive imputation of Christ's righteousness.

"If we use the language of the law court, it makes no sense
whatsoever to say that the judge imputes, imparts, bequeaths,
conveys or otherwise transfers his righteousness to either the
plaintiff or the defendant. Righteousness is not an object, a
substance or a gas which can be passed across the courtroom. For
the judge to be righteous does not mean that the court has found in
his favor. For the plaintiff or defendant to be righteous does not
mean that he or she has tried the case properly or impartially. To
imagine the defendant somehow receiving the judge's righteousness
is simply a category mistake. That is not how the language works."
- [N.T. Wright](http://www.thepaulpage.com/Summary.html)
### Faith vs. works

NPP advocates argue that the traditional dichotomy of faith and
works isn't present in Paul. Rather present is a dichotomy of
"covenant badges" like circumcision and distinctively Jewish
practices vs. the all-inclusive instrument of faith (which allow
Gentiles into this convenant).

### Boasting in Jewish culture

[Simon Gathercole](Simon_Gathercole "Simon Gathercole") has written
a solid book, *Where is Boasting?* (2002), which deals with the
theme of "boasting" in second-temple Judaism and Romans 1-5. Having
actually studied under [James Dunn](James_Dunn "James Dunn"),
Gathercole's book critiques the NPP and shows that "obedience, as
well as election, is the basis of Israel's confidence before God,"
(p. 194). This is important in that it establishes that election is
not the sole basis of Israel's confidence. Furthermore, Gathercole
concludes that because Jewish confidence is placed in both their
election *and* obedience, "boasting in God cannot be glossed as
'boasting in Torah'... there is room only for a boast through
Christ," (p. 261). In other words, the very thought that
[Paul](Paul "Paul") was fighting was a boasting in the Torah, or
the Law that made Israel a distinct nation. He goes on to deepen
his point,

Paul affirms a crucial component, then, to true boasting. To pose
the question from the other side, What is it in the Jewish boast
that Paul excludes? We have seen in our exegesis of Romans 2:17-24
and 2:25-29 that Paul does not accept the Jewish boast "in God"
(2:17) at face value. The problem with the boast is that the [Jew]
has an unrepentant heart, and, though he calls himself a Jew
(2:17), he is actually not a Jew in his heart (2:25-29). The boast
in God is undercut chiefly by the fact that the [Jew] sins against
the Torah even as he claims it as the basis for his confidence
(2:23). The boast of the Jew, then, is for Paul something very
different from the boast of the Christians in Romans 5:1-11 (p.
261).
## N.T. Wright

As stated above, NPP proponents agree on some things, however not
all see things the same way.
[N.T. Wright](N.T._Wright "N.T. Wright") has been the most
outspoken regarding the redefinition of the doctrine of
[justification](Justification "Justification"),
[imputed righteousness](Imputed_righteousness "Imputed righteousness"),
and the idea of "exile" within first century Judaism. Anyone
wishing to understand the New Perspective should understand and be
familiar with his writings as he is the most widely read of any NPP
writer.

### Justification

According to Wright, justification isn't merely an *initial means*
by which someone is right with [God](God "God"), but rather a mark
of who already is. He notes,

"[T]he doctrine of justification by faith is not what Paul means by
'the gospel'. It is implied by the gospel; when the gospel is
proclaimed, people come to faith and so are regarded by God as
members of his people. But 'the gospel' is not an account of how
people get saved. It is, as we saw in an earlier chapter, the
proclamation of the lordship of Jesus Christ....Let us be quite
clear. 'The gospel' is the announcement of Jesus' lordship, which
works with power to bring people into the family of Abraham, now
redefined around Jesus Christ and characterized solely by faith in
him. 'Justification' is the doctrine which insists that all those
who have this faith belong as full members of this family, on this
basis and no other." [[4]](http://www.thepaulpage.com/Summary.html)
Another quote by Wright is worth reading:

"In theology, therefore, justification is not the means whereby it
becomes possible to declare someone in the right. It is simply that
declaration itself. It is not how someone becomes a Christian, but
simply the declaration that someone is a Christian. It is not the
exercise of mercy, but the just declaration concerning one who has
already received mercy. This is a crucial distinction, without
which it is impossible to understand the biblical material."
[[5]](http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Justification_Biblical_Basis.pdf)
(pdf)
Thus, justification has more to do with Jewish-Gentile issues
rather than one's status before God. The result is that those who
push for the NPP understand themselves dealing with Judaism on its
own grounds rather than through the lens of the Catholic-Protestant
debates of the 16th century. They see themselves taking a
historical approach to the issue and criticize opponents as reading
their view of justification into the text in the same way
[Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") did.

### Denial of imputed righteousness

N.T. Wright reinterprets texts classically used as prooftexts for
[imputed righteousness](Imputed_righteousness "Imputed righteousness").
He understands 2 Corinthians 5:21, for example, to refer to God's
covenant faithfulness. While many still profess agreement with the
substance of the [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of imputed
righteousness, the classic (or traditional) interpretations of
texts relating to imputation have more or less been removed (see
also N.T. Wright's
[Becoming the Righteousness of God](http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Becoming_Righteousness.pdf)
PDF). Wright also states,

"Is there then no 'reckoning of righteousness' in, for instance,
Romans 5:14-21? Yes, there is; but my case is that this is not
God's own righteousness, or Christ's own righteousness, that is
reckoned to God's redeemed people, but rather the fresh status of
'covenant member', and/or 'justified sinner', which is accredited
to those who are in Christ, who have heard the gospel and responded
with 'the obedience of faith'." - Rutherford House Conference 2003
[[6]](http://www.gen2rev.com/resources/ntw/New_Perspectives_on_Paul.pdf)
(pdf, p. 8)
Wright does not believe God's righteousness is anything that he can
*give* or that can be *transfered* to a believer. The believer is
simply *declared* righteous because he is now a covenant member.

### Still in Exile?

Wright thinks that the many of the Jews of Jesus' day regarded
Israel as 'still in exile' and that Messiah's coming would deliver
the captives, release God's people from exile, and restore God's
kingdom from foreign domination; it would in fact be the right
ordering of God over the foreign nations through Israel. In line
with this understanding, Wright regards much of Jesus' action as an
enactment of this part of the "salvation story." Moreover, in this
story the political nature comes out strongly. By consequence,
Wright tends to deemphasize, though he does not deny, the personal
nature of salvation in Christ. This understanding and emphasis
often clashes with the evangelical historic reformed faith which
has consistently held the focus of Jesus' message to be 'personal
forgiveness of sin by vicarious sacrificial atonement of Jesus as
Passover Lamb'.

## Other criticism(s)

### Justification and Variegated Nomism

*Justification and Variegated Nomism* is a two-volume work, the
first being published in 2001, the second in 2004, which deals with
the claims of the NPP. The title of this work is not intended to be
intimidating. Basically, the two-volume work deals with the
doctrine of [justification](Justification "Justification") and
variegated (varying) nomism (Greek for *law*) in Second-Temple
Judaism (ca. 515 BC - 70 AD) and the thought of the Apostle
[Paul](Paul "Paul"). In other words, scholars sought to better
understand the varying views of justification and the law is
second-temple judaism and Pauline thought. The two-volume series is
edited by [D.A. Carson](D.A._Carson "D.A. Carson"), Peter O'Brien,
and Mark Seifrid.

In the first volume, subtitled "The Complexities of Second Temple
Judaism," Carson notes that they "divided up the literature of
Second Temple Judaism and invited distinguished specialists to look
at it afresh, asking fundamental questions about the pattern of
relationships between God and human beings, about righteousness and
salvation and eschatology and grace and works and faith and law,"
(v-vi). Thus, the first volume focuses on the same literature that
Sander's *Paul and Palestinian Judaism* did, showing that his
"covenantal nomism" is not the sole "pattern of religion."

Carson also states in the preface to the second volume, subtitled
"The Paradoxes of Paul," that the book tries "to look at the
exegetical and theological arguments advanced by the new
perspective in its treatment of Paul, undertaking fresh exegesis of
most of the relevant texts while interacting with the dominant
voices," (v-vi).

This two-volume set is the most solid and well-reasoned response to
New Perspective proponents. Although considered more advanced
reading, the entire work is broken into separate articles which
enables interested readers to read one article at a time rather
than being required to take in and understand the entire 1,100 page
text.
