### Historicity of the New Testament


*See main article: [Historicity of the New Testament](Historicity_of_the_New_Testament "Historicity of the New Testament")*
### New Testament use of the Old Testament

The New Testament use of the Old Testament is an important issue
within the study of the interpretation of the Bible and especially
messianic prophecies concerning Jesus. "The fourth edition of the
United Bible Societies' Greek Testament (1993) lists 343 Old
Testament quotations in the New Testament, as well as no fewer than
2, 309 allusions and verbal parallels. The books most used are
Psalms (79 quotations, 333 allusions), and Isaiah (66 quotations,
348 allusions). In the Book of Revelation, there are no formal
quotations at all, but no fewer than 620 allusions."

*See main article: [New Testament use of the Old Testament](New_Testament_use_of_the_Old_Testament "New Testament use of the Old Testament")*
### New Testament Textual Criticism

New Testament Textual Criticism examines the existing manuscript
witnesses to the New Testament in order to produce a text that is
as close as possible to the original. The New Testament has been
preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work, having
over 5,300 Greek manuscripts dating from the 3rd century to the
16th century. The task of the textual critic, therefore, is to sort
through the variants and establish a "critical text" that is
intended to represent the original by best explaining the state of
all extant witnesses.
