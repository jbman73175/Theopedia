**New Testament Textual Criticism** examines the existing
manuscript witnesses to the New Testament in order to produce a
text that is as close as possible to the original. The New
Testament has been preserved in more manuscripts than any other
ancient work, having over 5,300 Greek manuscripts dating from the
3rd century to the 16th century. The task of the textual critic,
therefore, is to sort through the variants and establish a
"critical text" that is intended to represent the original by best
explaining the state of all extant witnesses.

## The King James versus modern translations

### Textual basis for the King James Version

"[Erasmus](Erasmus "Erasmus"), a Dutch scholar, under patronage of
Froben the printer of Basel, had been preparing a Greek NT and it
was published early in 1516. "It was the first published (printed
with movable type) Greek New Testament. At the urging of a
publisher who wanted to do be first, he prepared it very hastily,
as he himself admitted. He had only about *half a dozen* Greek
manuscripts, none of them earlier than the tenth century AD. In
1522 Erasmus published his third edition. His 4th edition in 1537
contains his definitive text.

"The next important step was taken by Robert Estienne (Stephanus),
whose 3rd edition, "Regia," a folio published in Paris in 1550, was
a distinct advance, and, though based directly upon the work of
Ximenes and Erasmus, had marginal readings from 15 new manuscripts,
one of which was *Codex Bezae*. Theodore Beza himself worked with
Stephanus' son Henri and brought out nine editions of the NT, but
no great critical advance was made in them. The same may be said of
the seven Elzevir editions brought out at Leyden and Amsterdam
between 1624 and 1678, the second, that of 1633, in the preface of
which occurs the phrase "**Textum** ergo habes nune ab omnibus
**receptum**", became the continental standard, as the 1550 edition
of Stephanus had for England. The 1550 edition of Stephanus was the
so called "Textus Receptus", used by the translators of the KJV."

### Textual basis for modern translations

The eighteenth century brought the recovery of many additional
early NT Greek manuscripts which led to great strides in the study
of these witnesses. Collation, categorization, and textual analysis
of the many manuscripts led to the development of proposed Greek
texts which departed from the Textus Receptus of the KJV. Critical
Greek texts published by Constantin Tischendorf (1849), Karl
Lachmann (1850), and Samuel P. Tregelles (1857-1872) led to the
Westcott-Hort Greek New Testament (1881) of which major portions
were used in the translation of the English Revised Version of
1881. While scholarly controversy and differing views accompanied
the early use of the new "critical" Greek texts, a permanent shift
away from the Textus Receptus had begun.

The Greek text which underlies most modern translations such as the
[NASB](NASB "NASB") (1971), [NIV](NIV "NIV") (1973) and
[ESV](ESV "ESV") (2001) is currently published as the United Bible
Societies' *Greek New Testament*, 4th edition (usually cited UBS4),
and the essentially identical
[Nestle-Aland](Nestle-Aland "Nestle-Aland")
*Novum Testamentum Graece*, 27th edition (usually cited NA27).

This Greek text is described both as a critical text and an
eclectic text. It is "critical" in that it contains a scholarly
"apparatus" which footnotes the major textual variations with
specific identification of particular ancient manuscripts (MSS). It
is "eclectic" because the text itself is the result of a committee
endeavor which takes what is deemed to be the "best" reading of a
verse or passage to arrive at a concensus regardless of the
particular manuscript, type, or family. In general, the current
critical texts follow the Alexandrian text type but is not as
radically Alexandrian as Westcott and Hort Greek text of 1881.

For some elementary insight into the criteria used in arriving at
an "eclectic" text and the various text types which exist, see
below.

## Don't make a mountain out of a mole hill

The details of the textual variants among the existing manuscripts
is the focus of
[textual criticism](Biblical_criticism "Biblical criticism").
Discussions regarding "which is the best Greek text" can often
cause concern for the laymen. However, we should not let scholarly
concerns "make a mountain out of a mole hill."

"When one examines the variations between the Greek text behind the
KJV (the Textus Receptus) and the Greek text behind modern
translations, it is discovered that the vast majority of variations
are so trivial as to not even be translatable (the most common is
the moveable *nu*, which is akin to the difference between "who"
and "whom!) . . . When one compares the number of variations that
are found in the various MSS with the actual variations between the
Textus Receptus and the best Greek witnesses, it is found that
these two are remarkably similar. There are over 400,000 textual
variants among NT MSS. But the differences between the Textus
Receptus and texts based on the best Greek witnesses number about
5000 -- and most of these are untranslatable differences! In other
words, over 98% of the time, the Textus Receptus and the standard
critical editions agree."
[Daniel Wallace](http://www.bible.org/page.asp?page_id=665)

## Criteria in modern translations

Twelve Basic Rules for NT Textual Criticism, (*Aland*, 275-276).

-   Only one reading can be original, however many variant readings
    there may be.
-   Only the readings which best satisfies the requirements of both
    external and internal criteria can be original.
-   Criticism of the text must always begin from the evidence of
    the manuscript tradition and only afterward turn to a consideration
    of internal criteria.
-   Internal criteria (the context of the passage, its style and
    vocabulary, the theological environment of the author, etc.) can
    never be the sole basis for a critical decision, especially when
    they stand in opposition to the external evidence.
-   The primary authority for a critical textual decision lies with
    the Greek manuscript tradition, with the version and Fathers
    serving no more than a supplementary and corroborative function,
    particularly in passages where their underlying Greek text cannot
    be reconstructed with absolute certainty.
-   Furthermore, manuscripts should be weighed, not counted, and
    the peculiar traits of each manuscript should be duly considered.
    However important the early papyri, or a particular uncial, or a
    minuscule may be, there is no single manuscript or group of
    manuscripts that can be followed mechanically, even though certain
    combinations of witnesses may deserve a greater degree of
    confidence than others. Rather, decisions in textual criticism must
    be worked out afresh, passage by passage (the local principle).
-   The principle that the original reading may be found in any
    single manuscript or version when it stands alone or nearly alone
    is only a theoretical possibility. Any form of eclecticism which
    accepts this principle will hardly succeed in establishing the
    original text of the New Testament; it will only confirm the view
    of the text which it presupposes.
-   The reconstruction of a stemma of readings for each variant
    (the genealogical principle) is an extremely important device,
    because the reading which can most easily explain the derivation of
    the other forms is itself most likely the original.
-   Variants must never be treated in isolation, but always
    considered in the context of the tradition. Otherwise there is too
    great a danger of reconstructing a "test tube text" which never
    existed at any time or place.
-   There is truth in the maxim: *lectio difficilior lectio potior*
    ("the more difficult reading is the more probable reading"). But
    this principle must not be taken too mechanically, with the most
    difficult reading (lectio difficilima) adopted as original simply
    because of its degree of difficulty.
-   The venerable maxim *lectio brevior lectio potior* ("the
    shorter reading is the more probable reading") is certainly right
    in many instances. But here again the principle cannot be applied
    mechanically.
-   A constantly maintained familiarity with New Testament
    manuscripts themselves is the best training for textual criticism.
    In textual criticism the pure theoretician has often done more harm
    than good.

## Text Types

The following is adapted from *Briggs*, 45-47.

New Testament manuscripts can be classified according to certain
major families or types. A family type is the name given to a group
of texts with a common ancestor. These texts are discerned through
the deviations common to a group of manuscripts. For example, some
scribal errors made in copying the text in Alexandria were
perpetuated in later reproductions of that text type.
Classification according to "text type" is the basic point of
departure in the actual work of textual reconstruction. For
example, one reading of a text that represents a good family type
may provide more support for the original text than a dozen
readings from a poor family type. These text types are not
represented by entire manuscripts but often only segments of them.
The modern practice of copying an entire manuscript of the New
Testament at once was seldom followed in antiquity. Four family
"types" of texts have been sufficiently defined in biblical
scholarship to merit listing below.

### The Alexandrian Text

This text arose in Egypt and is generally conceded to be the most
important one. Westcott and Hort, who named this the Neutral Text,
thought that *Codex Sinaiticus* (4th century) and *Codex Vaticanus*
(4th century) had preserved a pure form of the Alexandrian type of
text. *Codex* is Latin meaning *book*, i.e. these manuscripts were
found bound in book form rather than as scrolls. These two
Alexandian texts each comprise almost the entire New Testament as
well as significant portions of the
[Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint"). It is now evident that these
manuscripts had been corrected by later scribes, but they are the
most ancient uncials and preserve the Alexandrian text at an early
stage. Some of the important papyrus manuscripts also represent
this family.

### The Byzantine Text

This family has been designated by many names. It is called
Byzantine because it was adopted in Constantinople and used as the
common text in the Byzantine world. It was produced in Antioch,
Syria, under the direction of Lucian near the beginning of the
fourth century and has been called the Syrian or Antiochene text.
It was used almost universally after the eight century. Both
Erasmus, who created the first printed Greek text, and the
translators of the King James Version of the Bible used this type
of text. It was produced by combining earlier texts and has less
value than the Alexandrian text. A (*Codex Alexandrinus*, 5th
century) and C (*Codex Ephraemi*, 5th century) are the oldest
representatives of the Byzantine family. A great majority of late
uncials and minuscules belong to this group.

### The Western Text

This family of texts was closely related to the church in the west,
particularly in North Africa. Although it can probably be traced to
the second century, its value has been disputed. It was used by the
early church fathers. Its age would seem to suggest great
importance, but there are clear indications that it was not
carefully preserved. It is best represented by the Old Latin
translations, by the Syriac versions, and the church fathers. Its
most famous representative is manuscript D (*Codex Bezae*) for the
book of Acts.

### The Caesarean Text

This family of texts was widely used in Caesarea from which it
derived its name. It seems to have arisen out of the Alexandrian
text but was also mixed with the Western text. Consequently, its
value is limited. Metzger suggests that it is necessary to
distinguish between two stages in its development, the
pre-Caesarean and the Caesarean (*Metzger*, p. 215). Some of its
more prominent representatives are W (*Washington Codex*, fifth
century), *P45*, and two groups of minuscules and lectionaries.

## Comment on the confidence and accuracy of the NT Text

"At present, we have more than 6,000 manuscript copies of the Greek
New Testament or portions thereof. No other work of Greek
literature can boast of such numbers. Homer's *Iliad*, the greatest
of all Greek classical works, is extant in about 650 manuscripts;
and Euripides' tragedies exist in about 330 manuscripts. The
numbers on all the other works of Greek literature are far less.
Furthermore, it must be said that the amount of time between the
original composition and the next surviving manuscript is far less
for the New Testament than for any other work in Greek literature.
The lapse for most classical Greek works is about eight hundred to
a thousand years; whereas the lapse for many books in the New
Testament is around one hundred years. Because of the abundant
wealth of manuscripts and because several of the manuscripts are
dated in the early centuries of the church, New Testament textual
scholars have a great advantage over classical textual scholars.
The New Testament scholars have the resources to reconstruct the
original text of the New Testament with great accuracy, and they
have produced some excellent editions of the Greek New Testament.

"Finally, it must be said that, although there are certainly
differences in many of the New Testament manuscripts, not one
fundamental doctrine of the Christian faith rests on a disputed
reading. Frederic Kenyon, a renowned paleographer and textual
critic, affirmed this when he said, 'The Christian can take the
whole Bible in his hand and say without fear or hesitation that he
holds in it the true Word of God, handed down without essential
loss from generation to generation throughout the centuries.' " --
