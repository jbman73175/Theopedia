The **New Testament use of the Old Testament** is a topic in New
Testament Studies where scholars study why NT authors quoted
various OT passages. It is an important issue within the study of
the
[interpretation of the Bible](Interpretation_of_the_Bible "Interpretation of the Bible"),
especially in the area of
[messianic prophecies](Messianic_prophecy "Messianic prophecy")
concerning [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). "The fourth edition of the
United Bible Societies' Greek Testament (1993) lists 343 Old
Testament quotations in the New Testament, as well as no fewer than
2,309 allusions and verbal parallels. The books most used are
Psalms (79 quotations, 333 allusions), and Isaiah (66 quotations,
348 allusions). In the Book of Revelation, there are no formal
quotations at all, but no fewer than 620
allusions."^[[1]](#note-0)^ Furthermore, "the OT is quoted or
alluded to in every NT writing except
[Philemon](Epistle_to_Philemon "Epistle to Philemon") and 2 and 3
John."^[[2]](#note-1)^

Writers in the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") felt
free to use [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") passages
for many different reasons (e.g. apologetic, moral, doctrinal).
What exactly were the interpretive techniques used by the NT
writers? Are they justified in the way that they quote the OT? Did
they have a concern for context? These questions are important and
too often neglected in the study of the NT. In order to interpret
passages correctly, it is important to understand how and why they
used the OT as they did.

## Interpretive assumptions by NT authors

Evident among the NT writers are varying assumptions, that is,
presuppositions they held that shed light on how and why they
interpreted the OT as they did.

### View of the OT

#### Relevance of the OT

The NT writers viewed the Old Testament as an entire unit. God was
it's author, and the NT writers believed that what was written then
still had meaning for their day and time. Because the OT was true,
prophecy found within its texts were to also be regarded as true,
meaning the promises that were made were to accompany an
expectation of fulfillment.^[[3]](#note-2)^ [Paul's](Paul "Paul")
view of the OT fits this mold when he says that everything that
"was written in former days was written for our instruction, that
through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures
we might have hope" (Romans 15:4).

#### The OT as the Word of God

It should also be noted that the NT writers, including
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") himself, believed the OT to be the Word of
God. An often quoted passage, 2 Timothy 3:16 states that "All
Scripture is God-breathed." The "all Scripture" is to be understood
as a reference of [Paul](Paul "Paul") to the OT. Elsewhere, Paul
writes that "They [the Jews] have been entrusted with the very
words of God," (Rom 3:2). Jesus, while dealing with the topic of
[divorce](Divorce "Divorce"), quotes Genesis 2:24 in Matthew 19:5.
It is interesting to note that Genesis 2:24 is part of the
narrative of [creation](Creation "Creation") rather than a direct
utterance of God ^[[4]](#note-3)^. Other general examples of the OT
as the Word of God include Mark 12:36, Acts 1:16, Acts 28:25, and
Hebrews 1:5-8.

### Typology

The term [typology](Typology "Typology") comes from the Greek word
*typos* which literally means "impression," or "mark". Also, "it is
not so much a method of exegesis as it is a presupposition
underlying the Jewish and Christian understandings of Scripture,
particularly its historical portions" ^[[5]](#note-4)^. The basic
idea of typology is that the story of the past has some kind of
bearing on the present. Furthermore, the present can be seen as
having been foreshadowed in the biblical story. What makes typology
different from allegory (see below) is that typology is closely
tied to history.

Within typology, the event (or even person) that happened in the
past is seen as the "type". For example, the great event of the
exodus is seen as a "type" for the post-exilic return to the land
of Israel (Isaiah 43:16-17). Moreover, Jesus gives a comparison of
the judgment that fell on Sodom with the coming final judgment
(Luke 17:28-30). Probably the best known example in the NT is that
of Jonah's experience with that of Jesus' burial and resurrection.
Yet, of all the writings in the NT, Hebrews makes the shows the
most extensive use of typology (ibid., p. 134; Matt 12:40; Luke
11:30).

## Exegetical methods

Differing exegetical methods existed during the time of the NT
writers. By "exegetical methods" it is meant the methods by which
individuals used to interpret portions of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament").

### Midrash

Midrash comes from the [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew") word *darash*,
meaning "search" or even "commentary". It "entails searching the
text for clarification beyond the obvious ^[[6]](#note-5)^. In
other words, midrash is a method which involves commentary on a
specific passage of the [Bible](Bible "Bible"). "In 'searching' the
sacred text, the rabbis attempted to update scriptural teaching to
make it relevant to new circumstances and issues. This was approach
was felt to be legitimate because Scripture was understood as
divine in character and therefore could yield many meanings and
applications..." ^[[7]](#note-6)^. One of the best examples in the
NT is John 6:25-59 which comments on Exodus 16:4, Psalm 78:24 (cf.
Jn 6:31). Jesus' words are considered by some scholars as a running
"commentary" on this passage found in the
[book of Exodus](Book_of_Exodus "Book of Exodus").

#### Light and heavy

One of the most significant midrashic methods is known as light and
heavy. According to this method, if something is true in a less
important, "light" situation, it proves important in a greater,
"heavier", situation. For example, Jesus assures his disciples that
since God cares for the birds (light), he also cares for them
(heavy; Matt 6:26; cf. Luke 12:24). This method is usually
recognized by an "if" statement followed by a "how much more...",
found both in the words of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") and
[Paul](Paul "Paul") (cf. Matt 7:11; Rom 5:10).

#### Equivalence

The rule of equivalence is seen when "passages clarify one another
if they share common vocabulary ^[[8]](#note-7)^. Consider 1 Peter
2:4-8 which quotes Isaiah 28:16, Psalm 118:22, and Isaiah 8:14.
Here, the term "stone" is used in equivalent regulation. Another
example is Jesus' use of 1 Samuel 21:6 in Mark 2:23-28.

### Pesher

After the discovery of the
[Dead Sea Scrolls](Dead_Sea_Scrolls "Dead Sea Scrolls") (DSS),
scholars concluded that these and other writings found were from a
community called Qumran. The community was a group of Essenes,
considered isolationists, who had split off and found the area
known as Qumran. Qumran serves as a good example of the method of
*pesher*, for at Qumran "scripture was viewed as containing
mysteries in need of explanation. The 'pesher' was the explanation
of the mystery", usually involved in prophecies ^[[9]](#note-8)^.
Examples include Acts 2:17-21 citing Joel 2:28-32, and Mark
12:10-11 citing Psalms 118:22-23 (cf. Eph 3:4-6).

### Allegorical

Some NT writers also understood the OT allegorically. Caution is
due, in that this method is the least common, yet its place and
presence in the NT should still be noted. Allegorical
interpretation typically involves a symbolic meaning found within a
text. There is, to some degree, a deeper meaning that is beneath
the obvious letter of the passage ^[[10]](#note-9)^. The best known
first-century allegorist was
[Philo of Alexandria](index.php?title=Philo_of_Alexandria&action=edit&redlink=1 "Philo of Alexandria (page does not exist)").
However, the most obvious example in the NT can be found in on of
Paul's letters, Galatians 4:24-31. In this text,
[Sarah](index.php?title=Sarah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sarah (page does not exist)")
and
[Hagar](index.php?title=Hagar&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hagar (page does not exist)")
symbolize two [covenants](Covenant "Covenant"). It should be noted
that Jesus' parables are not allegories although they do sometimes
contain allegorical features (ibid.; cf. Mark 12:1-9).
