The **New Atheism** is a movement which puts atheism "on the front
lines of current cultural conversation."
[[1]](http://www.albertmohler.com/commentary_read.php?cdate=2006-11-21)
It is spearheaded by people such as Richard Dawkins, Christopher
Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett. Out of these four,
Richard Dawkins is considered to be the leader. The New Atheists
are dramatically opposed to any and all types of theism, especially
Christian theism. "What the New Atheists share is a belief that
religion should not simply be tolerated but should be countered,
criticized and exposed by rational argument wherever its influence
arises."
[[2]](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/08/atheism.feature/index.html)

The movement is exemplified by books such as *The God Delusion*
(Richard Dawkins),
*God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything* (Christopher
Hitchens), *Letter to a Christian Nation* (Sam Harris), and
*Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon* (Daniel
Dennett).

## Criticism

The New Atheism has received significant criticism from Christian
apologists, with numerous books being written in response. Many of
the arguments presented by the New Atheists have been criticized by
Christian apologists as being generally weak, with the prominent
figures behind the New Atheism receiving criticism for writing
about issues which are outside their fields of expertise. The noted
analytic philosopher
[Alvin Plantinga](Alvin_Plantinga "Alvin Plantinga") has stated
that many of Richard Dawkins's philosophical arguments in his book
*The God Delusion* "would receive a failing grade in a sophomore
philosophy class."
