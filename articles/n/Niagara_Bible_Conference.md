In 1883 a group of Christian bible scholars met for the first time
at Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, near Niagara Falls and established
the principles of Christian fundamentalism. It was here that the
**Niagara Bible Conference** gathered every year from 1883 through
1897 (with the exception of 1884). It met at the Queen's Royal
Hotel and its pavilion. James Brooks, in his *Truth* magazine
describes the meeting of 1892 as one

"more largely attended than ever before. Often every seat in the
pavilion was occupied, and the porches were filled with eager
hearers of the Word. The place too becomes more beautiful as the
years go by, and it would be difficult to find a spot better suited
to the quiet and prayerful study of the Sacred Scriptures. The
building in which the Conference meets, overlooking Lake Ontario
and the River Niagara, and surrounded by green trees, is secluded
from the noise of the world; and so excellent were the arrangements
for the accommodation of the guests, both in Queen's Royal Hotel
and in the boarding houses of the village, that not a word of
complaint was heard from any one."
Some of the scholars who were present, known as the founding
fathers of Fundamentalism, were W.E. Blackstone, Charles Erdman,
[James H. Brookes](James_H._Brookes "James H. Brookes"), William
Moorehead, A.J. Gordon, A.C. Dixon,
[C.I. Scofield](Cyrus_I._Scofield "Cyrus I. Scofield"), and
[J. Hudson Taylor](J._Hudson_Taylor "J. Hudson Taylor") (who
founded the China Inland Mission).

The messages generally centered on the doctrines of
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"), the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit"), the Bible,
[missions](Missions "Missions") and
[prophecy](Prophecy "Prophecy").
[Premillennialism](Premillennialism "Premillennialism") was
defended and taught. Article XIV of the 1878 Niagara Bible
Conference Creed states,

"We believe that the world will not be converted during the present
dispensation, but is fast ripening for judgment, while there will
be a fearful apostasy in the professing Christian body; and hence
that the Lord Jesus will come in person to introduce the millennial
age, when Israel shall be restored to their own land, and the earth
shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord; and that this personal
and premillennial advent is the blessed hope set before us in the
Gospel for which we should be constantly looking."
Some of the contributions of the Niagara Conference were:

-   The conference spawned new missionary activity and evangelism
-   The conference contributed to the rise and spread of a large
    Bible conference movement (such as the Northfield conferences)
-   The conference had a significant impact on the rise of the
    Bible institute and Bible college movement
-   The conference gave early expression to Fundamentalism's
    emphasis on concentrated Bible study
-   The conference precipitated a vast amount of Fundamentalist
    literature, especially on the subjects of prophecy, the Person and
    work of Christ, the Holy Spirit and missions.
