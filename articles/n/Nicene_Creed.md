The **Nicene Creed** is a Christian statement of faith accepted by
the [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic"),
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox"),
[Anglican](Anglican "Anglican"), and most
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") churches. It gets its name
from the
[First Council of Nicaea](First_Council_of_Nicaea "First Council of Nicaea")
(325 A.D.), where it was initially adopted, and from the
[First Council of Constantinople](First_Council_of_Constantinople "First Council of Constantinople")
(381 A.D.), where a revised version was accepted. Thus it may be
referred to specifically as the **Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed**
to distinguish it from the original 325 A.D. version.

The original Nicene Creed adopted in 325 ended just after the
words, "We believe in the Holy Spirit..." Content was added at the
First Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 381 A.D.; hence the
name "Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed", which refers to the
modified or updated creed. The
[Third Ecumenical Council](Third_Ecumenical_Council "Third Ecumenical Council")
in Ephesus (431 A.D.) reaffirmed the creed in this form and
explicitly forbade making additional revisions to it.

There have been other subsequent [creeds](Creed "Creed") formulated
to guard against perceived [heresy](Heresy "Heresy"), but this one,
as revised in 381 A.D., was the last time both the Western
(Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) churches were in united agreement
on a *Credo*. This creed is not to be confused with the later
[Athanasian Creed](Athanasian_Creed "Athanasian Creed").

Maker of all things visible and invisible.

Almighty, Maker of *heaven and earth, and of all* things visible

**325 Nicene Creed.** And in one Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of
God, begotten of the Father [the only-begotten; that is, of the
essence of the Father, God of God], Light of Light, very God of
very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance
(*homoousion*)with the Father; by whom all things were made [both
in heaven and on earth]; who for us men, and for our salvation,
came down and was incarnate and was made man; he suffered, and the
third day he rose again, ascended into heaven; from thence he shall
come to judge the quick and the dead.

**381 Constantinopolitan Creed.** And in one Lord Jesus Christ ,
the *only-begotten* Son of God, begotten of the Father

down *from heaven*, and was incarnate
*by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary*, and was made man; he
*was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate*, and suffered,
*and was buried*, and the third day he rose again,

the world to come. Amen.

**325 Nicene Creed.** [But those who say: 'There was a time when he
was not;' and 'He was not before he was made;' and 'He was made out

Son of God is created,' or 'changeable,' or 'alterable'—they are
condemned by the holy catholic and apostolic Church.]"

## A contemporary English-language translation

Prepared by the International Consultation on English Texts, this
version is used by many mainline communions in the United States
and other English-speaking countries.

We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven
and earth, of all that is seen and unseen.
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God,
eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, light from light,
true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in Being with the
Father.
For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven, by the power
of the Holy Spirit he was born of the Virgin Mary and became truly
human.
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered,
died and was buried.
On the third day he rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures; he
ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and
his kingdom will have no end.
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who
proceeds from the Father [and the Son]. Who with the Father and the
Son is worshiped and glorified. Who has spoken through the
prophets. We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We
acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for
the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.
Amen.
