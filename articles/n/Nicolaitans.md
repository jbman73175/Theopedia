**Nicolaitans** were one of the heretical sects that plagued the
churches at Ephesus and at Pergamum, according to Revelation
2:6,15. [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") identifies them as
followers of Nicolas, one of the seven chosen in Acts 6, and as men
who "lead lives of unrestrained indulgence"^[[1]](#note-0)^. He
also relates them to [Gnosticism](Gnosticism "Gnosticism"): "John,
the disciple of the Lord, preaches this faith (the deity of
Christ), and seeks, by the proclamation of the Gospel, to remove
that error which by Cerinthus had been disseminated among men, and
a long time previously by those termed Nicolaitans, who are an
offset of that 'knowledge' falsely so called, that he might
confound them, and persuade them that there is but one God, who
made all things by His Word"^[[2]](#note-1)^. There is also
historical evidence of a Gnostic sect called Nitolaitans a century
or so later.

The doctrine of the Nicolaitans appears to have been a form of
[antinomianism](Antinomianism "Antinomianism"), which makes the
fatal mistake that man can freely partake in sin because the Law of
God is no longer binding. It held the truth on the gratuitous
reckoning of righteousness; but supposed that a mere intellectual
"belief" in this truth had a saving power.

Nicolaitans of the 2nd century seem to have continued and extended
the views of the 1st century adherents, holding to the freedom of
the flesh and sin, and teaching that the deeds of the flesh had no
effect upon the health of the soul and consequently no relation to
salvation.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

Today, the doctrine is now largely taught that the gospel of Christ
has made God's law of no effect: that by "believing" we are
released from the necessity of being doers of the Word. But this is
the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which Christ so unsparingly
condemned in the book of Revelation.
