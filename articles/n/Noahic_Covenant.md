The **Noahic (No-a'-ic) covenant** is the
[covenant](Covenant "Covenant") that [God](God "God") made with
Noah after he left the [ark](Noah's_Ark "Noah's Ark"), sealed with
a rainbow, that He would never again destroy the earth with a flood
(Genesis 8:1 - 9:17).

**8** God said to Noah and his sons, **9** "Look! I now confirm my
covenant with you and your descendants after you **10** and with
every living creature that is with you, including the birds, the
domestic animals, and every living creature of the earth with you,
all those that came out of the ark with you--every living creature
of the earth. **11** I confirm my covenant with you: Never again
will all living things be wiped out by the waters of a flood; never
again will a flood destroy the earth." (Gen. 9:8-11, NET)
This covenant will remain until the earth has passed away (Gen
8:22). This is a perpetual covenant between God and Humankind given
through Noah (Gen 9:17).

## Provisions of the Noahic covenant

-   Man's responsibility to populate the earth is reaffirmed (Gen
    9:1, 7).
-   The subjection of the animal kingdom to man is reaffirmed, but
    now it will be administered under a new relationship. Whereas
    previously man and animal coexisted in peace and animals most
    likely fully cooperated with manâ€™s care and maintenance, now the
    animal kingdom would fear man and be dominated by him (Gen 9:2).
-   Man is permitted to eat the flesh of every "moving creature"
    outside the realm of man. It is suggested that initially man was a
    vegetarian but after the curse of the Flood, man's allowable diet
    was expanded to include the animal kingdom (meat) -- which involved
    killing an animal. The only exception, which is in fact carried
    over into the New Covenant, is that man is to refrain from eating
    blood, the "life of the flesh" (Gen 9:3, 4).
-   The sacredness of human life is established. Since man is made
    in the image of God, one who commits murder shows not only contempt
    for man but also contempt for God (Gen 9:5).
-   Whatever sheds man's blood, whether man or beast, must be put
    to death. This is seen as the institution of human self-government
    (Gen 9:6).
-   The covenant is confirmed with Noah, his sons, their
    descendants, all the animals on the ark and their descendants (Gen
    9:8-10).
-   The earth will never again be destroyed by a universal flood
    (Gen 9:11). The next time God destroys the earth, the means will be
    fire (2 Peter 3:10).
-   The rainbow is established as a sign of the Noahic Covenant to
    both God and man signifying that God will never again destroy the
    earth by a universal flood (Gen 9:12-17).
