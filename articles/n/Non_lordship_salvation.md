**Non-lordship salvation** is a neutral term for
**easy believism**, the "popular slogan for the view that one
simply has to *believe* in order to be saved and that there is no
corresponding need for a committed life of Christian
[discipleship](Discipleship "Discipleship")."^[[1]](#note-0)^ The
result is that the idea of personal
[sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification") is divorced from
[justification](Justification "Justification"), and discipleship is
seen as a path that some Christians follow, but not others. The
term
[carnal Christian](index.php?title=Carnal_Christian&action=edit&redlink=1 "Carnal Christian (page does not exist)")
is used to describe such a supposed Christian, who once made a
"decision" but has not continued in discipleship. Names applied to
this doctrine by opponents include **no-lordship** and
**cheap grace** as it suggests that "accepting Jesus" does not
involve any further commitments. Proponents of this view, on the
other hand, prefer the term the "free grace" to describe their
position. Easy-believism is also said to overemphasize the doctrine
of [assurance](Assurance "Assurance") of salvation at the expense
of personal authenticity.

Those who hold to the Free-grace position are generally
[Arminian](Arminian "Arminian") in theology, although classical
Arminianism does not adhere to this. By contrast, Reformed
Christians generally hold to what is termed
[Lordship salvation](Lordship_salvation "Lordship salvation").
However, among adherents of each view one will find there are
differences of language and emphasis.

According to Phillip Johnson:

"These days, support for the no-lordship gospel is mostly confined
to a small but prolific group of speakers and writers. Dallas is
still the geographical hub of their movement. The Grace Evangelical
Society has published their journal since 1988. In fact, for the
past 15 years or so, GES has almost singlehandedly kept the
drumbeat alive for the no-lordship position."^[[2]](#note-1)^
John MacArthur notes that, "Apparently, no-lordship doctrine no
longer dominates Dallas Seminary the way it once did, but
controversy over the issue is by no means dead."^[[3]](#note-2)^

## Distinctions between Reformed theology and easy believism

As a foreword, it is important to understand how language is used.
Both sides in the debate accept that it may be that the use of
language is causing misunderstandings. The word *necessary* is
contested with particular bitterness. For instance, the (Reformed)
claim "repentance is a necessary condition of salvation" is simply
stating that "everyone who is being saved repents". The
misunderstanding could arise in that "repentance is a necessary
condition of salvation" could be thought to mean "repentance causes
someone to be saved". The necessariness of repentance arises in
that it *always* follows regeneration, and *always* accompanies
salvation.

### Faith and repentance

At the level of the understanding of [faith](Faith "Faith") and
[repentance](Repentance "Repentance"), there are distinct
differences between the "free grace" and "lordship" views.

"Free grace" advocates suggest that faith is a one-time decision, a
mental assent to the bare facts about Christ.^[[4]](#note-3)^ In so
doing, the "free grace" view sounds very much like
[Sandemanianism](Sandemanianism "Sandemanianism"), a rationalist
approach to faith which was arose in eighteenth-century Scotland.
The Reformed insist that faith is a continued, lively trust in the
promises of God. Furthermore, adherents to the "free grace"
position claim that Scripture's teaching is that faith is not a
gift of God ^[[5]](#note-4)^ but is the responsibility of
unregenerate man. By contrast, Reformed Christians believe that
faith is the free gift of God, worked in the heart by the agency of
the Holy Spirit (Heidelberg Catechism 21). In short, the Reformed
position is that faith is not a decision, but an attitude; not a
work, but a gift.

Repentance, likewise, is frequently defined in the "free grace"
position as a simple change of mind as regards the things of God.
In this mode, it sustains its similarities with Sandemanianism.
Other advocates say repentance is an "internal resolve to turn from
one's sins"
([[1]](http://www.faithalone.org/journal/1998i/Anderson.html)), but
that it is not an inevitable consequence of regeneration. By
contrast, the lordship view recognises that repentance is an
about-turn involving the whole person, flowing out of regeneration
and true faith; and that since repentance can never be complete and
perfect, it is continual. To Reformed Christians, repentance is not
an event, but a way of life (95 Theses 1).

### Sanctification and obedience

Advocates of "free grace" suggest that while people can be saved
who are not obedient, they cannot please God or grow in the
Christian life
([[2]](http://faithalone.org/news/y1993/93nov2.html)). Those who
are obedient, though, will please God and grow. They draw a
distinction between *entering* the kingdom and *inheriting* it, so
that someone can enter the kingdom and yet not inherit it, so that
they forego privileges and rewards in the eternal state. The
presentation of the "free grace" position on this matter is akin to
a strict works principle: we work, and God rewards.

Reformed Christians, however, believe something markedly different.
They start from the position that good works are God's gift to
believers; therefore, a Christian cannot point to those works in
order to feel confident in himself, nor can he feel pride at how
well he has done. In any good done, the Reformed acknowledge that
"we are unworthy servants, who have only done our duty".
Furthermore, they also confess that not only our persons, but also
our works are presented in Christ, since apart from him, those
works are tainted with that sinfulness which seeks always to work
for merit. Therefore, the rewards which God promises for good works
are simply the addition of grace to grace. On the question of the
kingdom, entry and inheritance are seen as the same concept, since
one who has entered the kingdom is made a true child of God, and
all true children of God inherit the kingdom. Finally, obedience
and good works are not optional, but are the inevitable fruit of
true faith in Christ.

### Perseverance and assurance

The "free grace" position on the
[perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints")
is a rigorously-applied version of the tag "once saved, always
saved". They teach that by once believing that Jesus is able to
save, a person is eternally secure, so that someone who claims such
a faith, and later places his trust in something other than Jesus,
will nonetheless be saved from sin and death and hell, on the basis
of this one-time "faith".
[[3]](http://www.faithalone.org/news/y2006/wilkin1.html)
[Assurance](Assurance "Assurance") is then thought to be total
certainty, since those who have an intellectual persuasion of the
truth of the gospel but are not personally committed to the Saviour
will be saved. The only source of assurance is a positive response
to the question "do you believe, or have you ever believed, that
Jesus Christ is able to save sinners?" Such faith, of course, is
thought in the "free grace" paradigm to have its origin in the
individual and not with God.

The Reformed view, however, is different. On the matter of the
security of the believer, Reformed theologians teach that the
believer is not only secure eternally, but also temporally; that is
to say, that although believers may have times of difficulty and
doubt, yet they will be kept by God's power and strength so that
difficulty will not overwhelm them, nor will doubt destroy their
faith. Therefore, it is not possible for someone who truly trusts
in Jesus for their salvation then to turn away from him and place
their trust in something else, nor to forsake following him and
choose to live the way they want to. In such a person, the Reformed
Christian would say, true faith had never been worked to start
with; that although such an individual demonstrated external signs
of conversion, they did not place their whole trust in Jesus.

When it comes to assurance, the distinction is slightly more
subtle. Since the "free grace" advocate has already made obedience
an optional extra for the Christian, he denies that the doubter is
able to look at his pattern of living in any sense and simply bases
assurance in the doubter's faith. The Reformed position on
assurance, however, stems from the corresponding understanding of
obedience and works as being among God's gifts to the believer.
Consequently, assurance comes from a number of sources: the
promises of God, particularly as evidenced in the sacraments; the
actions of God, as seen in Christ on the cross; and the work of God
in the life of the believer, including faith, repentance and
obedience. The doubter is then directed to look to Christ in word,
sacrament and internal witness.

## Departures from classical Arminianism

Both classical [Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism") and
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") held to the
[necessity of endurance](Necessity_of_endurance "Necessity of endurance").
Easy believism, on the other hand, rejects the notion that
perseverance (continuing in the faith) is necessary.
