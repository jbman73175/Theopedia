**Nonconformist** was a term used in England after the Act of
Uniformity 1662 to refer to an English subject who separated
himself from the established state
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England"). It may
also refer more narrowly to such a person who also advocated
religious liberty.

The term was applied to early English
[Protestants](Protestantism "Protestantism") (such as
[Puritans](Puritans "Puritans") and
[Presbyterians](Presbyterian "Presbyterian")) who violated the Act
of Uniformity 1559, typically by practicing or advocating radical,
sometimes separatist, dissent with respect to the established state
church.

Presbyterians, Congregationalists, [Baptists](Baptists "Baptists"),
and those less organized, were considered Nonconformists at the
time of the 1662 Act of Uniformity.

The term "dissenter" came into use particularly after the Act of
Toleration (1689), which exempted nonconformists who had taken the
oaths of allegiance from penalties for nonattendance at the
services of the Church of England.
