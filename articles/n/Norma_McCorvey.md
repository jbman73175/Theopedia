**Norma L. McCorvey** (b. 1947) is best known as "Jane Roe" in the
landmark Roe v. Wade lawsuit in which a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court
ruling recognized [abortion](Abortion "Abortion") as a
constitutional right, overturning individual states' laws against
abortion.

McCorvey initially claimed she had been raped, but later admitted
she had become pregnant due to birth control failure. She now
claims she became the "pawn" of two young and ambitious lawyers who
were looking for a plaintiff with whom they could use to challenge
the Texas state law prohibiting abortion.

In 1995, McCorvey quit her job at a Dallas women's clinic, joined a
church pastored by a leader of Operation Rescue, and has since
become an advocate of the pro-life movement, fighting to make
abortion illegal.
