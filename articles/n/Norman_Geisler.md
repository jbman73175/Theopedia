## Theology

Geisler maintains that he is a "moderate Calvinist," as outlined in
his book *Chosen But Free* (1999).

He is widely considered a conservative
[evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism"), in spite of the
misgivings that both Arminian and Calvinist polemicists have with
his "moderate Calvinism". He rejects the classical Calvinist tenets
of
[unconditional election](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election"),
[limited atonement](Limited_atonement "Limited atonement") and
[irresistible grace](Irresistible_grace "Irresistible grace"), yet
retains modified versions of
[total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity") and
[perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints").
In response to this
[James R. White](James_R._White "James R. White"), a
[Calvinist](Calvinist "Calvinist") pastor and apologist, wrote
*The Potter's Freedom* (2000). One of White's contentions is that
Geisler's "moderate Calvinism" appears to be an "inconsistent"
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"), in opposition to the more
robust views espoused by John Calvin.

Dr. Geisler has also been an outspoken critic of "open theism",
especially it's doctrine of "limited foreknowledge", which he
maintains is a deeply flawed subversion of "classical theism." And
while his own views are akin to Thomism in approach, especially in
*Thomas Aquinas: An Evangelical Appraisal* (1991 Baker), he
adamantly rejects Aquinas' Catholic Sacramentalism, the Papacy,
Monasticism, veneration of Saints and Purgatory.
