Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or
imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him
be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all
generations, for ever and ever! Amen. (Ephesians3:20 - 21
[NIV](New_International_Version "New International Version") )
