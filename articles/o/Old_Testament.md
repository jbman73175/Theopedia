The **Old Testament** either refers to the 39 canonical books of
the Hebrew [Scriptures](Bible "Bible") written prior to the
[coming of Christ](First_advent "First advent"), or to the time
period before Christ came, when God's people belonged to the
[nation of Israel](Israel "Israel"). A better translation for "Old
Testament" would probably be "Old Covenant", while some also prefer
"First Testament."

## Books of the Old Testament

### Pentateuch

The Pentateuch was written by [Moses](Moses "Moses") after the
[Exodus](Exodus "Exodus"). Its
[revelation of God](Revelation_of_God "Revelation of God") by means
of the
[history](index.php?title=History_of_Israel&action=edit&redlink=1 "History of Israel (page does not exist)")
and
[regulations](index.php?title=The_Law&action=edit&redlink=1 "The Law (page does not exist)")
of early Israel forms a foundation for the rest of the Bible.

*See main page: [Pentateuch](Pentateuch "Pentateuch")*
-   [Genesis](Genesis "Genesis")
-   [Exodus](Exodus "Exodus")
-   [Leviticus](Leviticus "Leviticus")
-   [Numbers](Book_of_Numbers "Book of Numbers")
-   [Deuteronomy](Deuteronomy "Deuteronomy")

### Historical books

The Historical Books were written by numerous authors, some
unknown. They chronicle the goodness and long-suffering of God to
Israel amidst Israel's repeated and worsening failures. The
historical books are not written as a scientific textbook of
history, although they are absolutely historically accurate; they
focus on individual characters of importance to the rise and fall
of Israel, especially the true, covenanted God
[Jehovah](index.php?title=Jehovah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jehovah (page does not exist)")
(more accurately transliterated Yahweh). Of immense significance to
Israel's history is the [covenant](Covenant "Covenant") made with
[David](David "David") the king, recorded in 2 Samuel
7^[[1]](#note-0)^.

-   [Nehemiah](Book_of_Nehemiah "Book of Nehemiah")
-   [Esther](Book_of_Esther "Book of Esther")

### Poetical books

The poetical books describe wisdom and worship in the days of
Israel. There is much poetry in other books of Scripture——indeed,
the prophet
[Haggai](index.php?title=Haggai&action=edit&redlink=1 "Haggai (page does not exist)")
stands almost alone among the prophets as not containing any
poetry. However, the books of poetry are either composed entirely
of poetry or contain immense sections of poetry. Some would include
the
[Book of Lamentations](Book_of_Lamentations "Book of Lamentations")
with the books of poetry since this book is entirely composed of
poetry.

### Prophets

The prophets applied the Pentateuch to the daily lives of the
people, in particular revealing how blessing or destruction would
come to God's people as a reward for their obedience/disobedience.

## Historicity of the Old Testament

The study of the historicity of the Old Testament seeks to
establish the historical trustworthiness of the Old Testament. This
is based on two factors: the reliability of the Old Testament
manuscripts, and the reliability of those who were involved with
writing and putting the OT together.

*See main article: [Historicity of the Old Testament](Historicity_of_the_Old_Testament "Historicity of the Old Testament")*
## Relationship with surrounding ancient cultures

G. K. Beale writes,

"[T]he Old Testament describes the cosmos in various ways and that
there are three possible interpretations of these descriptions: (1)
they are phenomenological, i.e., what appears to the naked eye; (2)
they are mythological, that is, borrowed from ANE [Ancient Near
Eastern] mythologies about the cosmos; (3) they are theological in
that many of the descriptions portray the universe as part of a big
temple in which God dwells."^[[2]](#note-1)^
Beale rejects the second of the three, and later writes,

"There are, at least, five different ways that the conceptions and
literature of the ancient cultures around Israel relate to the Old
Testament writers, including the ancient pagan conceptions of
temples that do, in fact, exhibit parallels with descriptions of
Israel's temple. (1) The presence of similarities to ANE myth are
sometimes due to polemical intentions or to direct repudiation of
pagan religious beliefs and practices. (2) Others are due to a
reflection of general revelation by both pagan and biblical
writers, and only rightly interpreted by the latter; the
recognition of a cultural bridge does not rule out the providential
activity of God within those cultures.
"3) In addition, still others have attributed purported ANE
mythical parallels in the Old Testament to a common reflection of
ancient tradition, the sources of which precede both the pagan and
biblical writers, and the historicity of which has no independent
human verification, like creation in Genesis 1. Ultimately the
parallels spring from an earlier, ancient, divinely pristine
revelation that became garbled in the pagan context but was
reliably witnessed to by the scriptural writer.
"4) Another view is that revelation did not always counter ancient
Near Eastern concepts but often used them in productive ways,
though still revised in a significant manner by special revelation.
Ancient Near Eastern concepts may have contributed to the theology
of sacred space in the building of Israel’s tabernacle and temple.
Examples include the eastward orientation, the placement of
important cultic objects, the designation of areas of increasing
holiness, and the rules for access to the Holy Place and Holy of
Holies. Accordingly, God often used existing institutions and
transformed them to his theological purposes, for example,
circumcision and sacrificial offerings, though these examples could
also be given for categories 2 and 3 above.
"In all four categories, it is common to find similarities at the
surface but differences at the conceptual level, and vice versa,
especially as divine revelation comes into play in producing
different understandings of these surface-level
differences."^[[3]](#note-2)^
