*"Where can I go from your Spirit? Or where can I flee from your presence? If I ascend into heaven, you are there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there; if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me. If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,” even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you." (Psalm 139:7-12)*
"This is not to say that God’s form is spread out so that parts of
Him exist in every location. God is spirit; He has no physical
form. He is present everywhere in that everything is immediately in
His presence. At the same time He is present everywhere in the
universe. No one can hide from Him and nothing escapes His notice."
