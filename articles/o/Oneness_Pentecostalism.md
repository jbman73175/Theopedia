## Beliefs

### Godhead

One of the two most distinguishing beliefs and practices within
Oneness Pentecostalism (along with Jesus Only baptism — see below)
is [modalism](Modalism "Modalism"). Oneness Pentecostals deny the
Trinity, believing instead that the monotheistic God simply
"manifests" Himself in the offices or roles of the members of the
Trinity. For example, one statement of Oneness beliefs claims:

God is absolutely one, with no distinction of persons. (Deuteronomy
6:4; Isaiah 44:8; 45:5-6, 21-23; 46:9 Romans 3:30; Galatians 3:20;
James 2:19). In order to save sinful humanity, God provided a
sinless Man as a sacrifice of atonement — Jesus Christ, the Son of
God. In begetting the Son and in relating to humanity, God is the
Father. In working to transform and empower human lives, God is the
Holy Spirit. Thus, for our salvation, God has revealed Himself as
Father (in parental relationship to humanity), in His Son (in human
flesh), and as the Holy Spirit (in spiritual action). (Malachi
2:10; Luke 1:35; 2 Corinthians 3:17-18; 1 Timothy 2:5).
