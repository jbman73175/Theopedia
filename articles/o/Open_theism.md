**Open theism**, also called *free will theism* and
*openness theology*, is the belief that [God](God "God") does not
exercise meticulous control of the universe but leaves it "open"
for humans to make significant choices
([free will](Free_will "Free will")) that impact their
relationships with God and others. A corollary of this is that God
has not predetermined the future. Open Theists further believe that
this would imply that God does not
[know the future](Omniscience_of_God "Omniscience of God")
exhaustively. Proponents affirm that God is omniscient, but deny
that this means that God knows everything that will happen.

*"Our rejection of divine timelessness and our affirmation of dynamic omniscience are the most controversial elements in our proposal and the view of foreknowledge receives the most attention. However the watershed issue in the debate is not whether God has exhaustive definite foreknowledge (EDF) but whether God is ever affected by and responds to what we do. This is the same watershed that divides Calvinism from Arminianism"*^[[1]](#note-0)^
Open Theists argue that people are created to be in meaningful
relationships with God and others and as moral beings must have the
ability to make real, responsible choices in their lives. Open
Theists argue that this cannot be accomplished as long as God
exercises exhaustive control of the universe or predetermines the
future because this would remove humanity's free will. The counter
point to this is that critics of Open Theism say that if God is not
exercising meticulous control of the universe, or does not
exhaustively know the future, then this would imply that He is not
in control and we are not able to completely trust in God's
sovereignty. Furthermore, the question remains, will God actually
be able to triumph over evil? Open Theists answer these critiques
by noting that while God does not exercise meticulous control, he
is "ultimately" in control.

There are two primary motivations for Open Theism. The first is to
express a relationship with God that Christians experience
devotional. God, Open Theism says, because He desires relationship,
has given us real freedom to respond to Him relationally
^[[2]](#note-1)^. Secondly, Open Theism focuses on the issue of
[theodicy](Theodicy "Theodicy"). In this Open Theists claim that
God's omnipotence does not mean that He is the author of every
evil, but that God will ultimately triumph over evil.

## Basic beliefs

Open Theists believe that God seeks to be in a reciprocal
relationship with mankind. Because of this, God does not exercise
"meticulous control" of the universe, but leaves it "open" for
mankind to make significant choices (freewill) that impact their
relationships with Him and others. They argue that this is both
what the Scripture says about God, and is the experience of
Christians. People pray expecting that God will answer their
prayers not that the outcome was predetermined and therefore
meaningless to pray. Therefore Open Theists argue that Christians
in practice treat God as if He will respond to them and act
themselves as if their moral choices are real and have real
impact.

Open Theists argue that the belief in meticulous control is not
based on the Bible but instead on Greek/Hellenistic Philosophical
ideas of what they imagines a God must be like. Rather than seeing
the passion and intimacy of a relational God both in the Old and
New Testaments who is concerned with justice, holiness, and love
and intimately involved with His creation - the Greek Philosophers
viewed God as a immovable detached All-Controlling force. This
view, Open Theists argue, influenced later Christian thought. Open
Theists argue that in contrast with this detached view of God as
the "unmoved mover" that the Prophets who pictures God as grieving
over Israel, as well as of the Incarnation which shows God being
intimately involved in the lives of his creation.

The conflict with Open Theism comes from proponents wanting to
stress that God desires to be in a relationship with us and involve
himself, to take risks, to "open" Himself up to that. As seen in
the following section, critics of Open Theism on the other hand
invariably do not object to this so much as they do to the
implication that God may not exercise meticulous control or may not
exhaustively know the future which becomes the central focus of
their criticism.

## Critique

### Libertarian free will

One can understand
[libertarian freedom](Libertarian_freedom "Libertarian freedom")
according to such: "Given choices A and B, one can literally choose
to do either one. No circumstances exist that are sufficient to
determine one's choice; a person's choice is up to him, and if he
does one of them, he could have done otherwise, or at least he
could have refrained from acting at all" (Moreland and Craig,
*Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview*, p. 240).
Hasker takes us a little further: "Notice that the definition
claims that free actions have no *sufficient* cause, not that they
lack causes and conditions altogether. ^[[4]](#note-3)^

"Probably the most common definition says free will is the ability
to make choices without any prior prejudice, inclination, or
disposition."^[[5]](#note-4)^

### God does not know the future exhaustively

Open theism generally begins from the assumption that there are no
truths about future contingents. A contingent truth is something
that is true but didn't have to be. A contingent falsehood is
something that is false but could have been true if things had been
different. Contingent truths about the future are truths about what
will happen that aren't necessary truths. Just as there are truths
about the past that didn't have to be true, most philosophers take
there to be truths about the future that are indeed true but didn't
have to be true. Things could have gone differently in the process
of what will lead up to them. As it happens, or rather as it will
happen, that's not the path things will take. So there are truths
about what we will do that aren't necessary truths but are rather
contingent truths. This is the standard view among philosophers
about future contingents.

Open theism revises this view in one way. It accepts the
possibility that things could go one way or the other in the
future, as the standard view does. It allows that there are some
necessary truths about the future. It accepts that there are
contingent things about the future. It just won't allow those
contingent things to be true or false. If it's not necessary, they
say, it must not be true either, even though truth is much weaker
than necessity. Something can be true but not necessary. But for
open theists, nothing about the future can be true but not
necessary. The future is special somehow.

That forms the basis of the open theist's argument against
foreknowledge. Once you deny that statements about future
contingents can be true or false, then there simply are no truths
about what free creatures will do unless those actions are
necessary. There are no truths about my future except what's true
of me in every possible future. With a robust sense of libertarian
free will, many of our actions are free and thus could have been
otherwise. Therefore, there are very few truths about my future. If
there aren't such truths to know, then God cannot know them.
Therefore, God only knows a very few truths about the future,
things that are true in every possible future.

Open theists claim they do not deny God's omniscience, just God's
foreknowledge. The argumentation appears as such: Just as it
doesn't threaten God's omnipotence to deny that God can make a
contradiction true (because omnipotence only means being able to do
anything possible), it doesn't threaten God's omniscience if his
knowledge is limited to what's true (because omniscience only means
knowing everything true). This is not the kind of exhaustive
knowledge that most theists believe in, but technically-speaking it
is still omniscience. It's just that much of what traditional
theists have considered to be included in omniscience isn't even
true and thus isn't available for God to know.

### Implications for the doctrine of God

Open theism's beliefs concerning the foreknowledge of God implies
many things about the character of God. God literally changes his
mind, continues to learn, and is even said to take risks (hence
John Sanders' book *The God Who Risks*).
[Gregory Boyd](Gregory_Boyd "Gregory Boyd"), an open theist, notes
that "In a cosmos populated by free agents, the outcome of things
-- even divine decisions -- is often uncertain." ^[[6]](#note-5)^.
He states in another place that "God's call to covenantal
faithfulness has involved testing. God is seeking to find out
whether or not the people he calls will lovingly choose him above
all else." ^[[7]](#note-6)^

### Implications for the Christian life

Gregory Boyd assures readers that according to Open Theism
*there is no assurance*:

"It is true that according to the open view things can happen in
our lives that God didn't plan or even foreknow with certainty
(though he always foreknew they were possible). This means that in
the open view things can happen to us that have no overarching
divine purpose. In this view, "trusting in God" provides no
assurance that everything that happens to us will reflect his
divine purposes, for there are other agents who also have power to
affect us, just as we have power to affect others. This, it must be
admitted, can for some be a scary thought." ^[[8]](#note-7)^
### Interpretive methods

The open theist generally applies a very literal interpretation of
scripture, at least when it comes to passages about God's
engagement with people in time. For instance, when it says that God
relents or changes his mind, this is taken literally. The
traditional view is that such statements are told from within the
perspective of time as experienced by humans. Particularly if God
is outside time, it can't mean what the open theist takes it to
mean. Even if God knows what he will do in the future, as some more
limited open theists would say (still leaving open what people will
choose to do), God doesn't change his own mind, not literally.

On the other hand, open theists cannot take too literally any
passage that speaks of God not changing his mind as humans do or
any statements about God knowing all of our days from before we
even existed. Since taking both statements literally would lead to
a contradiction, open theists opt to go with the literal reading of
the statements about human experience of God in narratives, while
traditional theists emphasize the literal meaning of direct
prophecies from God or statements in the psalms. Either view has to
resolve the conflict, and each favors one variety of statement as
non-literal or less literal. Open theists see the narrative
statements as straightforward telling of what God does, while the
prophecies and psalms are poetry, which often contains metaphor and
exaggeration. On the other hand, traditional theists see the
narrative statements as told from a human perspective due to their
being recountings of human interactions with God in time, and if
God doesn't experience those interactions the same way due to
having a plan for how it would turn out, it's not surprising for it
to read the way it does. Furthermore, they see the psalmic and
prophetic statements as direct revelation, and most such statements
are not metaphor, even if they are often expressed in poetic form.
Not all such statements are poetic, either, because the prophet
Samuel delivers a statement to Saul that God does not change his
mind (and this in a passage that explicitly declares God to have
changed his mind in the narrative portion).

## Popular proponents

### Gregory Boyd

*See main page: [Gregory Boyd](Gregory_Boyd "Gregory Boyd")*
### John Sanders

"The overarching structures of creation are purposed by God, but
not every single detail that occurs within them. Within general
providence it makes sense to say that God intends an overall
purpose for the creation and that God does not specifically intend
each and every action within the creation. Thus God does not have a
specific divine purpose for each and every occurrence of evil. The
"greater good" of establishing the conditions of fellowship between
God and creatures does not mean that gratuitous evil has a point.
Rather, the possibility of gratuitous evil has a point but its
actuality does not. ... When a two-month-old child contracts a
painful, incurable bone cancer that means suffering and death, it
is pointless evil. The Holocaust is pointless evil. .. God does not
have a specific purpose in mind of these occurrences."

### Bob Enyart

The pastor of Denver Bible Church has debated
[Knox Theological Seminary](Knox_Theological_Seminary "Knox Theological Seminary")'s
Associate Professor of New Testament, Sam Lamerson, on Open Theism,
moderated, in
[ten rounds online](http://www.theologyonline.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21711).
Also a Christian radio talk show host for 17 years, Bob Enyart has
produced a
[3 DVD Seminar](http://www.kgovstore.com/servlet/Detail?no=61) on
Open Theism, a first of its kind.

"The future is open because God is free and God is creative. The
settled view of God denies God's own freedom and the ability to
create, do something new, etc. God was, is and always will be free.
God was, is and always will be a creative God." ^[[10]](#note-9)^

## Taking Open Theism seriously

"If 'reformists' insist on keeping the boundaries of heresy open,
however, then they must be resisted with charity. The fantasy that
God is ignorant of the future is a heresy that must be rejected on
scriptural grounds ('I make known the end from the beginning, from
ancient times, what is still to come'; Isa. 46:10a; cf. Job 28; Ps.
90; Rom. 8:29; Eph. 1), as it has been in the history of the
exegesis of relevant passages. This issue was thoroughly discussed
by patristic exegetes as early as Origen's Against Celsus. Keeping
the boundaries of faith undefined is a demonic temptation that
evangelicals within the mainline have learned all too well and have
been burned by all too painfully."^[[11]](#note-10)^
