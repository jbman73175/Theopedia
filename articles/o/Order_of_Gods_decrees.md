-   **Order of God's decrees**

The **order of [God](God "God")'s decrees**, according to the
[Westminster Shorter Catechism](Westminster_Shorter_Catechism "Westminster Shorter Catechism"),
is "...His eternal purpose, according to the counsel of His will,
whereby, for His own glory, He has fore-ordained whatsoever comes
to pass." In discussing the order of decrees, we are referring to
the logical relationship of the various aspects of God's one
eternal purpose regarding the creation, predestination and
salvation of man. The primary interest in the decrees of God
usually relates to the understanding of divine
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination") or divine
[election](Election "Election") and its place in God's plan of
redemption.

A discussion of the logical relation of divine decrees is valuable
because it helps clarify and distinguish various theological
positions regarding God's plan of redemption. It is especially
helpful in understanding the differences between
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"),
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"), and
[Pelagianism](Pelagianism "Pelagianism"), as well as the variations
thereof.

First, it should be emphasized that the decrees of God are
understood as one single eternal intention; not an order of
succession in His plan either in time or deliberation. As
[A. A. Hodge](A._A._Hodge "A. A. Hodge") has stated, "The question
as to the Order of Decrees is not a question as to the order of
acts in God decreeing, but it is a question as to the true relation
sustained by the several parts of the system which He decrees to
one another," (*Outlines*, p. 230). In other words, it has to do
with the logical relationship between creation, predestination, and
redemption established by the eternal purpose of God?

The chart below presents five selected schemes and their respective
differences regarding the order of decrees, (adapted from *Plan*,
p. 23). The subsequent discussion will proceed from right to left,
beginning with the Pelagian view.

## Pelagian view

This view is basically a *naturalistic* view of
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") as opposed to a
supernaturalistic view. The primary issue between the naturalist
and the supernaturalist may be summed up in one question: Does man
save himself or does God save him? In its purity,
[Pelagianism](Pelagianism "Pelagianism") affirms that all the power
exerted in saving man is native to man himself. It is basically a
salvation by works mentality that continues to show up in various
forms today.

Pelagianism denies that human nature has been corrupted by sin, and
hence maintains that every infant comes into the world in the same
condition as Adam before [the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall"). Man thus
has a free will and the ability to justify himself before God.
[St. Augustine](St._Augustine "St. Augustine") was successful in
having Pelagianism condemned by the church at the
[council of Ephesus](Council_of_Ephesus "Council of Ephesus") in
the year 431.

## Semi-Pelagian view

[Semi-Pelagianism](Semi-Pelagianism "Semi-Pelagianism") is only a
mild improvement over blatant Pelagianism. Like Pelagianism, it is
a *naturalistic* view of salvation that has man saving himself with
God's help. According to this view, man is not by nature
[totally depraved](Total_depravity "Total depravity"), but does
suffer a physical and moral deterioration resulting from the Fall.
In this view, man has retained his natural free will and the
ability to improve on the grace God has provided to all.

Like Pelagianism before it, Semi-Pelagianism was condemned at the
[Council of Orange](Council_of_Orange "Council of Orange") in 529
in favor of a moderate Augustinian view. Even though the
sovereignty of God's grace in salvation was upheld by
Augustinianism to this point, compromises made at the Synod of
Orange left an incipient semi-Pelagianism which was eventually
revived and accepted by the church at large during the middle
ages.

## Arminian view

Biblical Christianity was revived in the 16th century
[Protestant Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation").
However, it didn't take long after the Reformation for some of the
same theological issues that Augustine faced to resurface, e.g. the
sovereign grace of God versus the free will of man. This is not
surprising since variations of free will Semi-Pelagianism had
become the accepted position of both the Eastern and Roman
churches.

At the [Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort"), 1618–1619,
the Reformed churches of the day officially condemned what was
perceived as the revived Semi-Pelagianism of the Dutch Remonstrants
in favor of a strict Calvinistic position as expressed in the
Belgic and Helvetic Confessions. Although officially rejected, this
view continued to exist and grow in the Protestant churches under
the name of [Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism") from
[Jacob Arminius](Jacob_Arminius "Jacob Arminius"), 1560–1609, whose
teaching formed the basis of the
[Remonstrants](Five_articles_of_Remonstrance "Five articles of Remonstrance")'
position.

Arminianism sees itself as a fundamental improvement over the
Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian views in that it is *supernaturalistic*,
attributing the primary work of salvation to God at all points.
However, it maintains that by virtue of God's
[universal prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace")
all men have a free will and the ability to savingly respond to
God. It also maintains that predestination is based on God's divine
foreknowledge, where foreknowledge is erroneously equated with
foresight.

Arminianism is "universalistic" since in its view God does no more
for any man than He does for all. This reduces to the point where
the deciding factor in salvation is in man himself, which thus
approaches Semi-Pelagianism where man saves himself with God's
help. Reformed theologians therefore see a rather gray line that
distinguishes Arminianism from Semi-Pelagianism.

## Amyraldian view

[Amyraldism](Amyraldism "Amyraldism") developed historically
following the Synod of Dort as a compromise between
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") and the early Arminianism by
giving up what was perceived as some of the harshness of Calvinism.
The Amyraldian view, named after French Theologian
[Moses Amyraut](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Amyraut "wikipedia:Moses Amyraut"),
1569-1664, is associated with Calvinism because it retains a
particularistic element by acknowledging God's distinguishing grace
in the [election](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election")
of individuals.

The logic the of Amyraldians, however, places divine election
*after* the decree to provide an
[atonement](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ"). This makes
the atonement *universal* in nature and the application of the
atonement particular in nature through divine election. This view
is sometimes referred to as Four-Point Calvinism since it gives up
the Calvinist doctrine of
[limited atonement](Limited_atonement "Limited atonement") in favor
of a
[universal atonement](Universal_atonement "Universal atonement").
It is also known, perhaps more descriptively, as Hypothetical
Redemptionism. Although Amyraldianism may be a recognizable form of
Calvinism because it retains the principle of particularism in
election, it is not necessarily a good form of Calvinism. According
to [B. B. Warfield](B._B._Warfield "B. B. Warfield"), "it is a
logically inconsistent and therefore unstable form of Calvinism.
For another more important reason, it turns away from a
substitutionary atonement, which is as precious to the Calvinist as
his particularism," (*Plan*, p. 98).

This view maintains that Christ died for all men alike, making all
men savable, with actual salvation conditioned on individual faith.
Then God, seeing that no one would respond because of their
[depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity"), chose (or elected)
some to receive the grace to believe. Some see this as
inconsistent, for how is it possible to contend that God gave His
Son to die for all men alike and equally, and at the same time to
declare that when He gave His Son to die, He already fully intended
that His death should not avail for all men equally, but only for
some which He would select.

Looking now at the chart, the primary characteristic of the
Amyraldian scheme is the placement of election *after* the
atonement. However, opponents contend that Scripture indicates
Christ came in order to execute the purpose of election. He came to
die for and give eternal life to as many as the Father had given
Him. See John 10:15 and 17:2, 9. If this point is true, then the
decree to elect some of mankind should necessarily precede the
decree to provide an atonement. The Amyraldian scheme assumes the
reverse to be true.

## Infralapsarian view

This term comes from the Latin. *Infra* means 'subsequent to' or
'below' and *lapsus* means 'fall'. This pertains to the placement
of divine election in the order of decrees with respect to
[the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall") of man. In the case of
Infralapsarianism, election is logically after the Fall.

Infralapsarianism recognizes that election has to do specifically
with salvation. It maintains that the principle of particularism,
in the sense of distinguishing grace, belongs to the sphere of
God's plan of redemption. Therefore, Infralapsarians place election
at the head of those decrees that look to salvation and subsequent
to the decrees of creation and the Fall. In the order of thought,
election falls subsequent to the decrees of creation and the Fall
because these refer to all men alike, since all men are certainly
created and all men have certainly fallen. Likewise, election falls
prior to the decrees of redemption and its application because it
is just as certain that all men are not redeemed and all men are
not saved.

The Infralapsarian view is that of historic Calvinism (the heart of
Reformed Theology). According to Warfield, this is the only view
that is self consistent and consistent with the facts of
Scripture.

John Calvin said in the final edition of the his Institutes, "No
one who wishes to be thought religious dares simply deny
predestination, by which God adopts some to hope of life, and
sentences others to eternal death. But our opponents, especially
those who make foreknowledge its cause, envelop it in numerous
petty objections. We indeed, place both doctrines in God, but we
say that subjecting one to the other is absurd." Institutes
III.21.5 (Translation Battles & McNeill)

## Supralapsarian view

Supra basically means 'prior to' or 'above'.
[Supralapsarianism](Supralapsarianism "Supralapsarianism") thus
puts God's decree to elect some to eternal life *prior to* His
decree to permit [the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall"). This view is
usually associated with High Calvinism and is sometimes improperly
called [Hyper-Calvinism](Hyper-Calvinism "Hyper-Calvinism"). A
variation of Supralapsarianism places the decree to elect prior
even to the decree to create man. This view thus holds that God's
distinguishing grace is the primary means by which He brings glory
to Himself, and therefore makes it His foremost concern.

The question raised between the Supra- and Infra-lapsarian views
boils down to this: Does God discriminate between men in order to
save some, or does He save some in order to discriminate between
men? Or, as Warfield phrased it: "Is God's motive an abstract
desire for discrimination so that He may have some variety in His
dealings with men?… Or, is the motive that moves Him an
unwillingness that all men should perish in their sins?" (*Plan*,
p.19).

While there have been logical arguments articulated for the
Supra-views, opponents contend there is little scriptural support.
They argue that the language of Scripture indicates the elect are
chosen from a mass of fallen, sinful humanity, not an innocent (or
uncreated) mass. Therefore, election should be viewed as logically
subsequent to the Fall. See also John 15:19 and Romans 11:5–7.
Scripture also declares that the elect are chosen unto
sanctification and to the sprinkling of the blood of Christ. They
must therefore have been regarded as guilty and defiled by sin when
they were chosen. See 1 Pet. 1:2, and Eph. 1:4–6.

## Summary

Calvinists give a predominate place to God's predestination and
election as applied to individual men. Consequently, the doctrine
of
[unconditional election](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election"),
which is typically seen as the trademark of Calvinism, shows up in
the first three columns of the chart. Although the Amyraldian view
is considered a hybrid, nevertheless it is considered a brand of
Calvinism because it does hold to an "unconditional" election.

In looking at the chart as a whole and tracking the doctrine of
unconditional election, it is noted that the placement of election
finds it's highest point in the first column with the
Supralapsarian view, notably *prior* to the Fall of man. In the
second column we have Infralapsarianism, representing a low or
common Calvinist position, where election has moved down a level so
that it now *follows* the decree to permit the Fall. As explained
earlier, this seems to be the most biblical view. In the third
column, Amyraldianism has moved election down another position so
that it now comes after the decree to provide an atonement.

In the next column we see Arminianism, where God's unconditional
election has been replaced with a
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination") where God chose
unto salvation those whom He foresaw would believe of their own
free will. Here the salvation of men is no longer dependent on God
but dependent on man himself. God has done His part, now man must
do his part by believing in Christ of his own
[free will](Free_will "Free will"). Arminianism is perhaps the most
popular scheme in professing Christianity today.

The last two columns represent *naturalistic* views which were
historic predecessors of Arminianism. Here we see no hint of divine
election at all, rather we see God providing salvation to those who
merit it through their own works. Once you leave Amyraldianism,
which still has its own inherent weaknesses, you have God doing no
more for any man than He does for all men. What this means is that
nothing that God and Christ have done can save us unless we add
something to it. According to these views, the determining factor
in [salvation](Salvation "Salvation") is man himself, which is
contrary to Calvinism and the Reformed tradition.
