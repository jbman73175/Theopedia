**Ordo Salutis** is Latin for "the order of salvation" which deals
with the logical sequence of steps or stages involved in the
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") of a believer (e.g. election,
foreknowledge, predestination, redemption, regeneration,
justification, sanctification, glorification - see especially
Romans 8:29-30). There is disagreement within the
[Church](Church "Church") concerning this order, and about the
causal connections between them. Discussion of the *ordo salutis*
necessarily involves specific terms which are listed below with
brief definitions:

[Foreknowledge](Foreknowledge "Foreknowledge"): God's knowing (in
this sense) prior to salvation those who would be saved.
[Predestination](Predestination "Predestination"): God's choosing
before time all who would be saved.
[Election](Election "Election"): God's choosing of all who would be
saved.
[Regeneration](Regeneration "Regeneration"): God's renewing of
one's life (not physically - but as opposed to the spiritual death
caused by sin).
[Evangelism](Evangelism "Evangelism"): The communication of the
Gospel by which one can be saved.
[Faith](Faith "Faith"): Belief and trust in the message of the
Gospel.
[Conversion](Conversion "Conversion"): One's turning to God based
on the Gospel.
[Perseverance](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints"):
One's continued true belief - remaining in the state of salvation.
[Repentance](Repentance "Repentance"): One's turning from sin to
God.
[Justification](Justification "Justification"): God's freeing of
one from the penalty of sin - the pronouncement of "not guilty" on
a sinner.
[Sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification"): God's separation
of one from the lure of sin.
[Glorification](Glorification "Glorification"): God's final removal
of all sin from the life and presence of one (in the eternal
state).
The debate over "ordo salutis" is most keenly evident between the
[Reformed](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology") and
[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") systems. For the Reformed
tradition the "ordo salutis" is: election / predestination,
followed by evangelism, regeneration, conversion, justification,
sanctification, and glorification. For the Arminian view, the "ordo
salutis" is: evangelism, followed by faith / election, repentance,
regeneration, justification, perseverance, and glorification. These
stages may have various distinctions that are not represented here,
but serve to show the basic differences between the two systems. It
should be noted that these need not be conceived as chronological
steps - many of these stages are seen as distinctions within a
single process that all (in one way or another) depend upon the
work of God.

It is important to realize that the differences are much more than
mere labels. One's "ordo salutis" has as much to do with salvation
stages as it does with the cause(s) of salvation itself. For
example, the reformed position has faith as an effect of election
rather than a cause of it (as the Arminians have it). Thus, there
is a sense in which a person is saved in order to have faith.
Where, then, should blame be laid if a person does not believe? The
Arminian position has the believer responsible for whether or not
God saves them, and thus a person must persevere to the end before
they can be assured of salvation. What does this say about a
believer's security? These and many other questions are dependent
upon the "ordo salutis" for their answers, and it is thus important
that a believer understands from which perspective those answers
are given.[[1]](http://www.gotquestions.org/ordo-salutis.html)
