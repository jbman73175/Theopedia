The term **Oriental Orthodox** refers to the churches of
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox") traditions
that keep the faith of only the first three
[ecumenical councils](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils") —
the First Council of Nicaea, the First Council of Constantinople
and the Council of Ephesus — and rejected the dogmatic definitions
of the Council of Chalcedon. Hence, these Churches are also called
*Old Oriental Churches*. Thus, despite potentially confusing
nomenclature, **Oriental Orthodox churches** are distinct from the
churches that collectively refer to themselves as
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox").

The Oriental Orthodox churches resulted from a schism with the
remainder of Christianity in the 5th century. The separation
resulted in part from the Oriental Orthodox churches' refusal to
accept the Christological dogmas of the
[Council of Chalcedon](Council_of_Chalcedon "Council of Chalcedon"),
which held that [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") has two natures — one divine
and one human, although these are inseparable and only act as one
[hypostasis](Hypostatic_union "Hypostatic union"). To the hierarchs
who would lead the Oriental Orthodox, this was tantamount to
accepting [Nestorianism](Nestorianism "Nestorianism"). In response,
they advocated a formula that stressed unity of the Incarnation
over all other considerations. The Oriental Orthodox churches are
therefore often called [Monophysite](Monophysitism "Monophysitism")
churches, although they reject this label, which is associated with
Eutychian [Monophysitism](Monophysitism "Monophysitism"),
preferring the term "non-Chalcedonian" or "Miaphysite" churches.
Oriental Orthodox churches reject the Monophysite teachings of
Eutychus and the Dyophysite teachings of
[Nestorius](Nestorius "Nestorius").

In the 20th century, the Chalcedonian schism is not seen with the
same relevance any more, and from several meetings between the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") Pope John Paul II
and Patriarchs of the Oriental Orthodox churches, reconciling
declarations have begun to emerge.

## Oriental Orthodox Communion

The Oriental Orthodox Communion is a group of churches within
Oriental Orthodoxy which are in "full communion" with each other.
The communion includes:

-   The Armenian Apostolic Church
-   The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria
-   The Ethiopian Orthodox Church (Tewahedo Church)
-   The Eritrean Orthodox Church (Tewahido Church)
-   The Indian Orthodox Church
-   The Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch (also known as the Syrian
    Orthodox Church)

## Assyrian Church of the East

The Assyrian Church of the East is sometimes considered an Oriental
Orthodox Church, although they left the Catholic and Apostolic
Church in reaction against the Council of Ephesus 20 years earlier
and revere Saints anathematized by the previously mentioned
Churches. In addition, they accept a
[Nestorian](Nestorianism "Nestorianism") or Nestorian-like
[Christology](Christology "Christology") that is categorically
rejected by the Oriental Orthodox Communion.
