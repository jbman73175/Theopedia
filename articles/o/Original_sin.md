**Original sin** is the [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") which holds
that [human nature](Nature "Nature") has been morally and ethically
corrupted due to the disobedience of mankind's first parents to the
revealed will of [God](God "God"). In the [Bible](Bible "Bible"),
the first human transgression of God's command is described as the
[sin](Sin "Sin") of Adam and Eve in the
[Garden of Eden](Garden_of_Eden "Garden of Eden") resulting in what
theology calls [the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall") of mankind. The
doctrine of *original sin* holds that every person born into the
world is tainted by the Fall such that all of humanity is ethically
debilitated, and people are powerless to rehabilitate themselves,
unless rescued by God.

    (Quicktime), by [Bruce Ware](Bruce_Ware "Bruce Ware")

There are wide-ranging disagreements among Christian groups as to
the exact understanding of this doctrine, with some so-called
Christian groups denying it altogether.
[Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy"),
[Judaism](Judaism "Judaism"), and [Islam](Islam "Islam")
acknowledge that the introduction of sin into the human race
affected the subsequent environment for mankind, but deny any
inherited guilt or necessary corruption of man's nature.

However, [G. K. Chesterton](G._K._Chesterton "G. K. Chesterton")
once noted that "Certain new theologians dispute original sin,
which is the only part of Christian theology which can really be
proved," (*Orthodoxy*, chap. 2). He saw original sin as the one
Christian doctrine that is empirically verifiable and validated by
3500 years of human history.

## Historical development

It was largely through [Augustine](Augustine "Augustine")'s
arguments against the [Pelagians](Pelagianism "Pelagianism") that
the doctrine of "original sin" was formalized into Christian
[orthodoxy](Orthodox "Orthodox").

## Responsibility?

Some hold that humans are only responsible for conscious acts of
sin:

"We believe that original sin differs from actual sin in that it
constitutes an inherited propensity to actual sin for which no one
is accountable until its divinely provided remedy is neglected or
rejected." [[1]](http://www.nazarene.org/gensec/we_believe.html)
This view maintains that the effects of original sin are "innocent
effects", and that people are only held accountable for "actual
sins" or "personal sins", which are a "voluntary violation[s] of a
known law of God by a morally responsible person."
[[2]](http://www.nazarene.org/gensec/we_believe.html)

## Quotes

-   ". . . all men, born according to nature, are born with sin,
    that is, without the fear of God, without confidence towards God
    and with concupiscence, and that this original disease or flaw is
    truly a sin, bringing condemnation and also eternal death to those
    who are not reborn through baptism and the Holy Spirit" (Article
    II). - Augsburg Confession of Faith (1530)
