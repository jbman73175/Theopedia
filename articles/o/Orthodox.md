The word **orthodox** comes from two Greek words, *ortho* + *doxa*,
meaning "right opinion" or "correct thinking."

In Christianity, it generally means adhering to the accepted or
traditional historic Christian faith. Some see "orthodoxy" as that
which is defined by the early
[ecumenical](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils") creeds
which would include the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, popularly
known in the West as the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed"), that was formally
accepted by the second Council of Constantinople in 381 A.D. The
[Apostles' Creed](Apostles'_Creed "Apostles' Creed") and the
[Athanasian Creed](Athanasian_Creed "Athanasian Creed") are
accepted as ecumenical in the Western Christian confessions, i.e.
the Roman Catholic Church and many Protestant denominations (e.g.
see the Lutheran Book of Concord where all three of these creeds
are given as "ecumenical").

"Orthodoxy" may also be described as the least common denominator
by which an individual, group, or church may legitimately claim the
name "Christian." In this sense, orthodox would refer to
[essential doctrines](Essential_doctrines "Essential doctrines")
defining the essence of Christianity.

As a proper name, **Orthodox** may be used to refer to the
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox") churches
and/or the
[Oriental Orthodox](Oriental_Orthodox "Oriental Orthodox")
churches. It also shows up in some
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") denominations such as the
Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC).
