The **Orthodox Presbyterian Church** (OPC), along with Westminster
Theological Seminary, was founded by conservative
[Presbyterians](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") who revolted against
the modernist theology within the
[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America](Presbyterian_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America "Presbyterian Church in the United States of America")
(PCUSA) during the 1930s. Led by
[J. Gresham Machen](J._Gresham_Machen "J. Gresham Machen"), the
church's goal was to preserve adherence to doctrines of the
historic Westminster Standards and
[Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") theology.

## Background

Machen was one of the chief conservative professors at Princeton
Theological Seminary, which until the early twentieth century was a
bastion of orthodox Presbyterian theology. In 1929, the Board of
the seminary reorganized along more liberal lines, and began hiring
professors who were significantly more friendly towards
[modernism](Modernism "Modernism") and some forms of
[liberalism](Liberalism "Liberalism").

Machen and a group of other conservatives objected to these
changes, forming Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929. Then,
objecting to theological positions that he believed compromised the
distinctives of the Reformed tradition, if not the basic tenets of
Christianity itself, Machen pled his case before the General
Assembly of the PCUSA. The Assembly refused to take action, and so
Machen and several other professors, along with a group of fellow
conservatives, formed the Independent Board for Presbyterian
Foreign Missions.

In 1934, the General Assembly condemned this action and Machen and
his allies were relieved of their positions and effectively thrown
out of the denomination. On June 11, 1936, Machen and a group of
conservative ministers, elders, and laymen met in Philadelphia to
form the Presbyterian Church of America (not to be confused with
the current
[Presbyterian Church in America](Presbyterian_Church_in_America "Presbyterian Church in America")
which organized half a century later). The PCUSA filed suit against
the fledgling denomination for their choice of name, and in 1939
the denomination renamed itself the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.

Early leaders in the denomination included
[Cornelius Van Til](Cornelius_Van_Til "Cornelius Van Til") and
[John Murray](John_Murray "John Murray").
