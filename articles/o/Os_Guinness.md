Os Guinness
**Os Guinness** is a Christian apologist and social analyst who
lives in McLean, Virginia. Born in China during World War II, he
remained there until 1951 when the Communists forced most
foreigners to leave. Educated in England, he did undergraduate
studies at the University of London and postgraduate studies at
University of Oxford, where he graduated with a D.Phil in the
social sciences from Oriel College.

He has written or edited more than twenty books, including
*The American Hour* (Free Press, 1993), *The Call* (Word 1998),
*Time for Truth* (Baker 2000), *Long Journey Home* (Doubleday
2001), and
*Unspeakable: Facing Up to Evil in an Age of Genocide and Terror*
(HarperCollins, 2005).

Guinness is the creative force behind
[The Trinity Forum](http://www.ttf.org/index), a Christian think
tank that came about as the result of a remark by one of Guinness's
mentors. "Peter Berger, one of my mentors in sociology, remarked
that the United States is a nation of Indians ruled by Swedes,"
Guinness notes. "By that he meant that the American people are as
religious as the people of India-the most religious country in the
world-but that American leadership is often as secular as Sweden,
the most secular country in the world. And the tone deafness
between these two groups causes a lot of national friction. The
Trinity Forum was built upon Berger's remark-as well as upon the
historical precedents set by William Wilberforce."

## Quotes

-   "By our uncritical pursuit of relevance we have actually
    courted irrelevance; by our breathless chase after relevance
    without a matching committment to faithfulness, we have become not
    only unfaithful, but irrelevant; by our determined efforts to
    redefine outselves in ways that are more compelling to the modern
    world than are faithful to Christ, we have lost not only our
    identity but our authority and our relevance. Our crying need is to
    be faithful as well as relevant" (*Prophetic Untimeliness*, p.
    15).
