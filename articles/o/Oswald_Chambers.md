Oswald Chambers
**Oswald Chambers** (1874 - 1917) was a preacher, writer, and
evangelist. Born in Aberdeen, Scotland, he was educated in The Art
School in South Kensington, the University of Edinburg, and in
theology in Dunoon Training School, where he became a tutor in
philosophy. From 1906 to 1907, he engaged in a round-the-world
preaching tour among Methodist and Holiness groups.

Chambers worked with the League of Prayer from 1907 to 1910, and
was Principal of the League's Bible Training School from 1911 to
1915. From 1915 to his death in 1917, he served among British
soldiers in Egypt as a YMCA worker. His numerous books are mainly
compilations of his messages--the most popular being
*My Utmost For His Highest*. ^[[2]](#note-1)^

The Reverend Oswald Chambers was an evangelist throughout the
United Kingdom, America and Japan. In 1915 he traveled to Egypt to
work with the YMCA in Zeitoun ministering to soldiers there, and it
was here that he suffered from an attack of appendicitis that
ultimately took his life. Biddy Chambers, Oswald’s wife, took
meticulous notes on his various sermons and talks, and made the
decision to have them published. Her hard work allows us to
experience the wisdom of this great man so many years after his
death. ^[[3]](#note-2)^

Oswald Chambers was a man unbridled by the world and its desires.
Some say he was one of the greatest Christian thinkers of our time.
He would say if any credit is given, let it go to Jesus Christ, his
Lord and Savior. Much like the apostle Paul, life for Oswald
Chambers was but an open opportunity to glorify God.
