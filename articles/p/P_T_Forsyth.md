**Peter Taylor Forsyth** (1848-1921), a Scottish theologian,
graduated from the University of Aberdeen and then studied under
Albrecht Ritschl in Germany. "During successive Congregational
ministries at Shipley, Hackney, Manchester, Leicester, and
Cambridge he shed his early theological liberalism and became a
passionate exponent of an approach in which the cross was the
criterion of truth. In 1901 he became principal of Hackney
Congregational College and in 1905 chairman of the Congregational
Union."^[[1]](#note-0)^
