**Panentheism**, literally "all-in-God-ism", "affirms that although
God and the world are [ontologically](Ontology "Ontology") distinct
[i.e., not the same] and God transcends the world, the world is
'in' God ontologically." ^[[1]](#note-0)^ This is not to be
confused with [pantheism](Pantheism "Pantheism"), which understands
God to *be* the world. For most panentheists, God is intimately
connected to the world and yet remains greater than the world. In
this view, events and changes in the universe affect and change
God, and he is therefore a temporal being. As the universe grows,
God learns as he increases in knowledge and being.

Panentheism has been associated with
[process theology](Process_theology "Process theology") and aspects
of [open theism](Open_theism "Open theism"), including theologians
such as [Paul Tillich](Paul_Tillich "Paul Tillich"),
[Wolfhart Pannenberg](Wolfhart_Pannenberg "Wolfhart Pannenberg"),
[Jurgen Moltmann](Jurgen_Moltmann "Jurgen Moltmann"),
[Robert Jenson](Robert_Jenson "Robert Jenson"), and possibly
[Karl Rahner](Karl_Rahner "Karl Rahner").
