**Pantelism**, is a recent term in Christian
[eschatology](Eschatology "Eschatology") that refers to what some
see as an extension of Full [Preterism](Preterism "Preterism").
This view maintains that the Scriptures both prophetically
*and redemptively*, were entirely fulfilled in the person and work
of Christ and consummated at the destruction of Jerusalem in 70
A.D. Accordingly, this consummation included not only Christ’s
[Second Coming](Second_coming "Second coming"), but the
[final judgment](Final_judgment "Final judgment"), the
[resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection") of the just and the
unjust, and the reconciliation of all things. The unorthodox aspect
of this view is that the reconciliation accomplished in 70 A.D was
such that there no longer remains a lost condition in humanity and
therefore no present need for [conversion](Conversion "Conversion")
-- which reduces to a form of universalism where all are saved and
one must simply realize what has been done for all humanity.

The term *pantelism* (from the Greek “all” and “fulfillment”) was
apparently coined by Jonathan Seraiah, a preterist who has written
against this view.^[[1]](#note-0)^ Seraiah prefers the title
pantelism (over Hyper- or Consistent Preterism) as a neutral term
that does not presuppose that non-pantelist preterists are somehow
“inconsistent.”

According to David Embury, a self-proclaimed pantelist,

"This fulfillment completed all Biblical eschatology, being
demonstrated in Christ and His elect first-fruits saints
end-of-the-age ministry, finding consummation in His prophesied
Second Coming [Parousia] and Judgment upon the Old Covenant Mosaic
world of the Law and Temple, circa AD70.
"Christ's coming in power was never about "the-end-of-the-world" as
we know it, viz., the end of the material time-space universe. Nor
was it ever about the end of the "Christian-age" followed by the
endless utopian bliss of Heaven. No, Christ's Coming, also known as
'the Parousia' was all about the ending of the Mosaic world of the
Law for righteousness, followed by the ageless world of the Gospel
of Grace – our present time Rev 14:6. ^[[2]](#note-1)^
