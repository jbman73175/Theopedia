**Pantheism** comes from two Greek words, *pan* (all) and *theism*
(God) meaning "all is God" or "God is all." It is the belief that
all things contain divinity and that God is the sum of all things.
Pantheism is the view that God is everything and everyone - and
consequently that everyone and everything is God.

Pantheism is the presupposition behind many cults and false
religions, for example Hinduism and Buddhism to an extent, the
various unity and unification cults, mother nature worshippers,
etc. ^[[1]](#note-0)^ The theories of
[Panentheism](Panentheism "Panentheism") and
[Pandeism](index.php?title=Pandeism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pandeism (page does not exist)")
were later developed in an effort to reconcile the conceits of
Pantheism with [Monotheism](Monotheism "Monotheism") and
[Deism](Deism "Deism").^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
