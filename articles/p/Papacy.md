The **Pope** is the Catholic bishop and patriarch of Rome, and the
visible head of the
[Catholic Church](Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") throughout the
world. In addition to this spiritual role, the Pope is also head of
the independent, sovereign State of Vatican City, a city-state
entirely surrounded by the city of Rome. Prior to 1870, the Pope's
temporal authority extended over a large area of central Italy, a
territory formally known as the "Patrimony of St Peter" under the
terms of the
[Donation of Constantine](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine "wikipedia:Donation of Constantine"),
but known more familiarly as the
[Papal States](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States "wikipedia:Papal States").
The office of the Pope is informally called the Papacy and formally
called the Pontificate; his ecclesiastical jurisdiction is called
the Holy See (*Sancta Sedes*). Roman Catholics worldwide consider
each pope to be [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")' representative on Earth.
The current pope is [Benedict XVI](Benedict_XVI "Benedict XVI").

## Origin

The name "pope" is the English form of the Latin "papa" which means
"father" and was a form of address for bishops in the early church
(contra Matthew 23:9). By about 500 AD the term was being applied
mainly to the Bishop of Rome until, in 1073, Gregory forbade
Catholics to call anyone "papa" except the bishop of Rome. At this
stage one can speak of a single "pope" as we know today albeit in a
much different form as many powers and privileges were bestowed as
time progressed.

## The role of Peter

Catholics are taught that Peter was the first Pope followed by
Linus whereas the historical evidence provides no basis for Peter
ever having been a bishop, nor was he in Rome for any length of
time. Indeed [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") names Linus as the
first bishop of Rome. The link to Peter appears to be an attempt to
benefit from the authority bestowed on Peter in Matthew 16:18 (the
Rock on which Jesus will build his church). Whilst Peter's
apostolic authority is evident in the New Testament, nowhere does
he assume a special leadership role above other apostles nor is
this otherwise indicated.

## The broken line of popes

The history of the papacy is indeed a regrettable account of
intrigue, corruption, political maneuvering and even violence. For
many years the pope was more powerful than the emperor. Papacies
were bought, murdered for and even run in parallel where disputes
could not be resolved.
