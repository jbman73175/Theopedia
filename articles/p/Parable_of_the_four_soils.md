The **parable of the four soils**^[[1]](#note-0)^ comes in the
context of the rejection of Christ by the Jewish religious leaders
and his own family members. Jesus tells his disciples this parable
to explain to them the reason why people were rejecting him. It was
not because there was anything wrong with Jesus himself or the
things he was doing, it was a matter of the heart of the person.

## Notes

1.  [â†‘](#ref-0) It is more commonly referred to as the
    *parable of the sower*, but this title ignores the emphasis that
    the parable gives to the soils. The main emphasis of the parable
    are the types of soils.
