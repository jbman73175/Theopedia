## Passage

Matthew 25:1-13

## Marriage custom

"Marriage custom of that day was as follows: The Groom would
prepare a place for his bride. It might be his own house or a place
at his father’s house. Then he would go to her father’s house to
get her. There might be a small party at her house, so there was a
small delay. Then the Bride and Groom would return to his father’s
house for the marriage feast or banquet (which usually lasted for
seven days). The ten young ladies would be somewhere along the
route between the bride’s house and the groom’s house. They are
waiting for the bride and groom to return and they hope to join the
procession and enter with them into the party. If they are with the
crowd, they will be able to slip right in. If they aren’t with the
procession, then the door keepers will turn them away because they
don’t know them. They don’t have an invitation."
