The **Parables of Jesus**, contrary to popular opinion, were not
given to clarify spiritual truth for everyone that heard them. They
were in fact given to obscure and hide the truth from some and
reveal the truth for those who had a heart which receives such
truth. When Jesus explained the purpose of his parables, he said
just that.

And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him
about the parables. And he said to them, "To you has been given the
secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is
in parables, so that 'they may indeed see but not perceive, and may
indeed hear but not understand, lest they should turn and be
forgiven.'" (Mark 4:10-12)
