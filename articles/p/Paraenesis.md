The term **paraenesis** or **parenesis**, derived from the Greek
παραίνεσις means "exhortation, advise, counsel﻿" (cf. ﻿Acts 27:9﻿,
﻿22﻿). As applied to a written work, the
*Oxford English Dictionary* defines it as "a hortatory
composition.﻿" In modern usage it denotes material characterized by
ethical instruction and exhortation.^[[1]](#note-0)^
