Patrick Fairbairn
**Patrick Fairbairn** (1805-1874) was born in Berwickshire,
Scotland, studied at Edinburgh University, and was an outstanding
scholar among Scottish
[Presbyterians](Presbyterian "Presbyterian"). After 27 years in
pastoral service, he served as divinity professor at the Free
Church College in Aberdeen before becoming principal of the Free
Church College, Glasgow, for 18 years until his death. His more
notable works include *Typology of Scripture*, and commentaries on
Ezekiel and The Pastoral Epistles.

In his *Hermeneutical Manual*, Patrick Fairbairn calls readers to a
sober examination of the [Bible](Bible "Bible"). He follows the
historic [Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") practice of allowing
the Scriptures to stand as their own witness and interpreter. The
author explains the
"[analogy of faith](Analogy_of_faith "Analogy of faith")," in
understanding the Bible. As summarized in the
[Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")
(1:9), this principle states: "The infallible rule of
interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself; and therefore,
when there is a question about the true and full sense of any
Scripture it must be searched and known by other places that speak
more clearly."
