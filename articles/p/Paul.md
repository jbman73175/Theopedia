**Paul**, also known as **Paul of Tarsus** (c. 9 - c. 65), was a
Roman citizen and [apostle](Apostle "Apostle") in the early church
shortly after the death of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). He is one of the
most important figures within
[Christian history](Church_history "Church history"). Many books
have been written on his life, theology, missiology, philosophy,
and his teachings have been studied since the beginning of the
Church. Paul's letters have encouraged, challenged, and inspired
Christians all around the world to "count everything as loss
because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus [our] Lord"
(Philippians 3:8, [ESV](ESV "ESV")).

## Early life

Saul (his name before his conversion) was born in Tarsus (Acts
9:11, 22:3), was an Israelite of the tribe of Benjamin, circumcised
on the eighth day, and was a [Pharisee](Pharisees "Pharisees")
(Romans 11:1; Philippians 3:5). As a Roman citizen, he was
exceedingly zealous for the traditions of his fathers and stood out
among the other Jews of his own age (Galatians 1:14).

Paul was brought up in Jerusalem and "trained in the school of
Gamaliel according to the strict interpretation of our ancestral
law," (Acts 22:3). Gamaliel was a leading Jewish teacher of his
day, "a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people," (Acts
5:34).

## Persecutor of the Church

Both Paul's letters and [Acts](Acts "Acts") (written by
[Luke](Luke "Luke")) tell us that Paul persecuted the church before
his [conversion](Conversion "Conversion"). He admits that in his
former life he tried violently to destroy God's church (Galatians
1:13). In the book of Acts he is shown to have given approval for
the stoning of [Stephen](Stephen "Stephen"), and "entering house
after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to
prison," (Acts 8:1-3).

## Call to apostleship

Saul was still hurling "threats and murder against the disciples of
the Lord" (Acts 9:1). He went to the high priest and attained
letters to the synagogues at Damascus, "so that if he found any
belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to
Jerusalem" (Acts 9:2). While on the road to Damascus, Paul
encountered the risen and exalted [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") (cf. Acts
9:4 ff.). Up until this point, Paul had heeded the claims of
Gamaliel, expecting those who were following Jesus to eventually
fall away (see Acts 5:34-39). Instead, Paul became a follower,
being calling himself the "apostle to the Gentiles" (Romans 11:13).
Paul was soon to understand what Jesus meant when he said, "for I
will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name,"
(Acts 9:16). Paul truly suffered, and learned to be content in all
situations (Philippians 4:11-13).

## Apostle to the Gentiles


Acts 22:21 "And he said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to
the Gentiles.'"

Acts 17 tells of Paul's travels, standing firmly upon the word of
God and how he traveled to Athens, where:

-   Acts 17:2 "...he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
    explaining and proving..."
    ([BLB: Acts 17:2](http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Act&c=17&v=2&t=KJV#top))
-   Acts 17:17 "...disputed he in the synogogue with the Jews,..."
    ([BLB: Acts 17:17](http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Act&c=17&v=17&t=KJV#17))
