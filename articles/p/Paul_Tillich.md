Paul Tillich
**Paul Johannes Tillich** (1886-1965) was a German-American
theologian and Christian
[existentialist](Existentialism "Existentialism") philosopher.
Tillich, along with contemporary
[Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth"), is considered by many as one
of the most influential Protestant theologians of the twentieth
century.

Tillich was born in Germany, in 1886. From 1904 to 1909 he studied
at universities in Berlin, Tübingen, and Halle, and in 1910 he
received the Ph. D. degree from the University of Breslau. He was
ordained in the [Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran") Church in Berlin in
1912 and served as an army chaplain on the Western front during
World War I.

From 1924-25 Tillich was Associate Professor of Theology at the
University of Marburg, from 1925-29 Professor of Philosophy and
Religious Studies at the Dresden Institute of Technology, and from
1929-33, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Frankfurt.

In 1933 Tillich's position was suspended by the Nazi government.
Later that year he accepted an invitation from
[Reinhold Niebuhr](Reinhold_Niebuhr "Reinhold Niebuhr") to teach at
the Union Theological Seminary and moved to New York. He was
Visiting Professor of Philosophy of Religion and Systematic
Theology at Union Theological Seminary from 1933 to 1937 and
continued there as a professor until 1955.

From 1955-62, he was University Professor at Harvard, and during
his last three years, the Nuveen Professor Theology in the Divinity
School, University of Chicago.
