**Pauline studies** is a sub-discipline within the larger framework
of [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") studies, which
itself is in an even *greater* realm of the discipline of Biblical
Studies (encompassing both the OT and NT). It involves many such
as: What letters did Paul really write? What was Paul's theology?
Was there a center to his theology? What is the background to his
letters and thought? What was his knowledge of
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")?
