**Pauline theology** is a term referring to the teaching and
doctrines especially espoused by the apostle [Paul](Paul "Paul")
through his writings. Mainstream
[Christianity](Christianity "Christianity") relies on Paulâ€™s
writings as integral to the
[biblical theology](Biblical_theology "Biblical theology") of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") and regards them as
amplifications and explanations consistent with the teachings of
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") and other NT writings.

Christian scholars generally use the term expressing interest in
the recovery of Christian origins and the contribution made by Paul
to Christian [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine"). Others, especially
non-Christian scholars, claim to see a Pauline distinctive
different from that found elsewhere in the New Testament, a
distinctive that unduly influenced later Christianity.
