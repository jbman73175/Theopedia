I pray that out of his glorious riches God will strengthen you with
power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may
dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being
rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all
the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the
love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledgeâ€”that
you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
(Ephesians 3:16 - 19
[NIV](New_International_Version "New International Version") )
