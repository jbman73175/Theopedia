May your love abound more and more in knowledge and depth of
insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be
pure and blameless until the day of Christ, filled with the fruit
of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ â€“ to the glory and
praise of God. (Philippians 1:9-11)
