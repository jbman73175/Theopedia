The much-loved **Peace Prayer of St. Francis** embodies a
self-effacing dedication to Christ-like ministry in the midst of
adversity. It was not written by
[St. Francis](Francis_of_Assisi "Francis of Assisi") but rather by
an anonymous author early in the 20th century. An implied theology
of justification by works in lines 14 and 15 undermines this
prayer's value as a devotional aid.

## Text of the Prayer

Lord make me an instrument of your peace
Where there is hatred,
Let me sow love;
Where there is injury, pardon;
Where there is error, truth;
Where there is doubt, faith;
Where there is despair, hope;
Where there is darkness, light;
And where there is sadness, joy.
O Divine Master grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled
As to console;
To be understood,as to understand;
To be loved, as to love.
For it is in giving that we receive,
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.
## Origin

The Peace Prayer is not one of the
[writings](http://www.franciscan-archive.org/patriarcha/opera/fwintro.html#contents)
of the saint. Father Schulz reports that it first appeared during
the First World War, written on a "holy card" of St. Francis, which
was inserted into a Normal Almanac. Although the prayer bore no
name it came to be called the Peace Prayer of St. Francis because
of this holy card.
