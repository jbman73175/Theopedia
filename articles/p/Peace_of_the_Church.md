The **peace of the church** is the unity of the Body of Christ,
which is made by the destruction of mutual hostility by the cross
of Christ, into which the nations are invited through the Gospel of
repentance and faith in Him, and it is the norm of the fellowship
of Christians according to the grace of God.

But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought
near by the blood of Christ. **For he himself is our peace**, who
has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing
wall of hostility by abolishing the law of commandments and
ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of
the two, so making peace, and might reconcile us both to God in one
body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. And he came
and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who
were near. For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the
Father. *(Ephesians 4:13-18)*
In contrast to separation from God through sin and unbelief, out of
which the hostilities of the world are born, the peace of the
church is always to be characterized by "unity and purity". Peace
without unity is mere tolerance. Peace without purity is a united
hostility to God. ^[[1]](#note-0)^ Thus, "the peace of the church"
often appears in phrases which obligate leaders of the church to
pursue and to preserve,
*the unity, purity and peace of the church*.

-   I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a
    manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with
    all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one
    another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the
    **bond of peace**. *(Ephesians 4:1-3)*
-   Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ,
    so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you
    that you are standing firm in **one spirit**, with one mind
    striving side by side for the faith of the gospel
    *(Philippians 1:27)*
-   ... complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same
    love, being in **full accord** and of one mind.
    *(Philippians 2:2)*

## Historical reference

Other than the theological usage expressed above, the phrase
**The Peace of the Church** refers to the period after 313 when
persecution of Christianity was halted. ^[[2]](#note-1)^ It is
should not be confused with the *Peace and Truce of God* which is
an expression for the Catholic Church's attempt to limit violence
in medieval society signed 989; similar to a combination of the UN
and Geneva Convention today. The *Truce of God* was a treaty signed
in 1027 prohibiting conflict on some holy days.
