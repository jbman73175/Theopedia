**Pelagianism** views humanity as basically good and morally
unaffected by [the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall"). It denies the
[imputation of Adam's sin](Imputation_of_Adam's_sin "Imputation of Adam's sin"),
[original sin](Original_sin "Original sin"),
[total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity"), and
[substitutionary atonement](Substitutionary_atonement "Substitutionary atonement").
It simultaneously views man as fundamentally good and in possession
of
[libertarian free will](Libertarian_free_will "Libertarian free will").
With regards to salvation, it teaches that man has the ability in
and of himself (apart from divine aid) to obey God and earn eternal
salvation. Pelagianism is overwhelmingly incompatible with the
Bible and was historically opposed by
[Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") (354-430), Bishop of Hippo,
leading to its condemnation as a [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") at
Council of Carthage in 418 A.D. These condemnations were summarily
ratified at the
[Council of Ephesus](Council_of_Ephesus "Council of Ephesus") (A.D.
431).

## Discussion

Pelagius was a monk from Britain, whose reputation and theology
came into prominence after he went to Rome sometime in the 380's
A.D. The historic Pelagian theological controversy involved the
nature of man and the doctrine of original sin.

Pelagius believed that the consequences of [Adam](Adam "Adam") and
Eve’s sin (the Fall) were restricted to themselves only; and
thereby denied the belief that original sin was passed on (or
transferred) to the children of Adam and thus to the human race.
Adam's [sin](Sin "Sin") merely "set a bad example" for his progeny
and [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") "set a good example" for mankind (thus
counteracting Adam's bad example). Pelagianism teaches that human
beings are born in a state of innocence with a nature that is as
pure as that which Adam was given at his creation.

As a result of his basic assumption, Pelagius taught that man has
an unimpaired moral ability to choose that which is spiritually
good and possesses the free will, ability, and capacity to do that
which is spiritually good. This resulted in a gospel of salvation
based on human works. Man could choose to follow the precepts of
God and then follow those precepts because he had the power within
himself to do so.

The controversy came to a head when Pelagian teaching came into
contact with Augustine. Augustine did not deny that man had a will
and that he could make choices. But, Augustine recognized that man
did not have a free will in moral issues related to God, asserting
that the effects original sin were passed to the children of Adam
and Eve and that mankind’s nature was thereby corrupted. Man could
choose what he desired, but those desires were influenced by his
sinful nature and he was unable to refrain from sinning.

Pelagius cleared himself of charges, primarily by hiding his real
beliefs; however, at the Council of Carthage in 418 A.D., his
teachings were branded as heresy. The Council of Ephesus in 431
A.D., again condemned Pelagian doctrine and it was banished in the
Greek portion of the church. However, in the West, the teachings
held on, primarily in Britain and Gaul.

Pelagian teaching was replaced with
[Semi-Pelagianism](Semi-Pelagianism "Semi-Pelagianism") which
sought a middle ground between Pelagianism and Augustinianism, but
it too was condemned at the Second Synod of Orange in 529 A.D.
However, elements of Semi-Pelagianism continued in the Western
(Roman) church. It emerged again after the Reformation in modified
form in [Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism") which was rejected
by the Reformed churches at the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort") in 1618-1619 A.D.
