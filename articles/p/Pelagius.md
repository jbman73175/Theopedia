**Pelagius** (354 - 420?) a British monk famous for his piety, but
declared a heretic for denying
[original sin](Original_sin "Original sin").

After studying Roman law and rhetoric and later theology in England
and Rome, he preached in Africa and Palestine, attracting able
followers, such as Celestius and Julian of Eclannum. Pelagius
thought that [Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") was excessively
pessimistic in his view that humanity is sinful by nature and must
rely totally upon grace for salvation. Instead Pelagius taught that
human beings have a natural capacity to reject evil and seek God,
that Christ's admonition, “Be ye perfect,” presupposes this
capacity, and that grace is the natural ability given by God to
seek and to serve God.^[[1]](#note-0)^

Pelagius rejected the doctrine of original sin; he taught that
children are born innocent of the sin of Adam. Baptism,
accordingly, ceased to be interpreted as a regenerative sacrament.
Pelagius challenged the very function of the church, claiming that
the law as well as the gospel can lead one to heaven and that
pagans had been able to enter heaven by virtue of their moral
actions before the coming of Christ. The church fought Pelagianism
from the time that Celestius was denied ordination in 411. In 415,
Augustine warned [Jerome](Jerome "Jerome") in Palestine that
Pelagius was propagating a dangerous heresy there, and Jerome acted
to prevent its spread in the East. Pelagianism was condemned by
East and West at the
[Council of Ephesus](Council_of_Ephesus "Council of Ephesus")
(431).^[[2]](#note-1)^

The cause and date of his death are unknown, but two pervading
rumours are that he was killed by his enemies in the Roman Church,
and the other (perhaps more grounded) that he left Rome in
frustration and headed into Africa and died in obscurity.
