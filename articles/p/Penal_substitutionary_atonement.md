**Penal substitutionary atonement** refers to the doctrine that
Christ died on the cross as a substitute for sinners. God imputed
the guilt of our sins to Christ, and he, in our place, bore the
punishment that we deserve. This was a full payment for sins, which
satisfied both the wrath and the righteousness of God, so that He
could forgive sinners without compromising His own holy standard.

## Background

The **Penal-Substitution Theory** of the atonement was formulated
by the 16th century Reformers as an extension of Anselm's
[Satisfaction theory](Satisfaction_theory "Satisfaction theory").
Anselm's theory was correct in introducing the satisfaction aspect
of Christ's work and its necessity; however the Reformers saw it as
insufficient because it was referenced to God's honor rather than
his justice and holiness and was couched more in terms of a
commercial transaction than a penal substitution. This Reformed
view says simply that Christ died for man, in man's place, taking
his sins and bearing them for him. The bearing of man's sins takes
the punishment for them and sets the believer free from the penal
demands of the law: The righteousness of the law and the holiness
of God are satisfied by this substitution.

## Relevant Scripture

-   Isaiah 53:6 - "the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us
    all."
-   Isaiah 53:12 - "yet he bore the sin of many, and makes
    intercession for the transgressors."
-   Romans 3:25
-   2 Corinthians 5:21 - "For our sake he made him to be sin who
    knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of
    God."
-   Galatians 3:13 - "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
    by becoming a curse for us -- for it is written,
    *Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree*."
-   Hebrews 10:1-4

The penal aspect of the atonement is often a stumbling block to
modern theology, yet some would say "it is the dominant Atonement
imagery used in the Bible."
[[1]](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/005/9.29.html) By
way of contrast, those who hold to a
[Governmental theory of atonement](Governmental_theory_of_atonement "Governmental theory of atonement")
not only deny the *penal* aspect of the atonement but also
*substitution* in the normal sense of the word. To such people,
Christ died not as a substitute for sinners but as a substitute for
punishment.

## Propitiation language

"The language of propitiation specifically implies God's hatred of
sin and emphasizes the gracious work of Christ as sin-bearer (Rom.
3:25). The Bible further includes the forensic, legal language of
justification (Rom. 3:20-26, 4:25, 5:16-18). These images make
clear the reality of our guilt and the required penalty."
[Dever](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/005/9.29.html)

See main article on [Propitiation](Propitiation "Propitiation").


## Relation to other doctrines

The principle of penal substitution is held, by many of its
proponents, to be the control through which all other views of the
accomplishments of Christ on the cross are to be seen and the
mechanic by which all other accomplishments work. Some examples of
this are given below.

The cross as ransom.
  ~ Jesus is described as having paid our ransom on the cross; but
    this image only works because Jesus was paying our penalty in our
    stead.
The cross as example.
  ~ Christians truly should be inspired by Christ's work on the
    cross to self-sacrifice; but this only happens because before our
    identification with Christ in his sufferings, Christ identified
    with us in our sin, bearing the punishment due in place of us.
The cross as victory.
  ~ Christ's death and resurrection were real victories over sin
    and death and hell; but once again, we only take part in the
    victory of the Son of God by virtue of our union with him, we can
    only be united with him if our sin is dealt with, that can only
    happen by the punishment for our sin being borne, and that
    punishment was borne by Christ our substitute.
The cross as reconciliation.
  ~ "...God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting
    their trespasses against them..." (2 Cor. 5:19, ESV). The exchange
    being contemplated here is that our sins are taken away by Christ's
    death and thus, we are made acceptable to God.

For further explanation and clarification, see Stott's
*The Cross of Christ*, which deals with this controlling imagery in
some detail (pp. 168-203, 217-224, 231-239).

## Criticisms

It is worth noting that a number of the critiques or cautions
regarding Penal Substitution come from those who embrace it. Major
proponents of Penal Substitution such as
[J. I. Packer](J._I._Packer "J. I. Packer"), and James Denney have
all critiqued various aspects of Penal Substitution.

-   Packer critiques any attempt to found it *solely* on human
    models of retributive justice and suggests that it be seen not as a
    mechanical explanation (how it works) but rather kerygmatically
    (what it means to us). ^[[1]](#note-0)^

-   Denney critiques the idea that it is merely forensic and
    judicial, saying that these are impersonal cold terms. "Few things
    have astonished me more than to be charged with teaching a
    'forensic' or 'legal' or 'judicial' doctrine of Atonement... There
    is nothing that I should wish to reprobate more whole-heartedly
    than the conception which is expressed by these
    words"^[[2]](#note-1)^

However, these critiques are not aimed at debunking the theory, but
rather to rescue it from its "cruder" forms of expression.

### Some note that it is not representative of the Early Church

[Gustav Aulen](Gustav_Aulen "Gustav Aulen") in his book
*Christus Victor* argues that Penal Substitution is not rooted in a
biblical understanding. He further argues that the
[early church father](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers")'s
primary model of the atonement was the dramatic image of Christ
overcoming sin, death, and the devil which as come to be known as
the "Christ Victor" view of the atonement^[[3]](#note-2)^.

A majority of Evangelical theologians while they would give primacy
to the Penal Substitution view acknowledge that Scripture has a
number of ways of speaking of the atonement, of which Penal
Substitution is one of many theories. One prominent example being
John Stott in his classic "The Cross of Christ" ^[[4]](#note-3)^

Other Evangelical theologians go a step further, while still
affirming Penal Substitution, they have come to view the
[Christus Victor](Christus_Victor "Christus Victor") view of the
Atonement as more central because it goes beyond dealing only with
man's sin and speaking of God's victory over the whole cosmos. One
example of this is [Gregory Boyd](Gregory_Boyd "Gregory Boyd") in
his book "God at War"^[[5]](#note-4)^. Scot McKnight for example
writes,

*"What I want to say is not that this theory is wrong... I want to say is that the atonement is so much more than this. And, if it is so much more than this, then it follows that using “penal substitution” as our guiding term is inadequate and misleads others. At the least, it does not provide enough information to explain what one really believes occurs in the Atonement"*^[[6]](#note-5)^

*See main article on [Christus Victor](Christus_Victor "Christus Victor").*

### Some view it as unjust

Opponents have argued that the idea of Penal Substitution is based
solely on the concept of a criminal justice system which demands
punishment for transgression. But no criminal justice system in the
world would ever say that it is just to punish the innocent in
place of the guilty. Some of the more prominent critics of penal
substitutionary theory, who advanced arguments such as these,
include Peter Abelard who criticized what he saw as the inherit
injustice of Anselm's theory, and Faustus Socinus in his polemic
*De Jesu Christo Servatore* (Of Jesus Christ the Saviour).

"What Socinus did was to arraign this idea as irrational,
incoherent, immoral and impossible. Giving pardon, he argued, does
not square with taking satisfaction, nor does the transferring of
punishment from the guilty to the innocent square with justice"
[J. I. Packer](http://www.the-highway.com/cross_Packer.html)

### Some argue that it is based on Natural Theology

[J.I. Packer](J.I._Packer "J.I. Packer") cautions that Penal
Substitution was formulated during a period when "Protestant
exegesis of Scripture was colored by an uncriticized and indeed
unrecognized natural theology of law. . . drawn from the world of
contemporary legal and political thought"
[[2]](http://www.the-highway.com/cross_Packer.html).
[Natural theology](Natural_theology "Natural theology") refers to
knowledge of God drawn from our world around us (in this case from
their own judicial concepts) as opposed to knowledge of God
contained in the revelation of Scripture. Although Packer demurs
basing Penal Substitution on the
[Natural theology](Natural_theology "Natural theology") of law and
*limiting* the concept to retributive language, he nevertheless
argues for the "substantial rightness of the Reformed view of the
atonement."

### Some suggest it necessarily implies universalism

"It seems logical that if the death of Yeshua satisfied God's need
for justice, and if humans made no contribution to the process,
then salvation and atonement should be granted to everyone -- to
Christian believers and unbelievers alike. It is unclear why only
those individuals who trust Yeshua as Lord and Savior will attain
salvation, atonement, and Heaven."
[[3]](http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_atone10.htm)

This argument has merit if indeed Christ died for all alike and his
atonement is effectual for all alike. But that requires other
theological assumptions to be superimposed on the doctrine.

*See main article on [universalism](Universalism "Universalism").*

### Some see it as "a form of cosmic Child Abuse"

In the UK, prominent member of the Evangelical Alliance Steve
Chalke has popularised an attack on penal substitution which argues
it portrays God as vengeful and unable to have a loving
relationship with his son Jesus. This has given rise to a
significant backlash, an example of which can be found in the
post*[Steve Chalke and the Lost Message of Jesus](http://adrianwarnock.com/2004/11/steve-chalke-and-lost-message-of-jesus.htm)*
on Adrian Warnock's blog. Steve Chalke has said that penal
substitution is "a theory rooted in violence and retributive
notions of justice" and is incompatible "at least as currently
taught and understood, with any authentically Christian
understanding of the character of God."
[Banner of Truth](http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?654)

### Some see it necessarily implying definite atonement

*See main article on [definite atonement](Definite_atonement "Definite atonement").*

Some tend to reject the penal-substitutionary aspect of the
atonement because it seems to imply a limited or definite design in
the atonement. However, it is worth noting that some scholars
holding to penal substitution maintain that definite atonement is
not a corollary of the position (see for instance,
[I. Howard Marshall (footnote 68)](http://www.eauk.org/theology/key_papers/Atonement/upload/ihowardmarshall.pdf).

### Some argue that He paid the debt of righteousness, not the penalty of death

"Jesus is the only one who made a pure and perfect sacrifice of His
life - when He died for our sakes on the cross. This was the debt
He paid on our behalf. It was not the penalty of death. He paid the
debt of righteousness - the gift to God of a righteous life, which
is our due. Christ's righteousness is our covering if we are united
in Him. The Father accepts us along with His Son. He has paid our
due offering that we may be covered by His life and judged
righteous. 'There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are
in Christ Jesus' (Rom.8:1). His righteous life is imputed to us who
look to Him and walk in the Spirit in oneness with Christ. It is
Jesus who is 'THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS' (Jer.23:6). Of ourselves,
we can never be righteous. It is only through faith in
Christ."['The Biblical Revelation of the Cross' - Online Edition](http://www.bible-study-online.org/atonement),

McIlwain
