The **pentateuch** represents the first five books of the Bible
(*Penta* meaning "five", and *teuch* meaning "book" in the Greek).
The term Pentateuch comes to us from the the ancient Greek
translation of the Scriptures called the
[Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint") via the
[Latin Vulgate](Latin_Vulgate "Latin Vulgate")
(*International Standard Bible Encyclopedia*, vol. 3, p. 740). It
is also referred to as "Torah", which in Hebrew means teaching,
instruction, or even law.
