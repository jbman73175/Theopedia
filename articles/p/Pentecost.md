**Pentecost**, from the [Greek](Greek "Greek") word meaning
*fiftieth*, refers both to an important Jewish feast day and the
recognized beginning of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") church.

The Jewish feast of Pentecost, in Hebrew *Shavuot* , the Feast of
Weeks, one of the three pilgrimage festivals, arose as the
celebration of the closing of the spring grain harvest, which
formally began 50 days earlier at Passover; there are numerous
references to it in the Bible, e.g. [Exodus](Exodus "Exodus") 34:22
and [Leviticus](Leviticus "Leviticus") 23:15. From Rabbinic times,
the festival commemorates the giving of the law to Moses at Mt.
Sinai.

On the Pentecost after the
[resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection") of Jesus (50 days from
the Passover in which He was crucified), the Holy Spirit, according
to the [Book of Acts](Acts_of_the_Apostles "Acts of the Apostles")
chapter 2, descended on the disciples in the form of tongues of
fire accompanied by the sound of a rush of wind, and gave them the
power of speaking in such a way that people of different languages
could understand them.

In liturgical Christianity, Pentecost is an annual commemoration of
this event, and it is solemnly observed as the birthday of the
church and the feast of the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit").
