The **Pentecostal** movement within protestant Christianity places
emphasis on the supernatural sign gifts of the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit"), especially the gift of
tongues first seen at [Pentecost](Pentecost "Pentecost") in Acts
chapter 2. Pentecostalism is similar to the
[Charismatic](Charismatic "Charismatic") movement, but developed
earlier and separated from the mainstream church.

## Theology

Theologically, most Pentecostal denominations are aligned with
Evangelicalism in that they emphasize the Scriptures and the need
for conversion to faith in Jesus. Most Pentecostals also adhere to
the doctrine of Biblical [inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy").
Pentecostals differ from most Fundamentalists in their belief in
the modern day operation and gifts of the Spirit.

Although "speaking in tongues" is often emphasized in
Pentecostalism, the idea that one is not saved unless one speaks in
tongues is rejected by most major Pentecostal denominations.

A small number of Pentecostal-type churches hold to
[Oneness theology](Oneness_Pentecostalism "Oneness Pentecostalism"),
which decries the traditional doctrine of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") as unbiblical. The largest Pentecostal
Oneness denomination in the United States is the United Pentecostal
Church. Oneness Pentecostals, are sometimes known as "Jesus-Name",
"Apostolics", or by their detractors as "Jesus only" Pentecostals.
This is due to the belief that the original Apostles baptized
converts in the name of Jesus. The majority of Oneness Pentecostals
believe that God has revealed Himself in different roles rather
than three distinct persons, for which see
[modalism](Modalism "Modalism"). Some modern Oneness adherents are
in an effort to distance Oneness theology from ancient modalism
because of the problems in the idea of God revealed in successive
roles.

The major trinitarian pentecostal organizations, however, including
the "Pentecostal World Conference" and the "Fellowship of
Pentecostal and Charismatic Churches of North America", have
condemned Oneness theology as a [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") and
refuse membership to churches holding this belief. The same holds
true for the Oneness Pentecostal towards trinitarian churches. It
should be noted that the Apostolic Church (UK) is also a strongly
[Trinitarian](Trinitarianism "Trinitarianism") Pentecostal
denomination.
