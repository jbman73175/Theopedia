**Perichoresis** is a [Greek](Greek "Greek") term used to describe
the [triune relationship](Trinity "Trinity") between each
[person](Person "Person") of the [Godhead](Godhead "Godhead"). It
can be defined as co-indwelling, co-inhering, and mutual
interpenetration.
[Alister McGrath](Alister_McGrath "Alister McGrath") writes that it
"allows the individuality of the persons to be maintained, while
insisting that each person shares in the life of the other two. An
image often used to express this idea is that of a 'community of
being,' in which each person, while maintaining its distinctive
identity, penetrates the others and is penetrated by them."

## Perichoresis in application

### Glory

The [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") demonstrates
that God brings [glory](Glory "Glory") to himself.
[John's Gospel](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") is important in
understanding how Jesus and the Father relate; a key passage for a
perichoretic understanding of God's glory is
[John 17:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:1;&version=47;),
where Jesus prays, "Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son
that the Son may glorify you." We see that the Son brings glory to
the Father, the Father brings glory to the Son, and the Spirit
brings glory to the Son (cf. John 16:14). Such an understanding of
glory exhibits the love expressed within the Godhead by Father, Son
and Spirit as they give glory to each other.
