**Perseverance of the saints** is the
[Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") doctrine that those who are
truly saved will persevere to the end and cannot lose their
salvation. It doesn't mean that a person who is truly saved will
never lose faith or backslide at any time. But that they will
ultimately persevere in faith (inspite of failures) such as not to
lose their salvation.

The doctrine of perseverance is rooted in God's
[unconditional election](Election "Election") and
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination"). That is, since
God is the One who chose and predestined the elect to salvation,
therefore the elect will be saved. They might turn away from faith
and give appearance of losing their salvation, but if they really
are elect they will repent and ultimately return to faith, because
God is the One ensuring their salvation.

This doctrine is also closely related to the doctrine of
[justification](Justification "Justification") and adoption.
Because God is the One who justifies the elect, no one can bring
any condemnation on them. In the same way because those who truly
believe in Christ are adopted as God's sons, they cannot be
condemned to eternal punishment (although subject to God's loving
discipline as a Father).

## History of the doctrine

The traditional doctrine is one of the
[five points of Calvinism](TULIP "TULIP") that were defined at the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort") (1618-1619) during
the controversy over [Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism")
teaching, which objected to the general predestinarian scheme of
Calvinism.

The doctrine of perseverance is articulated in the
[Canons of Dort](Canons_of_Dort "Canons of Dort") (chapter 5), the
[Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")
of Faith (Chapter XVII), the
[London Baptist Confession of 1689](London_Baptist_Confession_of_1689 "London Baptist Confession of 1689")
(Chapter 17), and may also be found in other Reformed Confessions.

## Eternal Security

"Eternal security" is often seen as synonymous with "Perseverance
of the saints." That is, a person who truly trusts in Christ, may
have [assurance](Assurance "Assurance") of eternal life with God,
and thus be eternally secure. Historically, this comes from a
biblical, Calvinistic framework, wherein salvation is secure
because the perseverance of the saved person is certain.

Today, however, the doctrine of eternal security is usually
expressed without the reference to the perseverance (or
continuance) and other means of grace indicative of true
saving/justifying faith. This mind-set goes hand-in-hand with the
"[easy believism](Easy_believism "Easy believism")" and "carnal
Christianity" so prevalent in the evangelical church today. It is
characterized by the trite phrase "once saved, always saved",
suggesting that one may continue in a life of willful sin and be
confident of salvation because he has made a profession of faith in
the past. This goes against biblical exhortations, warnings for
final salvation and qualifications of true saving faith. For
example :

-   John 15:6 "If anyone does not abide in Me, he is
    *thrown away as a branch and dries up*; and they gather them, and
    *cast them into the fire* and they are *burned.*"
-   Heb 12:14 "Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification
    *without which no one will see the Lord.*"
-   Eph 5:5-6 "For this you know with certainty, that
    *no immoral or impure person* or covetous man, who is an idolater,
    *has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God*. Let no one
    *deceive you with empty words*, for because of these things the
    wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience."
-   1 John 2:3-4 "By this we know that we have come to know Him,
    *if we keep His commandments*. The one who says, "I have come to
    know Him," and does not keep His commandments,
    *is a liar, and the truth is not in him;*"
-   1 Cor. 10:1-6 "For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren,
    that our fathers were *all under the cloud* and
    *all passed through the sea*; and all were *baptized* into Moses in
    the cloud and in the sea; and all ate the same spiritual food; and
    all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were
    *drinking from a spiritual rock* which followed them; and
    *the rock was Christ*. Nevertheless,
    *with most of them God was not well-pleased*; for they were laid
    low in the wilderness."
-   2 Cor 13:5 "*Test yourselves* {to see} if you are in the faith;
    *examine yourselves!* Or do you not recognize this about
    yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in
    you--*unless indeed you fail the test?*"
-   James 2:14-17 "What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he
    has faith but he has no works? *Can that faith save him?* If a
    brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,
    and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be
    filled,” and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their
    body, what use is that? Even so
    *faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.*"

Definitive wandering is deadly and maybe a sign that one is not
truly saved. Christians in the bible are warned and encouraged over
and over again to not give up, but to persevere in faith in order
to be saved. "Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under
trial," as James says, "for **when** he has stood the test he will
receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love
him." (James 1:12)

### Quotes

"*We do not teach* that any man is entitled to believe that he is
justified, and therefore shall not come again in condemnation on
the proposition "once in grace always in grace," although he be now
*living in intentional, willful sin*. This falsehood of Satan we
abhor. We say,
*the fact that this deluded man can live in willful sin is the strongest possible proof that he never was justified*,
and never had any grace to fall from. And, once for all, no
intelligent believer can possibly abuse this doctrine into a
pretext for carnal security. It promises to true believers a
*perseverance in holiness*. Who, except an idiot, could infer from
that promise the privilege to be unholy?"
([R. L. Dabney](R._L._Dabney "R. L. Dabney"),
*The Five Points of Calvinism*)
"How preposterous and irrational must it be in a man who thinks
himself to be a child of God, and
*believes he shall persevere to the end*, from this consideration
to *indulge himself in all manner of sin*, as if resolving that he
will persevere no longer!" ([John Gill](John_Gill "John Gill"),
*The Cause of God and Truth*, Part 3, section 6)
## Biblical support

These passages show God's ability to save completely those He had
chosen to save.

-   Romans 8:29 "For *those whom He foreknew*, He also
    *predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son*, so that
    He would be the firstborn among many brethren"
-   Jeremiah 32:40 “I will make an *everlasting* covenant with them
    *that I will not turn away from them, to do them good*; and I will
    put the fear of Me in their hearts
    *so that they will not turn away from Me*."
-   Romans 14:4 "Who are you to judge the servant of another? To
    his own master he stands or falls; and *he will stand*, for the
    Lord is *able to make him stand*."
-   Philippians 1:6: "And I am sure of this, that he who
    *began a good work* in you *will bring it to completion* at the day
    of Jesus Christ."
-   Jude 1:24 "Now to Him who is *able to keep you from stumbling*,
    and to *make you stand* in the presence of His glory *blameless*
    with great joy"
-   1 Peter 1:3-5 "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
    Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born
    again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
    from the dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and
    undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,
    *who are protected by the power of God through faith* for a
    salvation ready to be revealed in the last time"
-   John 10:28-29: "I give them eternal life, and
    *they will never perish*, and no one will snatch them out of my
    hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and
    no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand."
-   Romans 11:29: "For the gifts and the calling of God are
    *irrevocable.*"

In the following passages, the point is that one has been truly
saved (past tense/ past event), if he perseveres to the end.
Otherwise, he proves he had never been truly saved.

-   1 Corinthians 15:1-2 - "Now I would remind you, brothers, of
    the gospel I preached to you, which *you received*, in which you
    stand, and by which you are being saved,
    *if you hold fast to the word* I preached to
    you—*unless you believed in vain.*"
-   Hebrews 3:14 - "For we *have become* partakers of Christ, *if*
    we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end"
-   Hebrews 3:6 - "but Christ was faithful as a Son over His
    house—*whose house we are, if* we hold fast our confidence and the
    boast of our hope firm until the end."
-   Col 1:22-23 "yet He has *now reconciled you* in His fleshly
    body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and
    blameless and beyond reproach—
    *if indeed you continue in the faith* firmly established and
    steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you
    have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and
    of which I, Paul, was made a minister."

Other passages that affirm the need to endure to the end to be
saved.

-   Matthew 24:12-13 "Because lawlessness is increased,
    *most people’s love will grow cold*.
    *But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved*" (cf. Mark
    13:13)
-   Matthew 10:22 "You will be hated by all because of My name, but
    it is the one who has *endured to the end* who will be saved."
-   Galatians 6:9 - "And let us not grow weary of doing good, for
    in due season we will reap, *if we do not give up.*"
-   James 5:19-20 - "My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from
    the truth and someone brings him back, let him know that whoever
    brings back a sinner from his wandering will
    *save his soul from death* and will cover a multitude of sins."

## Arminian Objections

Arminian objection to this doctrine is primarily centered on the
concept of man's free will (in the
[Libertarian](Libertarian_free_will "Libertarian free will")
sense). That is, God does not predetermine or influence the
individual's choice, but He lets them choose freely their destiny.
In such an understanding, God neccessarily cannot ensure the final
salvation of anyone because they always have the free choice to
turn away from faith.

Arminians generally have their own interpretation of Calvinist
proof texts for the doctrine of Perseverance. Arminians will appeal
to a conditional election or corporate election understanding of
Calvinist security verses. While there are different ways for
Arminians to interpret Calvinist proof texts, but the bottom line
is that they will always put the final decision for salvation on
the free choice of individuals, not on God.

Arminians will also use verses that give warnings against falling
away from faith, to argue against the doctrine of Perseverance of
the Saints. They also argue from verses that appeal for a decision
on the individual to persevere. That is, the individual has to make
the decision to persevere, and God cannot make them persevere if
they don't want to.

It should be noted however, that historic Calvinism affirms the
need to persevere to be saved, and the need for the individuals to
actively believe and persevere. This creates an antinomy (or
paradox) since Calvinism equally affirms that God is completely
sovereign in the affairs of men, including human decisions. For
example :

-   Phil 2:12-13 "So then, my beloved, just as you have always
    obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my
    absence, *work out your salvation* with fear and trembling;
    *for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work* for
    His good pleasure."
-   Acts 4:27-29 “For truly in this city there were gathered
    together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both
    Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples
    of Israel,
    *to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose predestined to occur*.
    And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and
    *grant that Your bond-servants may speak Your word with all confidence*".
-   2 Tim 2:24-25 "The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome,
    but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with
    gentleness correcting those who are in opposition,
    *if perhaps God may grant them repentance* leading to the knowledge
    of the truth"
-   2 Sam 17:14 "Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The
    counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of
    Ahithophel.” For the LORD
    *had ordained to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel*, so that
    the LORD might bring calamity on Absalom."
-   1 Sam 2:23-25 "He said to them, “Why do you do such things, the
    evil things that I hear from all these people? “No, my sons; for
    the report is not good which I hear the LORD’S people circulating.
    “If one man sins against another, God will mediate for him; but if
    a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?” But
    *they would not listen* to the voice of their father,
    *for the LORD desired to put them to death.*"

Calvinists also argue that if God is not sovereign over the
decisions and choices of individuals, then it would be pointless to
pray for the salvation of anyone, or repentance of someone in sin.
Furthermore, all the verses that promise protection or security to
the believer would be pointless, because God will apparently not
prevent someone from falling from faith. The power of God's new
covenant promises would be pointless and ineffective, the blood of
Jesus insufficient to complete the purchase of individuals.
