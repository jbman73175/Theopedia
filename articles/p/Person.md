"By 'person' we mean one who has his own identity or individuality
as a rational being, conscious of his own existence."
[[1]](http://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/nbi/404.html) In other
words, a person is a particular being with generally one center of
consciousness. In the [Being](Being "Being") of God there are three
Centers of consciousness. A person is unique among beings in having
capacities to reason and exercise the will.
