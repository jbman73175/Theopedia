**Peter** (died c. 65), also known as **Simon Peter** or
**Cephas**, was one of the

[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") chose. He is frequently mentioned throughout
the [Gospels](Gospels "Gospels") and [Acts](Acts "Acts"), and is
the author of two epistles. Tradition has also found Peter to be
the source for the
[Gospel of Mark](Gospel_of_Mark "Gospel of Mark").
