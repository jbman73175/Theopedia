Peter Lombard
**Peter Lombard** (ca. 1095 â€“ 1160), also known as the "Master of
the Sentences" or "the Lombard", was a
[scholastic](Scholasticism "Scholasticism") theologian and bishop
of the 12th century. Lombard was born in Lumellogno, near Novara,
Italy, to a poor family. He must have begun his education in Italy,
most likely at the cathedral schools of Novara and Lucca. The
patronage of Otto, bishop of Lucca, and of St. Bernard allowed him
to leave Italy and further his studies at Reims and Paris. In
Paris, he came into contact with Peter Abelard and Hugh of St.
Victor, who were among the leading theologians of the time. Around
1145, Peter became a "magister," or professor, at the cathedral
school of Notre Dame in Paris.

In 1159, he was named bishop of Paris.

## "Book of Sentences"

He is best known for his *Four Books of Sentences*, written between
1147-1151. The book is a compilation of extracts from the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"),
[Fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers") (especially
[Augustine](Augustine "Augustine")), and other sources of authority
that touches on the entire field of Christian theology. Peter
Lombard's genius consisted in the selection of passages, his
attempt to reconcile them where they appeared to defend different
viewpoints, and his arrangement of the material in a systematic
order. Thus, the "Book of Sentences" starts with the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") in Book I, then moves on to
[creation](Creation "Creation") in Book II, treats
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"), the savior of the fallen creation, in Book
III, and deals with the [sacraments](Sacraments "Sacraments"),
which mediate Christ's grace, in Book IV.

After its composition it "became a standard work of theology
throughout the Middle Ages in Europe. Almost every ambitious young
theological scholar had to write a commentary on it" (Olson,
*The Story of Christian Theology*, p. 350). It can been said that
there is no work of Christian literature, except for the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") itself, that has been commented upon more
frequently. All the major medieval thinkers, from
[Albert the Great](index.php?title=Albert_the_Great&action=edit&redlink=1 "Albert the Great (page does not exist)")
and [Thomas Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") to
[William of Ockham](index.php?title=William_of_Ockham&action=edit&redlink=1 "William of Ockham (page does not exist)")
and
[Gabriel Biel](index.php?title=Gabriel_Biel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gabriel Biel (page does not exist)"),
were influenced by it. Even the young
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") still wrote glosses
on the "Sentences."

Peter Lombard's most famous and most controversial
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") in the "Sentences" was his
identification of charity with the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") in Book I, distinction 17.
According to this doctrine, when we love [God](God "God") and
neighbor, this love literally is God; we become divine and are
taken up into the life of the Trinity. This idea was never declared
unorthodox, but few theologians have been prepared to follow Peter
Lombard in his audacious teaching.

## The Sacraments

Lastly, Peter Lombard was the first to give what is now the
standard [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") list of
seven sacraments. During Lombard's time, anywhere from two to
twelve had been proposed, but once Lombard proposed seven - a
'perfect number' - it was rapidly accepted though not all chose the
same seven as he did. His list was later defined as orthodoxy by
the
[Council of Florence](index.php?title=Council_of_Florence&action=edit&redlink=1 "Council of Florence (page does not exist)")
in 1439 (Lane, *Exploring Christian Thought*, p. 94).
