**Peter Martyr** (1206 - April 6, 1252), also known as
**Peter of Verona**, was a 13th century Dominican friar. He is
sometimes confused with
[Peter Martyr Vermigli](Peter_Martyr_Vermigli "Peter Martyr Vermigli")
(1499-1562), a theologian of the Reformation period.

The son of Cathari, Peter is said to have maintained his orthodoxy
and at the age of fifteen, met Saint Dominic at the University of
Bologna. Peter joined the Dominicans and became a celebrated
preacher throughout northern and central Italy. In 1252, he was
appointed as an inquisitor, though he had been fighting against
heretics since the 1230's. Many miracles are attributed to him by
the Roman Catholic church. He was canonized on March 9, 1253 by
Pope Innocent IV only 337 days after his death, making him the
fastest papally canonized saint in history.

He was murdered on the road between Como and Milan by Cathari.
Carino cut his head with an axe, and then gave Peter's companion
Dominic several fatal wounds. His murderer, Carino, eventually
became a Dominican at Forli and is the subject of a local cult as
"Blessed Carino of Balsamo".
