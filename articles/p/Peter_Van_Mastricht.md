**Peter Van Mastricht** (1630-1706) was a German-Dutch theologian
who studied at Utrecht under Gisbert Voetius. He held pastorates in
Germany and Denmark before accepting a position as professor of
[Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew") and practical theology at Frankfurt, and
later at his alma mater, Utrecht. Van Mastricht is probably best
known for his *Theologia Theoretico-Practica* (1682-87), a
comprehensive and infuential work that was translated into Dutch
and won much acclaim. Van Mastricht deeply shaped the experiential
piety of the “Nadere Reformation” in the Netherlands, as well as
larger currents of
[Reformed theology](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology"), even
within English-speaking divinity from the late 17th century
onward.

[Jonathan Edwards](Jonathan_Edwards "Jonathan Edwards") wrote to
young Joseph Bellamy in 1747 that this work of Van Mastricht was “.
. . much better than
[Turretin](Francis_Turretin "Francis Turretin"), or any other book
in the world, except the [Bible](Bible "Bible"), in my opinion.”
Edwards incorporated many of Van Mastricht’s ideas in his famous
book, *The Freedom of the Will*.

A section from his *Theologia Theoretico-Practica* on the topic of
[regeneration](Regeneration "Regeneration") was translated and
first published in English in 1770. It was re-issued in 2002 as
*A Treatise on Regeneration* (SDG Press), edited by Brandon
Withrow. Van Mastricht’s treatment of regeneration is, in many
respects, typical of the late 17th century and many aspects would
be readily recognized, particularly the explanation of regeneration
as an instantaneous introduction of a new principle of life into
the heart by the Spirit, logically prior to
[faith](Faith "Faith").
