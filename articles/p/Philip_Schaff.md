Philip Schaff
**Philip Schaff** (1819-1893) was a Swiss-born, German-educated
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian") and a historian of the
[Christian](Christian "Christian") church, who, after his
education, lived and taught in the United States.

He was born in Chur, Switzerland, and was educated at the gymnasium
of Stuttgart, and at the universities of Tübingen, Halle and
Berlin. He then traveled through Italy and Sicily as tutor to Baron
Krischer. In 1842 he was Privatdozent in the University of Berlin,
and in 1843 he was called to become professor of church history and
Biblical literature in the German Reformed Theological Seminary of
Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, then the only seminary of that church in
America.

On his journey he stayed in England and met Edward Pusey and other
Tractarians. His inaugural address on The Principle of
Protestantism, delivered in German at Reading, Pennsylvania, in
1844, and published in German with an English version by John
Williamson Nevin was a pioneer work in English in the field of
symbolics (that is, the authoritative ecclesiastical formulations
of religious doctrines in creeds or confessions). This address and
the "Mercersburg Theology" which he taught seemed too pro-Catholic
to some, and he was charged with heresy. But, at the synod at York
in 1845, he was unanimously acquitted.

In consequence of the ravages of the American Civil War the
theological seminary at Mercersburg was closed for a while and so
in 1863 Dr. Schaff became secretary of the Sabbath Committee in New
York City, and held the position till 1870. He became a professor
at Union Theological Seminary, New York City in 1870 holding first
the chair of theological encyclopedia and Christian symbolism till
1873, of Hebrew and the cognate languages till 1874, of sacred
literature till 1887, and finally of church history, till his
death.
