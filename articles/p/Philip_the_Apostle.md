Jesus called **Philip** to be a disciple (John 1:44) as he (Jesus)
was leaving Bethany after being baptized by
[John](John_the_Baptist "John the Baptist") (John 1:28). Philip's
immediate response was to go and find
[Nathanael](Nathanael "Nathanael") and tell him "We have found the
one Moses wrote about in the law, and about whom the prophets also
wrote – Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."

We learn most about Philip from the Gospel of John, but his name
appears in all the synoptic gospels as well (Matthew 10:3, Mark
3:18, Luke 6:14). He was from Bethsaida, in Galilee (John 12:21).
When Jesus needed to feed the five thousand (John 6:5-7) he
rhetorically asked Philip for suggestions and Philip's answer was
practical, if uninspired. Later when Philip had to take a message
to Jesus (John 12:22) he asked Andrew to accompany him, perhaps
indicating the awe which he felt in the presence of the Lord. He
took an active part in the disciples' discussions with Jesus (John
14:8) but, like most of the disciples, was perhaps a bit slow in
understanding what Jesus was telling them (John 14:9).

Philip the apostle should not be confused with
[Philip the evangelist](Philip_the_evangelist "Philip the evangelist")
(Acts 21:8), even though they both displayed an instinct for
evangelism. They knew each other though – Philip, as one of the
apostles, prayed for and laid hands on Philip the evangelist (Acts
6:6) at the start of the latter's ministry.

## Non-biblical biography

There is little written about Philip the apostle's life after Jesus
died. Polycrates of Ephesus, in a letter written about 190, refers
to his grave as being in Hieropolis. There is some debate about
whether that might actually be the grave of
[Philip the evangelist](Philip_the_evangelist "Philip the evangelist")
because the letter mentions three daughters, which could be the
daughters mentioned in Acts 21:9. The remains of whichever Philip
it was were later moved first to Constantinople and then to the
church of the Dodici Apostoli in Rome, where they are now
identified as the remains of the apostle.
