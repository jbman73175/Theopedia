**Philip the evangelist** was one of seven men (including
[Stephen](Stephen "Stephen")) chosen by the
[apostles](Apostle "Apostle") to oversee the distribution of food
to Jewish widows in Jerusalem (Acts 6:1-3). Those seven were chosen
as "full of the Spirit and wisdom" and were ordained to that
ministry by the apostles, with a laying on of hands (Acts 6:6).

Stephen's [martyrdom](Martyr "Martyr") and the ensuing persecution
of the Jerusalem church drove Philip to Samaria (Acts 8:4) where he
preached, did miraculous works, cast out evil spirits, and healed
the sick. Many people of Samaria, "both high and low", who had only
recently been fascinated by a
[magician](Simon_the_Magician "Simon the Magician"), believed
Philip and were baptized. Later, led by the Spirit, Philip
overheard a senior court official from Ethiopia reading
[Isaiah](Book_of_Isaiah "Book of Isaiah") and used the opportunity
to lead him to faith and baptize him (Acts 8:26-38). It is thus not
surprising that Luke knew Philip as "the evangelist" (Acts 12:8).

According to Acts 21:8-9, Philip settled in Caesarea, where he
raised a family of four daughters.
