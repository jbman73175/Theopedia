## Study

[Moore Theological College](Moore_Theological_College "Moore Theological College"),
and won the Hey Sharp prize for coming first in the ThL (Licenciate
of Theology), a year after his brother Peter also won it.



## Ministry

### University of New South Wales

Phillip became the Anglican Chaplain at the University of New South
Wales (UNSW) in 1975.

Basing his University ministry around
[expository preaching](Expository_preaching "Expository preaching"),
"walk-up [evangelism](Evangelism "Evangelism")" and Ministry
Training, Phillip Jensen and
[Campus Bible Study](http://www.campusbiblestudy.org/)
revolutionised student ministry in Sydney. The result was a large
number of conversions, large student gatherings at UNSW, and the
growth of St Matthias from a group of 20-30 in 1977 to well over
1000 by the mid 1990s.

### St Matthias

Phillip became Rector of St Matthias, Centennial Park, in 1977.

### Ministry Training Strategy

Phillip Jensen's work at UNSW included the creation of the Ministry
Training Strategy (MTS) which took willing young men and women and
trained them in practical ministry skills, preparing them for a
lifetime of ministry, ordained or otherwise. Other initiatives
included the establishment of a publishing company - Matthias
Media.

It was the strong growth of the MTS strategy in other universities
and churches throughout the 1980s and 1990s that saw student
numbers at Moore Theological College grow from around 150 in 1985
to over 400 in 2004. Many of these graduates are now Rectors of
Anglican Churches in Sydney, and leaders in many evangelical
churches throughout Sydney and the world.

### St Andrew's Cathedral

In 2003 the Cathedral Chapter of St Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney
appointed Phillip Jensen as Dean of St Andrew's Cathedral in
Sydney. Attendance has strongly increased since his appointment,
and the cathedral now has many services, both traditional and
contemporary.

## Publications

Jensen authored the popular
[Two Ways To Live](http://www.matthiasmedia.com.au/2wtl/)
[Evangelistic tract](Gospel_presentations "Gospel presentations"),
and founded The Briefing, an insightful and sometimes polemical
magazine that mixes conservative Evangelical and Calvinistic
theology with intellectual rigour. Phillip Jensen has also
authiored numerous
[books and Bible studies](http://phillipjensen.com/books/) on
practical Christian living.
