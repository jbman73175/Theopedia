**Philosophical theology** is a term used to describe the process
of doing theology with the aid and support of philosophical
reflection, language, and methods. Philosophical theology is
sometimes viewed as a sub-category of
[philosophy of religion](Philosophy_of_religion "Philosophy of religion"),
providing ways to understand different
[doctrines](Doctrine "Doctrine") or theological concepts through
the use of philosophy. There are typically two different categories
in philosophical theology: "The first category includes attempts to
demonstrate the truth of religious claims by appeal to evidence
available apart from purported divine revelations. The second
category includes attempts to demonstrate the consistency and
plausibility of theological claims using philosophical techniques."
^[[1]](#note-0)^ This first category uses what is called
[natural theology](Natural_theology "Natural theology") to
understand Christian claims. The second appeals to philosophy to
understand theological convictions derived from
[divine revelation](Revelation_of_God "Revelation of God").
