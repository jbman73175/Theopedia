**Pietism** was originally a reform movement in the German
[Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran") Church during the 17th and 18th
centuries, which endeavored to renew the devotional ideal in the
Protestant religion. The most predominant trait of pietism is its
emphasis on a practical, active piety (*praxis pietatis*) rather
than on doctrine. This involved, among other things, an emphasis on
the performance of good works, the scrutinization of daily life,
the diligent study of the Scriptures with particular reference to
its moral teachings, the centrality of forming a personal and
experiential relationship with God and disassociation from worldly
practices such as dancing and non-religious reading, inevitably
leading to separatism and a sense of exclusivity.

Continental pietism proved to be influential throughout
Protestantism, and along with Reformed
[puritanism](Puritanism "Puritanism"), inspired the
[Methodist](Methodist "Methodist") movement in England and was the
formational heritage of
[Jonathan Edwards](Jonathan_Edwards "Jonathan Edwards") in America
and the emphasis on individual piety, and a vigorous Christian
life.
