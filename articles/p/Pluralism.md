**Pluralism** sees all religions as legitimate and valid when
viewed from within their own cultural background and tradition. The
general conception is that no one religion has an exclusive claim
on the truth, but all constitute varying conceptions of the
Ultimate Reality. In John Stott’s opinion, “Pluralism is an
affirmation of the validity of every religion, and the refusal to
choose between them, and the rejection of world evangelism.”
(Interview in *Orange County Register*, Oct. 3, 1998)

According to Rick Rood, “Religious Pluralism is the view that all
religions are equally valid as ways to God. Pluralists often refer
to the fact that, just as there are many paths up Mt. Fuji, so
there are many paths to God. Differences among the religions are
superficial; they all lead to the same goal. This is the epitome of
tolerance and relativism."

## Proponents

[John Hick](index.php?title=John_Hick&action=edit&redlink=1 "John Hick (page does not exist)"),
a theologian and philosopher, holds that all religions are equal in
the sense that all religions accomplish the same end; creating good
moral people. He viewed all religions as being different responses
to the divine reality, and therefore all religious paths lead to
the same reality.
