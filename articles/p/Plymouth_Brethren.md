The **Plymouth Brethren** are a conservative Christian evangelical
movement that began in Ireland and England in the late 1820s in
reaction to the established Church. The movement became known for
its anti-denominational, anti-clerical, and anti-credal stance.
They do not generally refer to themselves as "Plymouth Brethren,"
nor do they regard themselves as a
[denomination](Denomination "Denomination").

## Background

The Plymouth Brethren movement was founded by Dr. Edward Cronin,
Edward Wilson, John Bellett, and Francis Hutchinson, and others who
felt that the established Church had become too involved with the
secular state and abandoned many of the basic truths of
Christianity. The group began by meeting in households in Ireland,
and were dubbed "brethren" because of their practice of calling
each other "brother" instead of the titles favoured by other
denominations. The movement became prominent through the early
leadership and ministry of
[John Nelson Darby](John_Nelson_Darby "John Nelson Darby"), the
father of
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism").

The movement soon spead throughout the UK and by 1831, the group
assembled in Plymouth, England had over 1,500 members. These
members became known as "The brethren from Plymouth" and soon were
simply called the "Plymouth Brethren". The group is also known as
the "Assembly movement." The term Darbyites has also been used,
although is uncommon and refers mainly to the Exclusive branch.

### Open vs. Exclusive

The Brethren are divided into "Open" and "Exclusive" branches. The
Exclusive (or Closed) Brethren maintain a very isolationist view,
with many of their children home schooled, a strict dress code for
church meetings, and members commonly self employed or working for
Christian organizations. The Open Brethren are less prone to these
practices and are more open to visitors.

When arriving at one assembly from another, it was a common
practice for the leaders to send a "letter of commendation" (Rom.
16:1; 2 Cor. 3:1, 5:12, 12:11) with the newcomer to inform the new
assembly that they are in fellowship at another assembly and can be
allowed to fully participate in all meetings upon arrival. It was
customary to send one of these letters even when only one service
will be attended, and individuals often took these letters on
holiday when they will be away from their local church and wish to
attend another. These letters might include details such as the
spiritual gifts of the individual as well as recommendation from
the elders of the assembly.

Open Brethren remain affiliated with one another, mostly through
common support of missionaries, area conferences, and the ministry
of traveling preachers. Over the years, they have come to resemble
other [Protestant](Protestantism "Protestantism") evangelical
churches, except that there are no officially recognized clergy and
the Lord's Supper is celebrated weekly - both of which are common
to Open and Exclusive groups alike.

## Terminology

The Plymouth Brethren are unusual in modern Christianity by not
recognizing a [denominational](Denomination "Denomination") name;
they do not generally refer to themselves as "Plymouth Brethren,"
nor do they regard themselves as a denomination. Much like
individuals who would not like to label themselves as a Calvinist
or an Augustinian, so also the Plymouth Brethren do not think it
right to label themselves anything other than Christian. They feel
that having a name attached to their gathering would distract from
the Head of the Body, that is Christ. Thus there is no
denominational headquarters and no governing body to which local
assemblies are accountable. Local assemblies are autonomous but are
often informally linked with each other.

The Plymouth Brethren refer to their fellowships as *assemblies*
(from the Greek word *ekklesia*), and members are simply called
"brothers," "saints," or "believers." Members are usually aware of
the term "Plymouth Brethren" but deny it applies to them since they
don't consider themselves a denomination. Formal "membership" in
the sense demonstrated by the denominations is generally eschewed
as unnecessary since personal salvation is understood to be the
only requirement for membership in the body of Christ. Believers
"come into fellowship" upon their declaration of their desire to be
identified with the assembly testimony at a particular location.
Water baptism is usually required for "fellowship" in a local
company but is not considered mandatory for salvation. Fellowship
is defined as being accepted to "break bread" or participate in the
Lord's Supper.

Some Plymouth Brethren meeting places have an outdoor sign
indicating a weekly meeting set apart for
[Communion](Communion "Communion") (1 Cor 10:16, KJV), usually
referred to with other biblical descriptions such as "Breaking of
Bread" (Acts 2:42), "The Lord's Supper" (1 Cor 11:20), or "The
Remembrance Meeting" (1 Cor 11:25).

Many Brethren assemblies meet in a building called a "Gospel Hall,"
"Gospel Chapel," or "Bible Chapel."

## Characteristics

Brethren assemblies are generally
[dispensational](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") in their
theology, and the Open Brethren have much in common with other
conservative evangelical Christian groups. Their notable
distinctions lie in a combination of the
[doctrinal](Doctrine "Doctrine") and practical matters related to
the conduct of the "meeting of the church."

The Brethren believe in the divine inspiration of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") and that the same Bible gives clear guidance
about how services of worship are to be held. These include:

-   the primary importance of the weekly communion service
-   the communion is not led or administered by a single individual
-   the freedom and the responsibility for men to vocally
    participate in services
-   the silence of women (whose heads must be covered during
    meetings of the local church) in most Plymouth Brethren assemblies
-   the importance of preaching the gospel
-   the rejection of a separation of believers into clergy and
    laity classes, and
-   the plurality of leadership (usually as elders and deacons) as
    opposed to an ordained, professional clergy class.

[Baptism](Baptism "Baptism") and [communion](Communion "Communion")
are the only two ordinances. All assemblies adhere to the practice
of full immersion baptism, and most require it before participation
in the Lord's Supper. Sharing the exact beliefs of a local assembly
may be a necessary condition for fellowship in some local
assemblies, though this condition is much less common in Open
assemblies. Some Exclusive Brethen practice household baptism.
