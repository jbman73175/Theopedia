**Polemics** refers to the practice of challenging and refuting
[doctrinal](Doctrine "Doctrine") errors or providing correctives
within the same belief system (or religion). This may be contrasted
with [apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics") which attempts to
defend one's beliefs to outsiders. Polemics, therefore, may be
viewed as dialogue internal to Christianity, and apologetics as
dialogue to defend Christianity to non-Christians.

The
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers")
are sometimes categorized as either polemicists or apologists based
on the thrust of their writings.
