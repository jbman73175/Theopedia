**Polytheism** is belief in, or worship of, *multiple gods* or
divinities. The word comes from the Greek words poly+theoi,
literally "many gods." Most ancient religions were polytheistic,
holding to pantheons of traditional deities, often accumulated over
centuries of cultural interchange and experience. Present-day
polytheistic religions include [Hinduism](Hinduism "Hinduism"),
[Shinto](index.php?title=Shinto&action=edit&redlink=1 "Shinto (page does not exist)"),
some forms of
[Wicca](index.php?title=Wicca&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wicca (page does not exist)"),
Vodun, and Asatru. Buddhism is regarded by some non-practitioners
as polytheistic although this view of the religion is rejected by
most adherents. Some Jewish and Islamic scholars regard the
Christian doctrine of the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") as bordering
on polytheism, a view that Christians strongly reject.

However, there are some serious philosophical problems when
thinking about the definition of [God](God "God") in relation to
polytheistic beliefs. By the broadest definition in most
dictionaries, *God* refers to the supreme being that is above
everything else. By very definition, this requires that it be only
One being. The reasoning is that if this being was just another one
of many gods, He would *not* necessarily be the *highest* or
*supreme*. A polytheist might reply that there is one highest God
with multiple lesser gods (i.e.
[Henotheism](Henotheism "Henotheism")). However, this is still in
contrast to the definition because those lesser beings cannot be
referred to as "God", simply because they are not the
*supreme being*. The definition of a *supreme* God demands that He
is One.
