**Pornography**, sometimes called **porn** or **porno**, is the
explicit portrayal of the human body with the aim of sexual
arousal.

"Do you know why there are no windows on adult bookstores? Or do
you know why there are no windows on certain kinds of night clubs
in the city? And I suppose your answer would be, 'they don't want
people looking in and getting a free sight.' That's not the only
reason. You know why? Because they don't want people looking out at
the sky. You know why? The sky is the enemy of lust. Now I just ask
you... think back on your struggles. The sky is a great power
against lust. Pure, lovely, wholesome, beautiful, powerful,
large-hearted things cannot abide in the soul with a sexual fantasy
at the same time." - John Piper
