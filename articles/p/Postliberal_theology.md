**Postliberal theology**, or **postliberalism** is a movement in
contemporary theology that "rejects both the Enlightenment appeal
to a 'universal rationality' and the liberal assumption of an
immediate religious experience common to all humanity."
^[[1]](#note-0)^

The movement initially began in the 1980's with its association to
Yale Divinity School. Theologians such as
[Hans Frei](Hans_Frei "Hans Frei"), Paul Holmer, David Kelsey, and
[George Lindbeck](George_Lindbeck "George Lindbeck") were
influential and were significantly influenced by theologians such
as [Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth"), Clifford Geertz, and
Ludwig Wittgenstein.

Postliberalism uses a narrative approach to theology, such as
developed by Hans Frei, and argues that "all thought and experience
is historically and socially mediated... Postliberalism is thus
*anti-foundational* (in that it rejects the notion of a universal
foundation of knowledge), *communitarian* (in that it appeals to
the values, experiences, and language of a community, rather than
prioritizing the individual), and *historicist* (in that it insists
upon the importance of tradition and their associated historical
communities in the shaping of experience and thought."
