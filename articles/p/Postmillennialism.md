"The **postmillennialist** believes that the millennium is an era
(not necessarily a literal thousand years) during which Christ will
reign over the earth, not from a literal and earthly throne, but
through the gradual increase of the Gospel and its power to change
lives. After this gradual Christianization of the world, Christ
will return and immediately usher the church into their eternal
state after judging the wicked. This is called postmillennialism
because, by its view, Christ will return after the millennium."

## Contrast with Premillennialism

"In contrast to
[premillennialism](Premillennialism "Premillennialism"), the
postmillennialists emphasize the present aspects of God's kingdom,
which will reach fruition in the future. They believe that the
millennium will come through Christian preaching and teaching. Such
activity will result in a more godly, peaceful, and prosperous
world. The new age will not be essentially different from the
present, and it will come about as more people are converted to
Christ. Evil will not be totally eliminated during the millennium,
but it will be reduced to a minimum as the moral and spiritual
influence of Christians is increased."^[[2]](#note-1)^
