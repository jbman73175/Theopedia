**Postmodernism** is a relativistic system of observation and
thought that denies absolutes and objectivity. While no consensus
exists on a precise definition, postmodernism nevertheless signals
a dissatisfaction with one or more aspects of
[modernity](Modernity "Modernity"). Its origins are found in the
philosophies of Nietzsche, Heidegger, Marx and Freud. On some
points, particularly its attitude to truth, it is similar to New
Age thinking.

## Terminology

There are various terms used to describe this cultural phenomenon,
and they each have technical and more popular definitions.

### Postmodern Era

The *Postmodern Era* refers to this modern context that we find
ourselves in. Regardless of whether one is a postmodernist, one
does live in the time period of postmodernism and is affected by it
on every level whether they give into its demands or not. Everyone
living in the twenty-first century is living in the Postmodern
Era.

In a general sense, "this new era has been characterised by a
rejection of absolute truths and grand narratives explaining the
progressive evolution of society. At the same time it has brought
to the surface a multitude of different perspectives on society and
an appreciation of different cultures. It has highlighted
globalisation on the one hand and localisation on the other, the
celebration of difference and the search for
commonality."^[[1]](#note-0)^

### Postmodern*ism*

-   "Postmodernism is *post* because it is denies the existence of
    any ultimate principles, and it lacks the optimism of there being a
    scientific, philosophical, or religious truth which will explain
    everything for everybody - a characterisitic of the so-called
    *modern* mind. The paradox of the postmodern position is that, in
    placing all principles under the scrutiny of its skepticism, it
    must realize that even its own principles are not beyond
    questioning."
    [[1]](http://www.pbs.org/faithandreason/gengloss/postm-body.html)
-   A movement undertaken by those who seek various means of escape
    from the classic criticisms of [modernism](Modernism "Modernism").
-   A reaction against [modernism](Modernism "Modernism").

## Reactions to the Postmodern Era

### Evangelical reactions

There seem to be two extremes as far as evangelical reactions to
the Postmodern Era. One is full or significant embracing of it as
we see in the Emerging Church, and another is full rejection of it
in a desire to bring back the glory days of a previous era.

#### The Emerging Church

The [Emerging Church](Emerging_Church "Emerging Church") movement
seeks to revitalize the Christian church beyond what it sees as the
confines of modernity, so that it can effectively engage people in
a postmodern age. Critics allege, however, that this movement's
relativizing of faith has led many of its adherents outside of the
bounds of orthodoxy. [Brian McLaren](Brian_McLaren "Brian McLaren")
is a prominent author and spokesperson for this movement.

#### A Desire to Return to the Premodern or Modern Eras

Some that grew up in the
[Premodern](index.php?title=Premodern&action=edit&redlink=1 "Premodern (page does not exist)")
or
[Modern Eras](index.php?title=Modern_Era&action=edit&redlink=1 "Modern Era (page does not exist)")
may see the limitations of the Postmodern Era and feel a desire to
go back to that way of thinking. The only problem with this is that
each era has problems of its own, and in the Modern Era is when
communism and Marxism arose. The goal should not simply be to
return to particular *ism*, but to return to a Biblical
[worldview](Worldview "Worldview").

## Criticisms

"Faced with such opposition and the pressure it brings,
postmodernism is a form of intellectual pacifism that, at the end
of the day, recommends backgammon while the barbarians are at the
gate. It is the easy, cowardly way out that removes the pressure to
engage alternative conceptual schemes, to be different, to risk
ridicule, to take a stand outside the gate. But it is precisely as
disciples of Christ, even more, as officers in his army, that the
pacifist way out is simply not an option. However comforting it may
be, postmodernism is the cure that kills the patient, the military
strategy that concedes defeat before the first shot is fired, the
ideology that undermines its own claim to allegiance. And it is an
immoral, coward's way out that is not worthy of a movement born out
of the martyrs' blood,"
([J.P. Moreland](J.P._Moreland "J.P. Moreland"), "Truth,
Contemporary Philosophy and the Postmodern Turn", p. 88, *JETS*,
March 2005, 48:1)
