## To God alone

[R. C. Sproul](R._C._Sproul "R. C. Sproul") explains that "prayer
is to be addressed to God alone, either to God as Triune or to the
distinct persons of the Godhead. To pray to creatures is
[idolatry](Idolatry "Idolatry"),"
(*Essentials of the Christian Faith*, p. 192).

## Relationship with God's sovereignty

"The Scripture teaches both the sovereign foreordination of God and
the efficacy of prayer. The two are not inconsistent with one
another, for God ordains the means as well as the ends for His
divine purposes. Prayer is a means God uses to bring His sovereign
will to pass." (Sproul, p. 192).
