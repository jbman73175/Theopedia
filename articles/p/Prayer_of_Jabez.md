## Related passage

Now Jabez was more honorable than his brothers, and his mother
called his name Jabez, saying, "Because I bore him in pain." And
Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, "Oh, that You would bless
me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with
me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause
pain!" So God granted him what he requested, (1 Chronicles 4:9-10).
## Bruce Wilkinson's book

A recent popular book of the same name by Bruce Wilkinson, based on
this single biblical prayer, was published in 2000.

"Bruce Wilkinson was a guest on James Dobson's Focus on the Family
radio program in early-March of 2001. Referring to Wilkinson's
latest book (at the time), *The Prayer of Jabez*, Dobson claimed
that it had sold one million copies in February 2001 alone, and the
book's official Internet web site then claimed that sales totaled
nine million, with more than 13 million in print. It was a USA
Today/New York Times/Washington Post/Publisher's Weekly number one
bestseller, and is being embraced by Evangelicals, Catholics,
Fundamentalists, and even non-Christians. It won the Book of the
Year ECPA Gold Medallion Award. Bill Gothard, who was recently
asked to write a book on why the Jabez prayer works, said, "Because
it's a cry, not a prayer, and crying is more powerful."

In the book Wilkinson claims that if we'll just pray the prayer of
Jabez, word-for-word, every day for a month, then we'll see God's
power released in our lives, (*Jabez*, p. 11, p. 86). Critics
suggest that to Wilkinson, the key isn't God's choice to answer
Jabez's prayer. The key is that Jabez stumbled upon the right
formula for asking things of God. Wilkinson reverses the cause and
effect and implies that Jabez was honorable because he figured out
the right way to pray. Wilkinson's emphasis is on Jabez finding the
correct method, instead of on God and His Sovereignty.
