Traditional liturgies such as those of the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic"),
[Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran"), and
[Anglican](Anglican "Anglican") churches include communal
**prayers confessing sin**. Although these do not replace the
personal [confessions](Confession_of_Sins "Confession of Sins")
that each believer is called to make to the Lord as part of the
[repentance cycle](index.php?title=Repentance_cycle&action=edit&redlink=1 "Repentance cycle (page does not exist)"),
many find them helpful in "placing souls in a right relationship"
or "remembering who we are before the living God," in preparation
for worship.

Note the following in the prayers:

-   the first and third prayers ask forgiveness both for sins of
    commission and for sins of omission;
-   the first two prayers include a movement from confession
    (admission of guilt) to repentance (choosing a more faithful life)
-   the second prayer begins, as does the
    [Lord's Prayer](Lord's_Prayer "Lord's Prayer"), with an affirmation
    of who God is â€” verbally exhalting him. Worshippers speaking these
    words cannot easily hold onto any residual sense of self-importance
    or self-pride.

## Anglican Confession for Morning Prayer

This prayer, from the service of *Morning Prayer* in the Anglican
[Book of Common Prayer](Book_of_Common_Prayer "Book of Common Prayer"),
is read aloud by the officiant and all members of the congregation
near the beginning of the service, and is followed by a prayer of
[absolution](index.php?title=Absolution&action=edit&redlink=1 "Absolution (page does not exist)").
The service of Morning Prayer was traditionally said by all clergy,
every day and often by themselves, as part of their "daily office."
Many clergy no longer maintain this discipline.

Almighty and most merciful Father, we have erred and strayed from
thy ways like lost sheep, we have followed too much the devices and
desires of our own hearts, we have offended against thy holy laws,
we have left undone those things which we ought to have done, and
we have done those things which we ought not to have done; and
there is no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us,
miserable offenders. Spare thou them, O God, which confess their
faults. Restore thou them that are penitent; According to thy
promises declared unto mankind in Christ Jesu our Lord. And grant,
O most merciful Father, for his sake, That we may hereafter live a
godly, righteous, and sober life, To the glory of thy holy Name.
Amen. [[1]](http://www.prayerbook.ca/bcp/morning_prayer.html)
## Anglican Confession for Holy Communion

This prayer is also from the Anglican
[Book of Common Prayer](Book_of_Common_Prayer "Book of Common Prayer"),
but in this case from the service of *Holy Communion.* It too is
read aloud by the officiant and all members of the congregation as
part of the preparation for celebrating communion, and is also
followed by a prayer of
[absolution](index.php?title=Absolution&action=edit&redlink=1 "Absolution (page does not exist)").

Almighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things,
Judge of all men: we acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and
wickedness, which we from time to time most grievously have
committed, by thought, word, and deed, against thy Divine Majesty.
We do earnestly repent, and are heartily sorry for these our
misdoings. Have mercy upon us, most merciful Father; for thy Son
our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, forgive us all that is past; and
grant that we may ever hereafter serve and please thee in newness
of life, to the honour and glory of thy Name; Through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen.

## Roman Catholic *Confiteor*

The **Confiteor** is the Catholic prayer of confession used at the
beginning of the communion service (the "Mass") and in other
services. The first recorded instance of this prayer in this
context is in *Micrologus* by Bernold of Constance, in the eleventh
century. For centuries the prayer was known only in its original
Latin form, which is reproduced here, and the phrase "mea culpa"
("it is my fault") has entered into general English usage.

The Roman Catholic practice of addressing
[prayers to Mary](Mariology "Mariology") and the Saints stems from
[church tradition](Tridentine_Creed "Tridentine Creed") and is not
defensible within biblical theology.

### English

I confess to almighty God, and to you my brothers and sisters, that
I have sinned through my own fault, in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and what I have failed to do. I ask blessed
Mary ever Virgin, all the angels and saints, and you my brothers
and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God. Amen.

### Latin

Confiteor Deo omnipotenti, et vobis fratres, quia peccavi nimis
cogitatione, verbo opere et omissione: mea culpa, mea culpa, mea
maxima culpa. deo precor beatam Mariam semper Virginem, omnes
angelos et Sanctos, orare pro me ad Dominum Deum nostrum. Amen.
