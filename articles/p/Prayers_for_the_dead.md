**Prayers for the dead** is a practice accepted and endorsed in
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") and generally
rejected by [Protestants](Protestantism "Protestantism"). The Roman
doctrine finds a basis in
[2 Maccabees](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Maccabees "wikipedia:2 Maccabees")
(xii, 40-46) and is inextricably tied to its doctrine of
[purgatory](Purgatory "Purgatory"). With the exclusion of some High
Church Anglicans, Protestantism deems prayers for the dead useless,
as Hebrews 9:27 states: "And as it is appointed unto men once to
die, but after this the judgment" (KJV).
