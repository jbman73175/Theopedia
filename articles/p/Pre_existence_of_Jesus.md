"The **preexistence of Christ** is part of the foundation of
Christian faith on which these other
[doctrines](Doctrine "Doctrine") depend. It is a necessary premise
for belief in [Christ’s deity](Deity_of_Jesus "Deity of Jesus"),
but by itself it is not sufficient. Because
[Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ")’s preexistence is
foundational, how one understands it or rejects it affects the
remainder of [Christology](Christology "Christology") and one’s
overall understanding of
[Christianity](Christianity "Christianity"). This has been nowhere
more evident than in the modern attempts to explain (or explain
away) the doctrine. Those modern
[theologians](Theologian "Theologian") who ignore or deny Christ’s
preexistence do so because it is incompatible with their
understanding either of
[his humanity](Humanity_of_Jesus "Humanity of Jesus") or of the
nature of religion." (McCready,
*He came down from Heaven": The Preexistence of Christ Revisited*,
p. 419)
