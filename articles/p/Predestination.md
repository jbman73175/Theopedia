**Predestination** in its broadest conception is the
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") that because [God](God "God") is
[all-powerful](Omnipotence_of_God "Omnipotence of God"),
[all-knowing](Omniscience_of_God "Omniscience of God"), and
[completely sovereign](Sovereignty_of_God "Sovereignty of God"), he
"from all eternity did by the most wise and holy counsel of His own
will, freely and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass,"
([Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")).
"In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined
according to the purpose of him who works all things according to
the counsel of his will" (Ephesians 1:11).

## Predestination in the OT

The OT doctrine of predestination is most vivid in God's choice of
Israel to be a light to those around them (Isaiah 42:6; 49:6).
Moses, speaking of Israel, says of them,

For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God
has chosen you to be a people for his treasured possession, out of
all the peoples who are on the face of the earth. It was not
because you were more in number than any other people that the LORD
set his love on you and chose you, for you were the fewest of all
peoples, but it is because the LORD loves you and is keeping the
oath that he swore to your fathers, that the LORD has brought you
out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery,
from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt (Deuteronomy 7:6-8).
It is important to note that God chose them to be a "treasured
possession, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the
earth," not because they "were more in number than any other
people" but because the LORD loved them and is keeping the oath
that he swore to his fathers. Also, from the context, it is clear
that Israel was involved in God's plan, but so was Egypt. God
hardened Pharoah's heart so that he would refuse to let them go
(Exodus 3:19; 7:13; 14:13). Thus, from the beginning of history,
the predestined plan of God is evident in the redemption of his
people.

The OT writers viewed history as occuring in God's sovereign and
predestined plan. The entire idea of
[prophecy](Prophecy "Prophecy") rests upon this truth. If God does
not sovereignly control and predestine whatever comes to pass then
how he could make statements that are predictive and expect
specific results in the future?

## Predestination in the NT

The NT in no way differs from the OT teaching of predestination.
The coming of Jesus, his death,
[resurrection](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus"),
[ascension](Ascension_of_Jesus "Ascension of Jesus") into
[heaven](Heaven "Heaven"), all fulfilled God's eternal plan and
purpose (1 Peter 1:20; 1 Corinthians 2:7; Acts 2:23). Scripture
clearly says that,

"for truly in this city there were gathered together against your
holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius
Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do
whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place
(Acts 4:27-28 [ESV](ESV "ESV")).
Some are uncomfortable with the fact that the work of Jesus Christ
was in fact predestined, however, this is clearly what Scripture
teaches. Furthermore, [Paul](Paul "Paul") teaches that Christians
have "have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined
according to the purpose of him who works all things according to
the counsel of his will," (Ephesians 1:11 [ESV](ESV "ESV")).
Predestination is thus according to the purpose of God, or
[his will](Will_of_God "Will of God").   
In other places in the NT, predestination has to do with those who
were *chose(n)* (Mark 13:20), including [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")
(Matthew 12:18). Elsewhere, it is summed up in such passages as
Romans 8:28-30, chapters 9-11, and Ephesians 1:1-12. In these
statements, Paul is clear that God ordains all acts, even in the
case of Pharaoh, sinful acts of humanity. In Paul's mind,
everything exists and happens in accordance with God's
predetermined plan and sovereign purpose -(Ephesians 1:11). Lastly,
in Romans 9:17-23, Paul anticipates the expected question, "Why
does he still find fault? For who can resist his will? (v. 19). He
then provides the answer, "But who are you O man, to answer back to
God? Will what is molded say to its molder, 'Why have you made me
like this?' Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of
the same lump one vessel for honored use and another for
dishonorable use?" (vv. 20-22). For many, this is not the answer
they are looking for. Yet, this is the answer that Scripture
supplies. The doctrine of predestination cannot be completely
understood, for it is an act that resides in the mind of an
infinite being, and we, as finite humans, cannot understand this
(see
[knowability of God](Knowability_of_God "Knowability of God")).

## Predestination and salvation

[Calvinists](Calvinism "Calvinism") and
[Arminians](Arminianism "Arminianism") agree that only some are
chosen for salvation, and that those who are elect will come to
faith and believe until the end. Further, both viewpoints agree
that those who turn from [sin](Sin "Sin") to follow
[Christ](Christ "Christ") are saved. The question is this: On what
basis did God predestine people? Did God predestine some because He
knew they would believe of their own free will, or did He
predestine without regard to human choices? Was God's choice based
on man's choice, or is man's choice itself a result of God's
choice?

According to [John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"),

"Predestination we call the eternal decree of God, by which He has
determined in Himself, what He would have to become of every
individual of mankind. For they are not all created with a similar
destiny; but eternal life is foreordained for some and eternal
death for others. Every man, therefore, being created for one or
the other of these ends, we say he is predestinated either to life
or to death," (*Institutes*, Book III, Ch. XXI, Sec. 5).
## Double predestination

The term **double predestination** has been used to refer to the
dual concepts of election and
[reprobation](Reprobation "Reprobation") in Reformed theology. This
is largely a pejorative term which leads to misconceptions of the
Calvinist (or Reformed) doctrine. It has been used as a synonym for
a "symmetrical" view of predestination which sees election and
reprobation being worked out in an *equally* parallel mode of
divine operation.

The distortion of double predestination suggests a parallelism of
foreordination and predestination by means of a positive symmetry,
which may be called a positive-positive view of predestination.
This is, God positively and actively intervenes in the lives of the
elect to bring them to salvation; and in the same way God
positively and actively intervenes in the life of the reprobate to
bring him to sin.

This distortion makes God the author of sin who punishes a person
for doing what God monergistically and irresistibly moves man to
do. This is not the Reformed view of predestination, but a gross
and inexcusable caricature of the doctrine. Such a view may be
identified with what is often loosely described as
[Hyper-Calvinism](Hyper-Calvinism "Hyper-Calvinism") and involves a
radical form of
[supralapsarianism](Supralapsarianism "Supralapsarianism"). Such a
view of predestination has been virtually universally and
monolithically rejected by Reformed thinkers.

The classic position of Reformed theology views predestination as
double in that it involves both election and reprobation but *not*
symmetrical with respect to the mode of divine activity. A strict
parallelism of operation is denied. Rather predestination is viewed
in terms of a positive-negative relationship.

In the Reformed view God from all eternity decrees some to election
and positively intervenes in their lives to work regeneration and
faith by a monergistic work of grace. To the non-elect God
withholds this monergistic work of grace, passing them by and
leaving them to themselves. He does not monergistically work sin or
unbelief in their lives. Thus, the mode of operation in the lives
of the elect is not parallel with that operation in the lives of
the reprobate. God works regeneration monergistically but never
sin.

## Quotes

"Scripture is the school of the Holy Spirit, in which, as nothing
is omitted that is both necessary and useful to know, so nothing is
taught but what is expedient to know. Therefore we must guard
against depriving believers of anything disclosed about
predestination in Scripture, lest we seem either wickedly to
defraud them of the blessing of their God or to accuse and scoff at
the Holy Spirit for having published what is in any way profitable
to suppress... But for those who are so cautious or fearful that
they desire to bury predestination in order not to disturb weak
souls - with what color will they cloak their arrogance when they
accuse God indirectly of stupid thoughtlessness as if he had not
forseen the peril that they feel they have wisely met? Whoever,
then, heaps odium upon the doctrine of predestination openly
reproaches God, as if he had unadvisedly let slip something hurtful
to the Church. - [John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"),
*Institutes of the Christian Religion*, III.xxi.3, 4
