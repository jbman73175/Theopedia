**Premillennialism** teaches that the
[Second coming](Second_coming "Second coming") will occur before a
literal thousand-year reign of Christ from Jerusalem upon the
earth. In the early church, premillennialism was called *chiliasm*,
from the Greek term meaning *1,000*, a word used six times in
Revelation 20:2-7. This view is most often contrasted with
[Postmillennialism](Postmillennialism "Postmillennialism") which
sees Christ's return *after* a golden "millennial age" where Christ
rules spiritually from his throne in heaven, and
[Amillennialism](Amillennialism "Amillennialism") which sees the
millennium as a figurative reference to the current church age.

## Background

Premillennialism was the most widely held view of the earliest
centuries of the church. Philip Schaff has said, "The most striking
point in the eschatology of the ante-Nicene Age (A.D. 100-325) is
the prominent *chiliasm*, or *millenarianism*, . . . a widely
current opinion of distinguished teachers, such as Barnabas, Papia,
Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Methodius, and Lactantius."
(*History of the Christian Church*, Scribner, 1884; Vol. 2, p.
614)

Premillennialism began to die out in the established Catholic
Church during the life of Augustine (A.D. 354-430). Chiliasm was
suppressed by the dominant Catholic Church, but survived through
various "fringe" groups of Christians during the mediaeval period.
During the Reformation, Anabaptists and Hugenots helped to revive
premillennialism and it was adopted among some Puritans during the
Post-Reformation era.

The greatest development and spread of premillennialism since the
early church came in the late 1800's - early 1900's with the rise
of U.S. Fundamentalism and
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism").
Starting in the British Isles and spreading to America,
premillennialism (in its dispensational form) has become prominent
in the Evangelical faith.

## Two varieties of premillennialism

Premillennialists fall into two primary categories:
**historic premillennialism** and
**dispensational premillennialism**. Historic premillennialism is
so called because it is the classic form which may be found in
writings of some of the
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers")
(mentioned above), although in an undeveloped form. Dispensational
premillennialism is that form which derives from John Nelson Darby
(1800-1882) and
[dispensational](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") theology.
It is dispensational premillenialism that first taught the notion
of a pre-tribulation [rapture](Rapture "Rapture").

Historic premillennialists reject the idea of a pre-tribulation
[rapture](Rapture "Rapture") and the uniquely Jewish nature of the
dispensationalist's millennial kingdom (see below). It is often
assumed that all premillennialists are dispensational in their
theology. This is a confusion that should be avoided. Historic
premillennialists such as
[George Eldon Ladd](George_Eldon_Ladd "George Eldon Ladd") are
consistent [Calvinists](Calvinism "Calvinism") who did not accept
the basic tenets of dispensationalism.

## Uniqueness of dispensational premillennialism

Classic dispensationalists (ala
[C. I. Scofield](C._I._Scofield "C. I. Scofield") and Lewis Sperry
Chafer) are pre-tribulationists and believe that the
[second coming](Second_coming "Second coming") will be in two
stages separated by a 7-year period of tribulation. At the first he
will return in the air to rescue those who are Christians at that
time (the [rapture](Rapture "Rapture")). Then follows a seven-year
period of suffering in which the Antichrist will conquer the world
and kill those who refuse to worship him. At the end of the seven
years, the final witness will go out before men and angels and
Christ will return to the earth. He will defeat the Antichrist, and
rescue the Jews and those who have converted to Christianity during
the tribulation period.

Dispensationalism has also spawned Mid-tribulationists who believe
that Christians will not be removed until 3-1/2 years of the final
seven years have elapsed. They place the Rapture when the Temple
sacrifices have been halted and the Antichrist has enshrined
himself in the Temple, calling himself God.

By contrast, historic premillennialists would be generally
categorized as "Post-tribulationists" because they see no
appreciable difference in the timing of the rapture and the
"official" second coming. Thus they hold that Christ will not
return until the end of the Great tribulation and that Christians
will suffer for the faith as they bring forth the final witness
associated with the 5th seal of the book of Revelation.

The belief in the pretribulation or midtribulation rapture theories
of dispensationalism is often criticized, on the grounds that it
results in the division of Christ's single return into two stages.
Some see it as an impossible "apartheid of the Elect" of sorts
which is not seen in Scripture. Pretribulationists defend it on the
basis of a Scripture passage which affirms that God has not
appointed His people to wrath and the promise to the Philadelphian
church: "I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is
about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that
dwell upon the earth." Post-tribulationists counter that the
tribulation associated with the final witness of the saints is in
no way connected to the wrath of God. This wrath of God will only
only come at the last day and it will fall upon the heads of the
wicked at the last judgment.

Some specifically criticize dispensational premillennialism for its
uniquely Jewish character of the
[Millennial Kingdom](Millennial_Kingdom "Millennial Kingdom").
Specifically for anticipating the rebuilding of the Hebrew Temple
and the offering again of animal sacrifices during the millennial
reign of Christ. In dispensationalism, the return of the sacrifices
will be ceremonial in nature. Like the ceremony of Communion or the
Lord's Supper they believe that the sacrifices will be performed on
the appointed feast days in the future Millennium. They say that
the reason the animal sacrifices will continue is because they will
be enacted as a memorial to the Savior who came to earth as the
Sacrifice Lamb. However, critics view the idea of blood sacrifices
re-instututed after Christ's return as incompatible with Christ's
completed work and find the idea abhorrent (O. T. Allis,
*Prophecy and the Church*, p.248).
