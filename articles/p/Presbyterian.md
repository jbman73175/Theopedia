**Presbyterian** refers to a branch of Protestant denominations
derived from the Reformed churches of the Reformantion, which have
a presbyterian form of church governance. Presbyterian churches are
historically [calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") in theology.
Presbyterianism traces its institutional roots back to the Scottish
Reformation, especially as led by
[John Knox](John_Knox "John Knox"). There are many separate
Presbyterian Churches around the world. Besides national
distinctions, Presbyterians also have divided from one another for
doctrinal reasons, especially in the wake of the
[Enlightenment](Enlightenment "Enlightenment").

## History of Presbyterianism

These denominations derive their name from the Greek word
*presbuteros*, which means "[elder](Elder "Elder")." Presbyterian
church governance is common to the Protestant churches that were
most closely modelled after the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation") in Switzerland. In
England, Scotland and Ireland, the Reformed churches that adopted a
presbyterian instead of [episcopalian](Episcopalian "Episcopalian")
government became known, naturally enough, as the Presbyterian
Church.

In Scotland, [John Knox](John_Knox "John Knox") (1505-1572), who
had studied under Calvin in Geneva, returned to Scotland and led
the Parliament of Scotland to embrace the Reformation in 1560. The
existing
[Church of Scotland](index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland&action=edit&redlink=1 "Church of Scotland (page does not exist)")
was thus reformed along Presbyterian lines. In Ireland the
Presbyterian Church was formed from the Church of Scotland and
later became the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. In England,
Presbyterianism was established in secret in 1572, toward the end
of the reign of Elizabeth I of England. In 1647, by an act of the
Long Parliament under the control of
[Puritans](Puritans "Puritans"), the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England") embraced
Presbyterianism. The re-establishment of the monarchy in 1660
brought the return of [episcopalian](Episcopalian "Episcopalian")
church government in England (and in Scotland for a short time);
but the Presbyterian church in England continued in non-conformity,
outside of the established church. In Ireland, Presbyterianism was
introduced by Scottish immigrants and missionaries to Ulster. The
Presbytery of Ulster was formed separately from the established
church, in 1642. Presbyterians, along with Roman Catholics in
Ulster and the rest of Ireland, suffered under the discriminatory
Penal Laws until they were revoked in the early 19th century. All
three, very diverse branches of Presbyterianism, as well as
independents, and some Dutch, German, and French Reformed
denominations, combined in America to form what would eventually
become the Presbyterian Church USA (1706). The Presbyterian church
in England and Wales is the United Reformed Church, whilst the
tradition also influenced the [Methodist](Methodist "Methodist")
church, established in 1736.

Because of an emphasis on equal education for all people,
Presbyterians have 'planted' and encouraged schools across the US
as the country grew and the missionaries were sent out to the
people.

## Characteristics of Presbyterians

Presbyterians distinguish themselves from other denominations by
both doctrine and institutional organization, or as they prefer to
call it 'church order'. The origins of the Presbyterian churches
were in [Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"), which is no longer
emphasized in some of the contemporary branches. Many of the
branches of Presbyterianism are remnants of previous splits from
larger groups. These splits have been caused by disagreement
concerning the degree to which those ordained to church office
should be required to agree with the Calvinistic
[Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")
of Faith, which historically serves as the main constitutional
document of Presbyterian churches. Those groups that adhere to the
document most strictly are typified by baptism of the infant
children of believers, the exclusive use of
[Psalms](Psalms "Psalms") (modified for metrical singing), singing
unaccompanied by instruments, a common
[communion](Communion "Communion") cup, only men are eligible for
ordination to any church office, and a fully Calvinist doctrine of
salvation. Because of this diversity of belief, more conservative
Presbyterians are likely to attend the smaller denominations that
have chosen to split from a larger body. While these conservative
Presbyterians are not in the majority, their numbers are
significant.

### Church Governance

Presbyterian government is based on Elders. Teaching and ruling
elders are ordained and convene as a 'Kirk Session', (commonly
refered to as simply 'session') responsible for the discipline,
nurture and mission of the local
[congregation](Congregation "Congregation"). Usually, especially in
larger congregations, the practicalities of buildings, finance and
temporal ministry to the needy in the congregation are delegated to
a distinct group of officers (sometimes called deacons - and in
some denominations ordained). This group may variously be known as
a 'Board', 'Diaconate' or 'Deacons' Court'. Teaching elders
(ministers) have responsibility for teaching, worship and
performing sacraments. Ministers are called by individual
congregations. A congregation issues a call for the minister's
service, but this call must be ratified by the Presbytery.

Above the Kirk Sessions exist Presbyteries, which have area
responsibilities. These are composed of ministers and elders from
each of the constituent congregations. The Presbytery sends
representatives to a broader regional assembly, generally known as
the **General Assembly**, although an intermediate level of a
**synod** sometimes exists. This congregation / presbytery / synod
/ general assembly schema is based on the historical structure of
the larger Presbyterian churches, like the Church of Scotland or
the Presbyterian Church (USA) ([PCUSA](http://www.pcusa.org)); some
of the smaller bodies, like the
[Presbyterian Church in America](Presbyterian_Church_in_America "Presbyterian Church in America"),
[Confederation of Reformed Evangelical Churches](index.php?title=Confederation_of_Reformed_Evangelical_Churches&action=edit&redlink=1 "Confederation of Reformed Evangelical Churches (page does not exist)")
([CREC](http://www.crechurches.org)), or the
[Presbyterian Church in Ireland](index.php?title=Presbyterian_Church_in_Ireland&action=edit&redlink=1 "Presbyterian Church in Ireland (page does not exist)")
skip one of the steps between congregation and General Assembly,
and usually the step skipped is the Synod. The
[Church of Scotland](index.php?title=Church_of_Scotland&action=edit&redlink=1 "Church of Scotland (page does not exist)")
has now abolished the Synod.

### Doctrine

Presbyterianism is historically a confessional tradition, which
means that the doctrines taught in the church are compared to a
doctrinal standard. However, there has arisen a spectrum of
approaches to "confessionalism". The manner of *subscription*, or
the degree to which the official standards establish the actual
doctrine of the church, turns out to be a practical matter. That
is, the decisions rendered in ordination and in the courts of the
church largely determine what the church means, representing the
whole, by its adherence to the doctrinal standard.

Some Presbyterian traditions adopt only the
[Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")
of Faith, as the doctrinal standard to which ministers are required
to subscribe, in contrast to the Larger and Shorter catechisms,
which are approved for use in instruction. Many Presbyterian
denominations, especially in North America, have adopted all of the
Westminster Standards as their standard of doctrine "subordinate to
the Bible". These documents are
[Calvinistic](Calvinist "Calvinist") in their doctrinal
orientation, although some versions of the *Confession* and the
catechisms are more overtly Calvinist than some other, later
American revisions. The PCUSA has adopted the Book of Confessions,
which reflects an embrace of the wider Reformed tradition, and
includes the *Westminster* documents.

In the PCUSA, the Confessing Movement works to coordinate
congregations that seek to interpret the Book of Confessions in a
more "conservative", Evangelical or even Calvinistic manner, in
their doctrines and judicial
decisions.[1](index.php?title=1&action=edit&redlink=1 "1 (page does not exist)")
The other end of the spectrum, which seeks to interpret the
constitution of the church in a much more "progressive" and
inclusive manner, is represented by the Covenant Network.

## Varieties of Presbyterianism in North America

Even before Presbyterianism spread abroad from Scotland there were
divisions in the larger Presbyterian family, some of which later
rejoined only to separate again. In rueful self-reproach some
Presbyterians refer to the divided Presbyterian churches as the
"Split P's".

In North America, because of past doctrinal differences,
Presbyterian churches often overlap, with congregations of many
different Presbyterian groups in any one city. The largest
Presbyterian denomination in the United States is the Presbyterian
Church (USA) ([PCUSA](http://www.pcusa.org)). Other Presbyterian
bodies in the United States include the
[Presbyterian Church in America](Presbyterian_Church_in_America "Presbyterian Church in America")
(PCA), the
[Orthodox Presbyterian Church](Orthodox_Presbyterian_Church "Orthodox Presbyterian Church")
(OPC), the Evangelical Presbyterian Church
([EPC](http://www.epc.org)), the Reformed Presbyterian Church, the
Bible Presbyterian Church (BPC), the Associate Reformed
Presbyterian Church (ARP Synod), the Cumberland Presbyterian
Church, the Confederation of Reformed Evangelical Churches
([CREC](http://www.crechurches.org)), and the Reformed Presbyterian
Church in the United States (RPCUS). In Canada, the largest
Presbyterian Church is the
[Presbyterian Church in Canada](index.php?title=Presbyterian_Church_in_Canada&action=edit&redlink=1 "Presbyterian Church in Canada (page does not exist)"),
about seventy percent of which merged in 1925 with the Methodist
Church, Canada, and the Congregational Union of Canada to form the
United Church of Canada.
