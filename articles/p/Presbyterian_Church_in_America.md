The **Presbyterian Church in America** (PCA) is the second largest
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") church body in the
United States after the
[Presbyterian Church (USA)](Presbyterian_Church_(USA) "Presbyterian Church (USA)").
The PCA has a strong commitment to
[evangelism](Evangelism "Evangelism"), missionary work, and
[Christian](Christian "Christian") education. From its inception,
the church has determined its purpose to be "faithful to the
Scriptures, true to the [Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") faith, and
obedient to the Great Commission."

## Background

In December, 1973, delegates from 260 congregations that had left
the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS), gathered at
Briarwood Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama, and organized
the National Presbyterian Church, which became the Presbyterian
Church in America in 1974. According to PCA's official website, it
"separated from the PCUS in opposition to the long-developing
theological liberalism which denied the deity of
[Jesus Christ](Jesus "Jesus") and the
[Inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy") and authority of
[Scripture](Bible "Bible").

In 1982, the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod,
joined the Presbyterian Church in America. The Reformed
Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod, had been formed in 1965 by
a merger of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church and the Reformed
Presbyterian Church in North America, General Synod.

The PCA has made a firm commitment to the Westminster Standards,
namely the
[Westminster Confession of Faith](Westminster_Confession_of_Faith "Westminster Confession of Faith"),
the
[Westminster Shorter Catechism](Westminster_Shorter_Catechism "Westminster Shorter Catechism"),
and the
[Westminster Larger Catechism](index.php?title=Westminster_Larger_Catechism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Westminster Larger Catechism (page does not exist)").

The denomination has its own college (Covenant College) and
seminary
([Covenant Theological Seminary](Covenant_Theological_Seminary "Covenant Theological Seminary")).
It shares control of a publication company, Great Commission
Publications, with its sister denomination, the
[Orthodox Presbyterian Church](Orthodox_Presbyterian_Church "Orthodox Presbyterian Church"),
and recently the PCA began publishing its own denominational
magazine, [*byFaith*](http://www.byfaithonline.com).
