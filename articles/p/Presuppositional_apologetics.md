**Presuppositional apologetics** is the "school of
[apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics") developed by
[Cornelius Van Til](Cornelius_Van_Til "Cornelius Van Til"). It
rejects [classical apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics"), and
insists that fruitful arguments establishing the truth of
Christianity can only be made by identifying a person's
presuppositions and having correct ones.

"Due to the
[noetic effects of sin](Noetic_effects_of_sin "Noetic effects of sin"),
presuppositionalists usually hold that there is not enough common
ground between believers and unbelievers that would allow followers
of the prior three methods to accomplish their goals. The apologist
must simply presuppose the truth of Christianity as the proper
starting point in apologetics. Here the Christian revelation in the
Scriptures is the framework through which all experience is
interpreted and all truth is known. Various evidences and arguments
can be advanced for the truth of Christianity, but these at least
implicitly presuppose premises that can be true only if
Christianity is true. Presuppositionalist attempt, then, to argue
transcendentally. That is, they argue that all meaning and thought
- indeed, every fact - logically presupposes the God of the
Scriptures.

"[John Frame](John_Frame "John Frame") represents
presuppositionalism in this volume, and he puts the matter this
way:
*[We] should present the biblical God, not merely as the conclusion to an argument, but as the one who makes argument possible*
(...). By demonstrating that unbelievers can not argue, think, or
live without presupposing God, presuppositionalists try to show
unbelievers that their own worldview is inadequate to explain their
experience of the world and to get unbelievers to see that
Christianity alone can mkae sense of their experience."
