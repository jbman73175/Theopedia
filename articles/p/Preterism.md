**Preterism** is a view in Christian
[eschatology](Eschatology "Eschatology") which holds that some or
all of the biblical prophecies concerning the *Last Days* refer to
events which took place in the first century after Christ's birth,
especially associated with the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD.
The term preterism comes from the Latin *praeter*, meaning *past*,
since this view deems certain biblical prophecies as *past*, or
already fulfilled.

Preterism is most dramatically contrasted with
[Futurism](index.php?title=Futurism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Futurism (page does not exist)"),
the view that most prophecies regarding the
[End times](End_times "End times"), and passages referring to
*Last Days*, *Great Tribulation*, and *Judgment* are still future
and will immediately precede the
[return of Christ](Second_Coming "Second Coming"). Proponents of
preterist views generally fall in one of two categories: *Partial*
Preterism or *Full* Preterism.

## Partial Preterists

Partial Preterism, the older of the two views, holds that
prophecies such as the destruction of Jerusalem, the
[Antichrist](Antichrist "Antichrist"), the Great Tribulation, and
the advent of the Day of the Lord as a "judgment-coming" of Christ
were fulfilled circa 70 AD when the Roman general (and future
Emperor) Titus sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Jewish Temple,
putting a permanent stop to the daily animal sacrifices. It
identifies "Babylon the great" (Revelation 17-18) with the ancient
pagan City of Rome or Jerusalem.

Most Partial Preterists also believe the term *Last Days* refers
not to the last days of planet Earth or the last days of humankind,
but rather to the last days of the Mosaic
[covenant](Covenant "Covenant") which God had exclusively with
national Israel until the year AD 70. As God came in judgment upon
various nations in the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament"), Christ also came in
judgment against those in Israel who rejected him. These
*last days*, however, are to be distinguished from the "last day,"
which is considered still future and entails the
[Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming") of Jesus, the
Resurrection of the righteous and unrighteous dead physically from
the grave in like-manner to Jesus' physical resurrection, the
[Final judgment](Final_judgment "Final judgment"), and the creation
of a literal (rather than covenantal) New Heavens and a New Earth,
free from the curse of sin and death which was brought about by
[the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall") of Adam and Eve.

Thus partial preterists are in agreement and conformity with the
historic
[ecumenical creeds](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils") of
the Church and articulate the doctrine of the resurrection held by
the
[Early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers").
Partial preterists hold that the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") predicts and depicts
many "comings" of Christ. They contend that the phrase
[Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming") means second of a
like kind in a series, for the Scriptures record other "comings"
even before the judgment-coming in 70 AD. This would eliminate the
70 AD event as the "second" of any series, let alone the second of
a series in which the earthly, physical ministry of Christ is the
first. Partial Preterists believe that the new creation comes in
redemptive progression as Christ reigns from His heavenly throne,
subjugating His enemies, and will eventually culminate in the
destruction of physical death, the "last enemy" (1 Cor 15:20-24).
If there are any enemies remaining, the resurrection event cannot
have occurred.

Nearly all Partial Preterists hold to
[amillennialism](Amillennialism "Amillennialism") or
[postmillennialism](Postmillennialism "Postmillennialism"). Many
postmillennial Partial Preterists are also
[theonomists](Theonomy "Theonomy") in their outlook.

Partial Preterism is generally considered to be an historic
orthodox interpretation as it affirms all items of the ecumenical
Creeds of the Church. However, Partial Preterism is not the
majority view among American protestant denominations and meets
with significant vocal opposition, especially by those which
espouse [Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism").
Additionally, concerns are expressed by Dispensationalists that
Partial Preterism logically leads to an acceptance of Full
Preterism, a concern which is denied by Partial Preterists.

## Full Preterism

Full Preterism differs from Partial Preterism in that it sees all
prophecy fulfilled with the destruction of Jerusalem, including the
resurrection of the dead and Jesus' Second Coming or Parousia. Full
Preterism is also known by other names, such as Consistent
Preterism or Hyper-Preterism (a somewhat derogatory term). A
related but more recent term is [Pantelism](Pantelism "Pantelism"),
which some regard as an extension of Full Preterism rather than the
same thing.

Full Preterism holds that Jesus'
[Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming") is to be viewed not
as a future-to-us bodily return, but rather a "return" manifested
by the physical destruction of Jerusalem and her Temple in AD 70 by
foreign armies in a manner similar to various Old Testament
descriptions of God coming to destroy other nations in righteous
judgment. Full Preterism also holds that the Resurrection of the
dead did not entail the raising of the physical body, but rather
the resurrection of the soul from the "place of the dead," known as
Sheol (Hebrew) or Hades (Greek). As such, the righteous dead
obtained a spiritual and substantial body for use in the heavenly
realm, and the unrighteous dead were cast into the Lake of Fire.
Some Full Preterists believe this judgment is ongoing and takes
effect upon the death of each individual (Heb. 9:27). The New
Heavens and the New Earth are also equated with the fulfillment of
the Law in AD 70 and are to be viewed in the same manner by which a
Christian is considered a "new creation" upon his or her
conversion.

Although Full Preterism is viewed as heretical by many, this
condemnation is not universal. Many of those who condemn Full
Preterism do so not based solely upon the historic creeds of the
church (which would exclude this view), but also from biblical
passages that they interpret to condemn a past view of the
Resurrection or the denial of a physical
resurrection/transformation of the body, doctrines which many
Christians (but not all) believe to be essential to the faith.
Critics of full preterism point to the Apostle Paul's condemnation
of the doctrine of Hymaneus and Philetus (2 Tim 2:17-18), which
they regard as analogous to full preterism.

Adherents of Full Preterism, however, dispute this assertion by
claiming that any biblical condemnation of a past resurrection was
written during a time in which the Resurrection was yet future
(i.e., pre-AD 70) as well as claiming different interpretations of
other proffered biblical passages. Furthermore, Full Preterists
reject the authority of the Creeds to condemn their view, stating
that the Creeds were written by uninspired and fallible men and are
simply in error on this point and need to be reformed. A growing
movement, there has been a strong push by Full Preterists for
acceptance as another valid Christian eschatological view; however,
to date, no major conservative denomination or group has officially
accepted this view as normative, though several have issued a
condemnation.

## Example argument from Scripture

The sayings in Matthew 24 concerning the "Great Tribulation" are
seen in preterism as being fulfilled in the destruction of
Jerusalem cuminating in AD 70. Support for this claim is drawn from
Jesus' saying that "this generation will not pass away until all
these things have taken place," which has the appearance of
limiting the events described to an event that was going to take
place in the first century.

Potential difficulties arise when critics of preterism point out
that Matthew 24 also refers to the coming of the Son of man in the
clouds of heaven. The claim is then made that since this refers to
the return of Jesus in the air, and this never happened in the
first century, the preterist approach must be mistaken. The
preterist reply has been to point out that there is no reason to
assume that this "coming" is the second coming of Christ hoped for
in the New Testament. In the Old Testament God speaks of coming to
His people in judgement. In Isaiah 19, as a striking example, the
prophet refers to the impending judgement on Egypt, and we are told
"See, the LORD rides on a swift cloud, and is coming to Egypt." The
language of God coming to us, and even the language of riding the
clouds, does not necessarily refer to the second coming of Christ
that Christianity generally affirms.

## Objections to Preterism

Although Preterists are at general agreement among themselves
regarding key eschatological issues, weighty objections have been
brought against Preterism by advocates of
Futurism.[Dispensationalists](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism")
argue that the Preterist view of Christ's
[Second Coming](Second_Coming "Second Coming") is flawed, as it
ignores the fact that God's covenant with [Israel](Israel "Israel")
was "everlasting," and therefore cannot have ended in A.D. 70. It
is also asserted that Preterists confuse verses which speak of a
"scattering" with those that predict a "restoration" of the
covenant nation. (Deuteronomy 30: 1-10). Most Dispensationalists
teach that Israel was dispersed in A.D. 70. However, textual
support is brought in to show that a future regathering and
national restoration of Israel is in order. Futurists have
sometimes claimed that Preterism logically leads to Anti-Semitism
and [replacement theology](Supersessionism "Supersessionism").
