**Prevenient grace** refers to the grace of God in a person's life
that *precedes* [conversion](Conversion "Conversion") (or
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation")). The word "prevenient,"
considered an archaic term today, was common in the King James
english and simply means to "go before" or "precede." Likewise, it
is sometimes called "preventing" grace (from *prevenient*) with the
same meaning.

-   In [Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") Theology, it is the
    particular grace which precedes human decision -- a salvific grace
    *prior to*, and without reference to, anything we have done. See
    [Irresistible grace](Irresistible_grace "Irresistible grace"),
    sometimes called efficacious grace or the effectual call.

-   In [Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism") and Wesleyanism, it
    is a grace that offsets the
    [noetic effects](Noetic_effects_of_sin "Noetic effects of sin") of
    [the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall"), restores man's
    [free will](Free_will "Free will"), and thus enables every person
    to choose to come to Christ or not. There are two forms of this
    view:
    -   [Universal prevenient grace](Resistible_prevenient_grace#Universal_prevenient_grace "Resistible prevenient grace")
        — This grace is extended to every person.
    -   [Individualistic prevenient grace](Resistible_prevenient_grace#Individualistic_prevenient_grace "Resistible prevenient grace")
        — This grace is only extended to those who come under the
        intelligent hearing of the gospel, and not to every person.


-   In Romanism (i.e.,
    [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic")), it is an
    assisting grace which aids people who choose to co-operate in
    justifying themselves. See Council of Trent (Sess. VI, cap. v).
