**Pride** can be broken down into two categories: righteous pride,
and sinful pride. For example,

-   Righteous: "I am proud of my son for doing so well on his
    test."
-   Sinful: "I did better on the test than my classmates because I
    am smarter."
-   Righteous: "I am glad my spouse chose to marry me."
-   Sinful: "I am glad my spouse chose me for my good looks and
    charming personality."

## Righteous pride

Righteous pride may be defined as taking joy in something without
conceit; that is, without believing that one is better than another
for any reason. Christians are called to "never boast except in the
cross" ([Galatians](Galatians "Galatians") 6:14), looking with
[joy](Joy "Joy") to the [salvation](Salvation "Salvation") provided
by [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"), obtained by no
personal merit.

## Sinful pride

Sinful pride is anything which, either directly or indirectly,
attempts to place oneself above [God](God "God"). It is
[idolatry](Idolatry "Idolatry") of the self, affecting many aspects
of the life. [Deuteronomy](Deuteronomy "Deuteronomy") 8:17-18 says
this: "You may say to yourself, 'My power and the strength of my
hands have produced this wealth for me.' But remember the LORD your
God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and
so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your forefathers, as it
is today."
