"The **priesthood of all believers**... means that in the community
of saints, [God](God "God") has constructed his body such that we
are all priests to one another. Priesthood of all believers has
more to do with the believer's service than with an individual's
position or status. We are all believer-priests. We all stand
equally before God. Such standing does not negate specific
giftedness or calling. It rather enchances our giftedness as each
one of us individually and collectively does his part to build the
body (Eph. 4:11-16). We are all priests. We are all responsible."
(Daniel Akin in *Perspectives on Church Government*, p. 37)

## Biblical support

-   "you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a
    spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual
    sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ... But you are a
    chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his
    own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who
    called you out of darkness into his marvelous light." (1 Pe. 2:5 &
    9, NIV)

Some theologians contend the tearing of the temple curtain at the
time of [Christ's](Jesus "Jesus") death symbolized the invalidation
of a disctinct priestly caste. The temple curtain (along with
doors, 2 Chr. 4:22) seperated the
[Holy of Holies](index.php?title=Holy_of_Holies&action=edit&redlink=1 "Holy of Holies (page does not exist)")
from the rest of the [temple](Temple "Temple").(Ex. 26:33)
According to
[Mosaic Law](index.php?title=Mosaic_Law&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mosaic Law (page does not exist)")
only priests could pass beyond the curtain. "(50) And when Jesus
had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. (51) At
that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to
bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split." (Mat. 27:50-51, NIV)
