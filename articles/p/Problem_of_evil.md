The **problem of evil**, sometimes described with the term
**theodicy**, is an aspect of theology concerned with how to
reconcile the existence of a good [God](God "God") with the
existence of evil in the world. In general, theodicy addresses the
"problem of evil" and an attempted theory of reconciliation is
sometimes called theodicy. Several such theories include the
*unknown purpose defense*, which suggests that suffering exists for
a reason that is beyond our comprehension; the *free will defense*,
which suggests that God allows evil to preserve human free will;
and the *soul-making theodicy*, which suggests that God uses evil
to build character.

## Origin of the term

The term *theodicy* comes from the Greek (*theós*, "god") and
(*díkē*, "justice"), and has to do with justifying the goodness of
God and understanding his sovereignty with the existence of evil in
the world. The term was coined in 1710 by the German philosopher
Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) in a work entitled
*Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man, and the Origin of Evil.*
The purpose of the essays was to show that the evil in the world
does not conflict with the goodness of God, and that,
notwithstanding its many evils, this world is the best of all
possible worlds.

## Sovereignty and goodness

The issue for many is expressed by the question, "How can God be
truly good, sovereignly in control of all that happens, and yet
allow the evil so evident in the world?" Often, the answer is
forced by an either-or approach as seen by Harold Kushner in his
book, *When Bad Things Happen to Good People* (1983,
[ISBN 0380603926](http://www.theopedia.com/Special:BookSources/0380603926)).
In the presence of the evil we see around us, Kushner contends that
*either* God is sovereign and therefore not truly good, *or* he is
truly good and not sovereign with regard to mankind and its
circumstances. His conclusion (as might be expected) is that God is
indeed good, and therefore cannot really be in control of this
world or what happens in people's lives.

## Suggested solutions

### Charles Hodge

According to [Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge"), the best
method of dealing with this question is:

"to rest satisfied with the simple statements of the Bible. The
Scriptures teach, (1) That the glory of God is the end to which the
promotion of holiness, and the production of happiness, and all
other ends are subordinate. (2) That, therefore, the
self-manifestation of God, the revelation of his infinite
perfection, being the highest conceivable, or possible good, is the
ultimate end of all his works in creation, providence, and
redemption. (3) As sentient creatures are necessary for the
manifestation of God's benevolence, so there could be no
manifestation of his mercy without misery, or of his grace and
justice, if there were no sin.

"As the heavens declare the glory of God, so He has devised the
plan of redemption, " To the intent that now unto the
principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the
Church the manifold wisdom of God," (Eph. 3:10). The knowledge of
God is eternal life. It is for creatures the highest good. And the
promotion of that knowledge, the manifestation of the manifold
perfections of the infinite God, is the highest end of all his
works. This is declared by the Apostle to be the end contemplated,
both in the punishment of sinners and in the salvation of
believers. It is an end to which, he says, no man can rationally
object.

"What if God, willing to shew his wrath (or justice), and to make
his power known, endured with much long suffering the vessels of
wrath fitted to destruction: and that He might make known the
riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore
prepared unto glory," (Rom. 9:22, 23). Sin, therefore, according
the Scriptures, is permitted, that the justice of God may be known
in its punishment, and his grace in its forgiveness. And the
universe, without the knowledge of these attributes, would be like
the earth without the light of the sun."

### Augustine

At one point Augustine "believed that evil [was] a kind of material
substance" (*Confessions*, 5:10); however, he came to believe that
evil was not real: "[it] has no existence except as a privation of
good" (ibid, 3:7). Furthermore, "whatever things exist are good,
and the evil into whose origins I was inquiring is not a substance,
for if it were a substance, it would be good... evil does not exist
at all" (ibid., 7:7-8). As a "privation" of good, evil is that
which is the absence of good.

Augustine consequently attributed the problem of evil in the world
to [the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall") of humanity after the
disobedience in the
[Garden of Eden](Garden_of_Eden "Garden of Eden") and thus the
[depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity") of man. Accordingly,
this not only absolves God of creating evil but also allows Him to
show the world His love by bringing Christ into the world. (Cf.
*Confessions*, 4:24, 5:20, 7:4)

### Gordon Clark

In his *God and Evil: The Problem Solved* (see below),
[Gordon Clark](Gordon_Clark "Gordon Clark") shows us that standing
on the rock foundation of the Word of God (Matthew 7:24,25), we
have an answer to the theodicy issue. It is all a matter of one’s
epistemic base. With the Bible as the axiomatic starting point, the
existence of evil is really not the problem it is made out to be.
God, who is altogether holy and who can do no wrong, sovereignly
decrees evil things to occur for his own good purposes (Isaiah
45:7). And just because he decreed it, it is right. See excerpts
[Here](http://www.monergism.com/evilproblem.html).

### The Atheistic conclusion

British philosopher and atheist Bertrand Russell once commented,
"No one can believe in a good God if they've sat at the bedside of
a dying
child".[[2]](http://www.str.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=5093)
Hence, in this view, evil is evidence that there is no God, unless
one would postulate a God that is not good.

The unfortunate reality is that the atheist can take no comfort in
such a heart-wrenching situation, for in a godless existence
suffering is ultimately meaningless. In Russell's own words, "Brief
and powerless is Man's life; on him and all his race the slow, sure
dooms falls pitiless and dark" (Philosophical Essays, 1910).
