**Process Theology** departs from traditional Christian beliefs
mainly because of its view of the [nature](Nature "Nature") of
[God](God "God") and His relationship to the universe. Many critics
relate this deviance to the low view of Scripture held by Process
Theologians who by and large deny the
[divine inspiration](Inspiration "Inspiration") of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"). Others critique Process Theology as
[panentheism](Panentheism "Panentheism") which says that God is to
the world as a soul is to a body. It is believed that God is *not*
the universe as in [pantheism](Pantheism "Pantheism"), but that God
is apart from the universe, yet also *in* it. As the world is in
the process of changing, so is God, and he is in the *process* of
becoming all that he can be.


## Process theology and God

In Process theology, God has two poles:

1.  A **primordial** pole - this pole is eternal, unchanging, and
    not of this world.
2.  And a **consequent** pole - this pole is temporal, changing,
    and of this world.

The primordial pole is what God *could* be, or what his potential
is. Thus, the consequent pole is what God *is* at this very moment.
This means that God is not perfect, and in order for him to become
perfect he needs our help. Because God is limited within his
consequent pole, he is not
[omnipotent](Omniscience_of_God "Omniscience of God") (he does not
know everything). Thus he cannot control evil and cannot guarantee
that it will ever be conquered. Once again, this leaves God relying
on humans to help him with his creation.
