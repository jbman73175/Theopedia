The **procession of the Holy Spirit** is "the relation which the
third person sustains to the first and second, wherein by an
eternal and necessary, i.e., not voluntary, act of the Father and
the Son, their whole identical divine essence, without alienation,
division, or change, is communicated to the Holy Ghost"
-[A. A. Hodge](A._A._Hodge "A. A. Hodge"), *Outlines in Theology*,
p. 189

"There is, in fact, only one verse in Scripture which is commonly
put forward to prove this doctrine, and it is found in John 15:26:
'But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the
Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father,
he shall bear witness of me.' "
