**Progressive Dispensationalism** is a recent refinement of the
older Traditional (or Classic)
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") that
arose in the 1980's and 90's. Though often misrepresented,
Progressive Dispensationalism owns the following hallmarks, many of
which are shared by Traditional Dispensationalists.

Dispensationalism itself is a hermeneutical framework used to guide
biblical interpretation. Although often presented as a series of
administrations enumerating God's major dealings with mankind, the
interpretive center of Dispensationalism is actually a distinction
between [Israel](Israel "Israel"), the [Church](Church "Church"),
and the
[Millennial Kingdom](Millennial_Kingdom "Millennial Kingdom"). The
opposing viewpoint found in
[Reformed theology](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology") is
[Covenant theology](Covenant_theology "Covenant theology"),
sometimes referred to as Replacement Theology^[[1]](#note-0)^ in
which interpreters view the church as the fulfillment of OT Israel.
In this view, true Israel (the believing remnant) becomes the NT
church and is expanded to include Gentiles. The OT promises made to
Israel are fulfilled in the church. Progressive Dispensationalism
somewhat combines the two viewpoints, but in a limited way.

Dispensationalists (whether Traditional or Progressive) all hold to
the following: Jesus Christ will return to establish an earthly
thousand year Kingdom on the earth in which the genetic nation of
Israel and the Jewish people are specially exalted (not merely
included).

## Tenents of Progressive Dispensationalism

1.  Is *not* Replacement Theology; Progressive Dispensationalists
    assert that God will keep His promises made to “Israel according to
    the flesh,” the genetic descendents of Jacob.
2.  Acknowledges a future 7-year
    [Tribulation](Tribulation "Tribulation") followed by a 1,000
    Millennium with Christ personally present and reigning from
    Jerusalem.
3.  Affirms that the nation of Israel (in the Millennium) will be
    exalted as a nation with a rebuilt Temple and sacrificial offerings
    (that the Messianic Age is compatible with Temple worship is
    demonstrated in Acts 21:17-26).
4.  Is similar to (the
    [Messianic Jewish](index.php?title=Messianic_Jewish&action=edit&redlink=1 "Messianic Jewish (page does not exist)")
    scholar) David Stern’s “Olive Branch Theology” espoused in
    *Restoring the Jewishness of the Gospel*.
5.  Does see the church fulfilling many Old Testament prophecies
    (and thus differs from Traditional Dispensationalism on this
    point), but in a less literal sense or incomplete sense;
    Progressives break rank with Traditionals by concluding that the
    church was anticipated in the Old Testament (but not clearly). The
    term "mystery," when used in reference to the church, is not
    defined as "something previously unrevealed," (as in Traditional
    Dispensationalism) but "previously revealed unclearly."
6.  Views the church as being blessed through Israel; Progressives
    avow that God has never stopped working with Israel (some Jews now
    believe, and He is provoking others to jealousy); the Jews will
    rebuild the Tribulation Temple largely in unbelief; although the
    144,000 will be saved during the earlier part of the Tribulation,
    most Jews will not believe until the Battle of Armageddon, as
    interpreted from Zechariah 12.
7.  Essentially recognizes the more literal fulfillment of prophecy
    (which is Traditional Dispensationalism’s strong suit) but accepts
    how the New Testament authors quote and apply the Old Testament to
    the church (Traditional Dispensationalism’s most vulnerable point).
8.  Is a "now, but not yet" viewpoint (as argued by C. Marvin Pate
    in *The End of the Age Has Come*); the Kingdom Age is breaking
    forth now, but will have a complete fulfillment during the
    Millennium.

## Variations on Progressive Dispensationalism

Some Progressives depart further away from Traditional
Dispensationalism than others, though none advocate
[Covenant Theology](Covenant_Theology "Covenant Theology"). Robert
Saucy (*The Case for Progressive Dispensationalism*) presents a
detailed work most closely resembling Traditional
Dispensationalism, making a clear cut distinction between the
Church and Israel, whereas others claim that Old Testament
believers in heaven were joined to New Testament believers (melded
into the universal church) on the Day of Pentecost (as, for
example,
[Tim Warner](http://www.geocities.com/lasttrumpet_2000/pd/twpd101.html)).
Some Progressives believe Christ is reigning on David's throne
during the church age; many (perhaps most) reject such an
assertion.

Progressive Dispensationalism is based the idea of Prophetic Double
Fulfillment. Progressives argue that many prophecies have two
fulfillments, a near (in time) less literal fulfillment and a
distant (in time) more literal fulfillment.

As a result of the strong connection between Progressive
Dispensationalism and Double Fulfillment, some PDs would interpret
Revelation in a dual manner: a near (in time) less literal
fulfillment to the early church and a more literal fulfillment
pertaining to the end times.

Some advocates of Traditional Dispensationalism have misrepresented
the true nature of Progressive Dispensationalism. Additionally,
some Replacement Theologians have likewise attacked
Dispensationalism (of all kinds) by characterizing the entire
movement by its fringe elements.


## Noted

1.  [↑](#ref-0) Replacement theology is usually a pejorative term
    used by dispensationalists to refer to Covenant Theology's view
    that the church is "the Israel of God" (Gal. 6:16). See a
    dispensational definition at
    [Gotquestions.org](http://www.gotquestions.org/replacement-theology.html)
