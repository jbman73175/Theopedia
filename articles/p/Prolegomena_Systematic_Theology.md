**Prolegomena** simply means *prefatory remarks*. The
**Prolegomena** of a Systematic Theology refers to the
methodological questions generally found in the opening sections,
dealing with the nature and task of theology and perhaps with the
nature and focal point of revelation.^[[1]](#note-0)^

Systematic theology is a structured full encompassing synthesis of
historical, philosophical, apologetical, and exegetical out
workings from man of the Bible with all other documents pertaining
to the God of the Bible, and all His works in a scientifically
organized manner to create a harmonization of truthful concise
thought.

The method of theology is crucial to the desired outcome, but
before that can be formulated, a proper motivation must be at the
core of any theological endeavor. The outcome of the systematic
theology process must be out from the believer’s faith to discover
the truth of God. Only through faith in the truth which he seeks
will God bestow the desired knowledge and wisdom on to him. In 1
Kings 3:9-12, Solomon, through faith desires to know the ways of
God, “So give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your
people to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge
this great people of Yours”. God Responds because of Solomon’s
faith and grants him the wisdom he desired, “behold, I have done
according to your words. Behold, I have given you a wise and
discerning heart”. With the blessing of Whom the believer wishes to
inquire about, a practical method can be established.

Theology must begin with a central idea from which a thesis is
derived that shall be the focus of all research and create a theme
in the resources chosen in relation to it. All the information
gathered then is examined and sorted into importance of aiding in
development of the thesis, and must be set alongside Scripture and
compared for any discrepancies. Any sources that do not mesh with
biblical teaching are to be excluded, but all main supportive
sources along with verses of Scripture can be collected and
compiled. For a thorough use of Scripture, cultural and historical
background resources should be used to gain a greater understanding
of context. By weighing the positive and negative arguments in
comparison to Scripture the developed thesis can be found to be
true or false, and concluded on in accordance to the test of
application.

Theology is important to every human on earth. Through the good
practice of theology, many aspects of a person are affected such as
a mindset and correct way of thinking toward God which will lead to
proper actions, and ultimately reform their lifestyle into one
lived for the glory of God.
