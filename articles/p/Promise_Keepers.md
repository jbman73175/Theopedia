**Promise Keepers** is a Christian mens movement founded in 1990 by
Bill McCartney. The main thrust of the group is to introduce men to
Jesus Christ and help them grow in Him. The focus is on
responsibility, leadership in the family, and the Seven Promises.
Their main avenue of teaching is through conferences.
