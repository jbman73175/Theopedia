**Proof texting** is the method by which a person appeals to a
[biblical text](Bible "Bible") to prove or justify a theological
position without regard for the context of the passage they are
citing. At its worst, for example, "theologian A claims to have a
more 'biblical' theology than theologian B, based upon counting up
verse in parentheses (on a random page from each work) and claiming
to have three times as many." ^[[1]](#note-0)^ The result can be
that certain portions of Scripture are more heavily treated than
others (e.g. Pauline texts). Yet, while the method of proof texting
can be problematic, nevertheless theology must still maintain a
thoroughly biblical character. The
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") authors support this
idea in their own citations of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") text.
^[[2]](#note-1)^ Thus, the main criticism of proof texting falls on
its method rather than its desire and motivation to base theology
on the [canonical](Canon "Canon") text. But in one's interpretation
of a text, the genre and context should never be ignored. As the
saying goes, "a text without a context is a pretext for a proof
text."
