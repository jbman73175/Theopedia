"The word **propitiation** carries the basic idea of appeasement,
or satisfaction, specifically towards [God](God "God").
Propitiation is a two-part act that involves appeasing the wrath of
an offended person and being reconciled to them."^[[1]](#note-0)^
Propitiation is that "by which it becomes consistent with his
character and government to pardon and bless the sinner. The
propitiation does not procure his love or make him loving; it only
renders it consistent for him to exercise his love towards
sinners."^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Background

Luke 18:13. In the parable of the "Pharisee and the Tax Collector",
we also have an extraordinary use of the same word group. Note the
Tax Collector cries out, "God, be merciful to me a sinner".
Although our English translations do not bear it out in obvious
fashion, this is a cognate verb, "be merciful" (hilaskomai). Note
Colin Browns discussion: Vol. 3, 160

In Rom. 3:25 and Heb. 9:5 the [Greek](Greek "Greek") word
*hilasterion* ([KJV](KJV "KJV"), "mercy-seat") is used. It is the
word employed by the [Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint") (LXX).
translators in Ex. 25:17 and elsewhere as the equivalent for the
[Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew") *kapporeth*, which means "covering," and
is used of the lid of the ark of the covenant (Ex. 25:21; 30:6).
*Hilasterion* came to denote not only the mercy-seat or lid of the
ark, but also propitiation or reconciliation by blood. On the great
day of atonement the high priest carried the blood of the sacrifice
he offered for all the people within the veil and sprinkled with it
the "mercy-seat," and so made propitiation.^[[3]](#note-2)^

  
In 1 John 2:2; 4:10, Christ is called the "propitiation for our
sins." Here a different Greek word is used, *hilasmos*. Christ is
"the propitiation," because by his becoming our substitute and
assuming our obligations he [expiated](Expiation "Expiation") our
guilt, covering it by the vicarious punishment which he endured.
(Compare Heb. 2:17, where the expression "make reconciliation" of
the KJV is more correctly in the [ASV](ASV "ASV") "make
propitiation").^[[4]](#note-3)^

## Propitiation versus Expiation

Propitiation literally means *to make favorable* and specifically
includes the idea of dealing with God’s wrath against sinners.
Expiation literally means *to make pious* and implies either the
removal or cleansing of sin.

The idea of propitiation *includes* that of expiation as its means;
but the word "expiation" has no reference to quenching God’s
righteous anger. The difference is that the object of expiation is
sin, not God. One propitiates a person, and one expiates a problem.
Christ's death was therefore both an expiation and a propitiation.
By expiating (removing the problem of) sin God was made propitious
(favorable) to us.

The case for translating the Greek word *hilasterion* as
"expiation" was put forward by C. H. Dodd in 1935 and gained wide
support.^[[5]](#note-4)^ As a result *hilasterion* has been
translated as ‘expiation’ in the RSV and some other modern
versions. But a generation of debate has shown, especially in the
work of [Leon Morris](Leon_Morris "Leon Morris"), that the
linguistic evidence appears to favor “propitiation” as the more
appropriate rendering.^[[6]](#note-5)^
