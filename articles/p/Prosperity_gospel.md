**Prosperity gospel** supporters "believe that
[faith](Faith "Faith") works as a mighty power or force. That it is
through their faith that they can obtain anything they want such as
health, wealth, or any form of personal success. However, this
force is only released through their faith."^[[1]](#note-0)^
Adherents of the Prosperity Gospel, almost always also part of the
[word of faith movement](Word_of_faith_movement "Word of faith movement"),
usually hold to the tenet that God never grants
[suffering](Suffering "Suffering") or poverty, and that both always
should be attributed to sin and Satan in every way, and in no way
attributed to God. For example, Kenneth Copeland writes,

"Tradition has taught that God uses sicknesses, trials, and
tribulation to teach us. This idea, however, is not based on the
Bible. God has never used sickness to discipline His children and
keep them in line. Sickness is of Satan, and God doesn't need Satan
to straight us out! "Kenneth, I see Christians that are sick all
the time. Why does God allow it?" God allows it because we do. Why?
Because He's given us the right to make our own choices, along with
authority over the kingdom of darkness. According to Deuteronomy
30:19, He has put life and death before us. Then He instructed us
to choose life. It's up to us to make that decision. You have the
power to live after God's ways and resist sickness, or not to. You
have the choice to let Satan run over you, or use the authority you
have been given. Good gifts come from God. No matter what tradition
has taught, sickness and disease simply don't fall into the
category of good gifts---ever."^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Criticism

### God himself is the chief blessing

While it is true that God often shows his goodness by granting
health and wealth, we must see these as secondary blessings. The
primary blessing is knowing God himself (Psalm 27:4; John 17:3),
and all secondary blessing is meant to point to him. We will enjoy
health and material blessing to a degree unfathomable at the
resurrection, but while on this fallen earth, preparing in a
spiritual battle for either heaven or hell, we must remember the
words of Proverbs:

"Two things I ask of you; deny them not to me before I die: Remove
far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor
riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me, lest I be
full and deny you and say, 'Who is the Lord?' or lest I be poor and
steal and profane the name of my God." (Proverbs 30:7-9)
### Jesus warned of the danger of wealth

Jesus frequently warned against the allure of wealth. In Matthew
19, after Jesus told the rich young man, "If you would be perfect,
go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven; and come, follow me" (v. 21), he said:

"Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter
the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter
the kingdom of God." (Matthew 19:23-24)
And in Matthew 6:

"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and
rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for
yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust
destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where
your treasure is, there your heart will be also." (Matthew 6:19-21)
And in Luke 6:

"But woe to you that are rich, for you have received your
consolation. Woe to you that are full now, for you shall hunger.
Woe to you that laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep." (Luke
6:24-25)
### Suffering is a blessed means of producing endurance and testing genuineness

When we define (either implicitly or explicitly) blessedness
chiefly as having material things and good health, and obligate God
to bless us with these things, we ignore scripture which speaks of
the sufferings of the followers of Christ as a badge of honor, and
a means of producing endurance and testing genuineness. Paul
wrote,

"For it has been *granted* to you that for the sake of Christ you
should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake"
(Philippians 1:29, emphasis added).
"More than that, we *rejoice* in our sufferings, knowing that
suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and
character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because
God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit
who has been given to us." (Romans 5:3-5, emphasis added)
Peter wrote,

"In this you *rejoice*, though now for a little while, if
necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the
tested genuineness of your faith more precious than gold that
perishes though it is tested by fire may be found to result in
praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ." (1
Peter 1:6-7, emphasis added)
And we have David saying,

"It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your
statutes." (Psalm 119:71)
And lastly, James writes a sober warning to those who have "lived
on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence":

"Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming
upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten.
Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be
evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have
laid up treasure in the last days. Behold, the wages of the
laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, are
crying out against you, and the cries of the harvesters have
reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth
in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in
a day of slaughter." (James 5:1-5)
### God's goodness is not bound by our exacting demands

The theology of the Prosperity Gospel also distrusts God's higher
prerogative and wisdom and sovereignty--God has the final, supreme
right to answer our prayers how and when he pleases. His wise
goodness is not bound by our exacting demands.

-   "My God is a God who wants me to have things. He wants me to
    bling. He wants me to be the hottest thing on the block. I don t
    know what kind of God the rest of y all are serving, but the God I
    serve says, 'Mary, you need to be the hottest thing this year, and
    I m gonna make sure you re doing that'." -

-   "He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he
    who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity. When goods
    increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their
    owner but to see them with his eyes? Sweet is the sleep of a
    laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of
    the rich will not let him sleep. There is a grievous evil that I
    have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his
    hurt, and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father
    of a son, but he has nothing in his hand. As he came from his
    mother's womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take
    nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand. This also
    is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what gain
    is there to him who toils for the wind? Moreover, all his days he
    eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger. Behold,
    what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and
    find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun
    the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his
    lot. Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and
    power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil
    this is the gift of God. For he will not much remember the days of
    his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart."
    (Ecclesiastes 5:10-20)
