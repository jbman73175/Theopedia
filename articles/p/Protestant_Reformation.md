"The **Protestant Reformation** was a major 16th century European
movement aimed initially at reforming the beliefs and practices of
the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church").
Its religious aspects were supplemented by ambitious political
rulers who wanted to extend their power and control at the expense
of the Church. The Reformation ended the unity imposed by medieval
Christianity and, in the eyes of many historians, signaled the
beginning of the modern era. A weakening of the old order was
already under way in Northern Europe, as evidenced by the emergence
of thriving new cities and a determined middle class.

"In 1517, in one of the signal events of western history,
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"), a German
Augustinian monk, posted [95 theses](95_Theses "95 Theses") on a
church door in the university town of Wittenberg. That act was
common academic practice of the day and served as an invitation to
debate. Luther's propositions challenged some portions of Roman
Catholic doctrine and a number of specific practices.

"The movement quickly gained adherents in the German states, the
Netherlands, Scandinavia, Scotland and portions of France. Support
came from sincere religious reformers, while others manipulated the
movement to gain control of valuable church property.

"The term Protestant was not initially applied to the reformers,
but later was used to describe all groups protesting Roman Catholic
orthodoxy." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

As the hope of reforming the Roman church faded, the "protestants"
were forced to separate from Roman Catholicism resulting in
[Lutheran churches](Lutheran "Lutheran") in Germany, Scandinavia
and some eastern European countries, the
[Reformed churches](Reformed_churches "Reformed churches") in
Switzerland and the Netherlands,
[Presbyterian churches](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") in Scotland,
and the [Anglican church](Anglicanism "Anglicanism") in England,
and other diverse elements all of which have evolved into the
Protestant denominations of today.

## Precursors to the Reformation

### John Wycliffe

[John Wycliffe](John_Wycliffe "John Wycliffe") (1330–84) attacked
what he saw as corruptions within the church, including the sale of
indulgences, pilgrimages, the excessive veneration of saints, and
the low moral and intellectual standards of ordained priests.

Wycliffe also repudiated the doctrine of
[transubstantiation](Transubstantiation "Transubstantiation"), held
that the Bible was the sole standard of Christian doctrine, and
argued that the authority of the Pope was not grounded in
Scripture. Some of Wycliffe's early followers translated the Bible
into English, while later followers, known as Lollards, held that
the Bible was the sole authority and that Christians were called
upon to interpret the Bible for themselves. The Lollards also
argued against clerical celibacy, transubstantiation, mandatory
oral confession, pilgrimages, and indulgences.

### John Huss

[John Huss](John_Huss "John Huss") (1369–1415) — A Bohemian priest,
excommunicated in 1410, and burned at the stake for heresy in 1415.
His death lead to the Hussite Wars in Bohemia. Huss followed
Wycliffe's teachings closely, translating Wycliffe's *Trialogus*
into Czechoslovakian, and modeling the first ten chapters of his
own *De Ecclesia* after Wycliffe's writings. He believed in
predestination, regarded the Bible as the ultimate religious
authority, and argued that Christ, rather than any ecclesiastical
official, is the true head of the church.

## Prominent figures in the Reformation

### Martin Luther

[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") (1483–1546) — In
1517, nails his [95 Theses](95_Theses "95 Theses") onto a
Wittenberg Church door. These theses were Latin propositions
opposing the manner in which indulgences (release from the temporal
penalties for sin through the payment of money) were being sold in
order to raise money for the building of Saint Peter's in Rome.

### Huldreich Zwingli

[Huldreich Zwingli](Huldreich_Zwingli "Huldreich Zwingli")
(1484–1531) — Swiss theologian and leader of early Reformation
movements in Switzerland. Vigorously denounces the sale of
indulgences in 1518.

### John Calvin

[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") (1509–64) — Calvin was a
French theologian and reformer who fled religious persecution in
France and settled in Geneva in 1536. He instituted a form of
Church government in Geneva which has become known as the
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") church. He insisted on
reforms including: the congregational singing of the Psalms as part
of church worship, the teaching of a catechism and confession of
faith to children, and the enforcement of a strict moral discipline
in the community by the pastors and members of the church. Geneva
was, under Calvin, essentially a theocracy.

### John Knox

[John Knox](John_Knox "John Knox") (1513–1572) — An ardent disciple
of Calvin, Knox established Calvinistic Protestantism as the
national religion of Scotland. He left a powerful political legacy
within the Calvinist or Reformed branch of Protestantism, a
political legacy known as
[Presbyterianism](Presbyterian "Presbyterian").

### Henry VIII

[Henry VIII](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII "wikipedia:Henry VIII")
(1491–1547) — In 1533, Henry was excommunicated by the pope for
marrying Anne Boleyn and having the archbishop of Canterbury
sanction the divorce from his first wife, Catherine. In 1534, Henry
had Parliament pass an act appointing the king and his successors
supreme head of the Church of England, thus establishing an
independent national Anglican church.

## Theological Issues of the Reformation

The theology of the Reformers departed from the Roman Catholic
Church primarily on the basis of three great
principles:^[[2]](#note-Doyler364f)^

-   Sole authority of Scripture,
-   Justification by faith alone, and
-   Priesthood of the believer.

### Sola Scriptura

**Sola Scriptura** (*by Scripture alone*) was one of the watchwords
of the Reformation. This doctrine maintains that Scripture, as
contained in the [Bible](Bible "Bible"), is the only authority for
the Christian in matters of faith, life and conduct. The teachings
and traditions of the church are to be completely subordinate to
the Scriptures. Roman Catholicism, on the other hand, holds
Scripture and Tradition to be of the same inspired
*Deposit of Faith*.

### Sola Fide

**Sola Fide** (*by faith alone*) was the other watchword of the
Reformation. This doctrine maintains that we are justified before
God (and thus saved) by faith alone, not by anything we do, not by
anything the church does for us, and not by faith plus anything
else. It was also recognized by the early Reformers that Sola Fide
is not rightly understood until it is seen as anchored in the
broader principle of **Sola Gratia**, by grace alone. Hence the
Reformers were calling the church back to the basic teaching of
Scripture where the apostle Paul states that we are "saved by grace
through faith and that not of ourselves, it is the gift of God,"
Eph. 2:8.

### Priesthood of all believers

The third great principle of the Reformation was the
**priesthood of all believers**. The Scriptures teach that
believers are a "holy priesthood," 1 Pet. 2:5. All believers are
priests before God through our great high priest Jesus Christ.
"There is one God and one mediator between God and man, the man
Christ Jesus," 1 Tim. 2:5. As believers, we all have direct access
to God through Christ, there is no necessity for an earthly
mediator. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox concept of the
priesthood was seen as having no warrant in Scripture, viewed as a
perversion and mis-application of the Old Testament Aaronic or
Levitical priesthood which was clearly fulfilled in Christ and done
away with by the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament").

As a result of these principles, the Reformers rejected the
authority of the Pope, the merit of good works, indulgences, the
mediation of Mary and the Saints, all but the two
[sacraments](Sacraments "Sacraments") instituted by Christ
([Baptism](Baptism "Baptism") and the
[Lord's Supper](Lord's_Supper "Lord's Supper")), the doctrine of
[transubstantiation](Transubstantiation "Transubstantiation"), the
[mass](Mass "Mass") as a sacrifice,
[purgatory](Purgatory "Purgatory"), prayers for the dead,
confessions to a priest, the use of Latin in the services, and all
the paraphernalia that expressed these ideas.

Even though the [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic")
and [Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox")
churches fall within [Orthodoxy](Orthodox "Orthodox") as most would
define it, much of their teaching beyond the basic tenets is
regarded as erroneous by conservative Protestants. In fact, they
would say much of it is clearly to be regarded as false teaching
which has perverted the gospel of God's grace in Jesus Christ. In
general, [evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") Protestants
see the Reformation as simply a call back to biblical
Christianity.
