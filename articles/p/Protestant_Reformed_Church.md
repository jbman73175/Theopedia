The **Protestant Reformed Churches in America** (PRC) is a
denomination of approximately 28 churches and over 7,000 members.
They believe that the [Bible](Bible "Bible") is the inspired word
of God and use only the
[King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version") in
their churches. The PRC holds to the doctrine summarized in the
following Reformed confessions: the
[Heidelberg Catechism](Heidelberg_Catechism "Heidelberg Catechism"),
the [Belgic Confession](Belgic_Confession "Belgic Confession") and
the [Canons of Dort](Canons_of_Dort "Canons of Dort"). These creeds
are commonly referred to as the
[Three Forms of Unity](Three_Forms_of_Unity "Three Forms of Unity").

## History and Theology

The Protestant Reformed Churches in America was founded in 1924 as
a result of a controversy regarding
[common grace](Common_grace "Common grace") in the
[Christian Reformed Church](Christian_Reformed_Church "Christian Reformed Church").
Led by [Herman Hoeksema](Herman_Hoeksema "Herman Hoeksema"), a
group rejected the CRC teaching on common grace as a slippery-slope
to [Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"), if not an actual
variant of that theology. This group was deposed by the CRC and
thus formed the Protestant Reformed Churches in America. The PRC is
characterized by
[Supralapsarian](Supralapsarianism "Supralapsarianism")
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") and has been accused by its
critics of being
[Hyper-Calvinistic](Hyper-Calvinism "Hyper-Calvinism").
