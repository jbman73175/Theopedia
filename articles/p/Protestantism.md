**Protestantism** is the movement within Christianity, representing
a split from the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church"),
which occurred during the 16th century in Europe in what is called
the
[Protestant Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation").

Commonly considered one of the three major branches of Christianity
(along with
[Roman Catholicism](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
and [Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy")),
Protestantism represents a diverse range of theological and social
perspectives, denominations and related organizations.
