Genesis 3:15 is sometimes called the **protoevangelium.** It is the
first reference in Scripture to the idea of a Messiah and is seen
as the first presentation of the gospel. The word is derived from
the Greek prefix *proto* meaning "first" and *euangelion* meaning
"gospel" or "good news.".

"And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your
seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, and you shall
bruise him on the heel," (Gen. 3:15 [NASB](NASB "NASB")).
