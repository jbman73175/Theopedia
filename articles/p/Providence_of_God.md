The **providence of God** may be defined as His guardianship and
care for His creatures and creation. Also, any manifestation of
such care may be described as providence.

"There is probably no point at which the Christian doctrine of God
comes more into conflict with contemporary worldviews than in the
matter of God’s providence. Providence means that God has not
abandoned the world that he created, but rather works within that
creation to manage all things according to the “immutable counsel
of His own will” (Westminster Confession of Faith, V, i). By
contrast, the world at large, even if it will on occasion
acknowledge God to have been the world’s Creator, is at least
certain that he does not now intervene in human affairs. Many think
that miracles do not happen, that prayer isn’t answered and that
most things “fall out” according to the functioning of impersonal
and unchangeable laws."^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Concurrence

Concurrence is "[a]n aspect of God's providence whereby he
cooperates with created things in every action, directing their
distinctive properties to cause them to act as they do"
([Wayne Grudem](Wayne_Grudem "Wayne Grudem")'s Systematic
Theology).
