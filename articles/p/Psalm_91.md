Psalm 91 is a widely quoted psalm. It follows Psalm 90 which is
distinctly attributed to Moses. Some attribute Psalm 91 as
belonging to Moses also. Moses asked to see the secretive glory of
God in Exodus 33:18 and Psalm 91 begins with a declaration
concerning the happy state of "he that dwelleth in the secret place
of the Most High. Similarly, Matthew 6:6 refers to God the Father
who "is in secret" and "seeth in secret".
