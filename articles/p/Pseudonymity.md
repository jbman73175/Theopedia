"**Pseudonymity** was a practice of those who did not have enough
authority themselves to create sacred texts and so borrowed the
name of an earlier illustrious or in this case notorious figure to
create the air of an authentic eyewitness document. It needs to be
said that this practice was very clearly denounced not only by
church fathers like [Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian") and
[Ireneaus](Ireneaus "Ireneaus") and
[Hippolytus](index.php?title=Hippolytus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hippolytus (page does not exist)")
who tell us about monks and priests being defrocked for dreaming up
such documents, but in the wider Greco-Roman world there were
plenty of persons who deplored this practice and saw it as a form
of deception and fraud. For example, Cicero and Quintilian both
complain about people creating documents in their name which they
had nothing to do with. There was indeed a moral issue with such
documents, then as now. It was not an 'acceptable literary practice
of that era' as some might lead [others] to believe."
