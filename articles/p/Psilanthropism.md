**Psilanthropism** denies the
[divinity of Christ](Deity_of_Jesus "Deity of Jesus"). The presumed
etymology of "psilanthropism" comes from the [Greek](Greek "Greek")
*psilo* (merely or only) and *anthropos* (man, human being) -- in
other words this view sees [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") as merely a man.

Psilanthropism was rejected *de facto* by the
[ecumenical councils](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils"),
especially in the
[First Council of Nicaea](First_Council_of_Nicaea "First Council of Nicaea"),
which was convened to deal directly with the denial of Jesus' deity
in [Arianism](Arianism "Arianism").
