In [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") theology,
**Purgatory** is a process of purification of the soul after death,
following the particular judgment and ordinarily a requirement
before entry into [heaven](Heaven "Heaven"). The word "purgatory"
was unknown before the 11th century: one of the first documents to
mention purgatorium by that name was a letter from the Benedictine
Nicholas of Saint Albans to the Cistercian Peter of Celle in 1176
(Haggh, 1997). Catholics would state that the concept dates from
much earlier, citing, among others,
[Gregory of Nyssa](Gregory_of_Nyssa "Gregory of Nyssa") (4th
century)

"When he has quitted his body and the difference between virtue and
vice is known he cannot approach God till the purging fire shall
have cleansed the stains with which his soul was infested. That
same fire in others will cancel the corruption of matter, and the
propensity to evil."
and [St. Augustine of Hippo](Augustine "Augustine"):

"Temporal punishments are suffered by some in this life only, by
some after death, by some both here and hereafter, but all of them
before that last and strictest judgment. But not all who suffer
temporal punishments after death will come to eternal punishments,
which are to follow after that judgment"
Purgatory was an essential element in the three-part world-scheme
expressed in Dante's *Divine Comedy*, written in the early 14th
century.
