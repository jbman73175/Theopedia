**Puritan**, or puritanism, refers to the movement of English
[Protestants](Protestantism "Protestantism") advocating further
reforms or even separation from the established
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England") which
arose on the heels of the
[Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation"),
especially seeking *purity* of [worship](Worship "Worship") and
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine").

## Terminology

The word *Puritan* is now applied unevenly to a number of
Protestant churches from the late 16th century to the early 18th
century. However, [Puritans](Puritans "Puritans") did not, by and
large, use the term for themselves. It was a term of abuse that
first surfaced in the 1560s. "Recusants", "Precisemen", and
"Precisions" were other early antagonistic terms for Puritans who
preferred to call themselves "the godly." The word "Puritan" was
thus always a descriptor of a *type* of religious belief, rather
than a particular form of church order.

That said, the single theological movement most consistently
self-described by the term "Puritan" was
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") or
[Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") and led to the establishment
of the Presbyterian Church. The term was used by the group itself
mainly in the sixteenth century, though it seems to have been used
often and in its earliest recorded instances as a term of abuse. By
the middle of the 17th century the group had become so divided that
"Puritan" was most often used by opponents and detractors of the
group, rather than by the practitioners themselves. The
[practitioners](Puritans "Puritans") knew themselves as members of
particular churches or movements, and not by the simple and
nebulous term "Puritan."

## History

## Beliefs

The central tenet of Puritanism was God's supreme authority over
human affairs, particularly in the church, and especially as
expressed in the Bible. This view led them to seek both individual
and corporate conformance to the teaching of the Bible, and it led
them to pursue both moral purity down to the smallest detail as
well as ecclesiastical purity to the highest level.

On the individual level, the Puritans emphasized that each person
should be continually reformed by the grace of God to fight against
indwelling [sin](Sin "Sin") and do what is right before God. Every
Christian, , a humble and obedient life would arise.

The Puritans tended to admire the early church fathers and quoted
them liberally in their works. In addition to arming the Puritans
to fight against later developments of the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") tradition, these
studies also led to the rediscovery of some ancient scruples.
[Chrysostom](index.php?title=Chrysostom&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chrysostom (page does not exist)"),
a favorite of the Puritans, spoke eloquently against drama and
other worldly endeavors, and the Puritans adopted his view when
decrying what they saw as the decadent culture of England, famous
at that time for its plays and bawdy London. The Pilgrims (the
separatist, congregationalist Puritans who went to America) are
likewise famous for banning from their New England colonies many
secular entertainments, such as games of chance, maypoles, and
drama, all of which were perceived as kinds of immorality.

At the level of the church body, the Puritans believed that the
worship of the church ought to be strictly regulated by what is
commanded in the Bible (known as the
[regulative principle](Regulative_principle "Regulative principle")).
The Puritans condemned as idolatry many worship practices
regardless of the practices' antiquity or widespread adoption among
Christians, which their opponents defended with tradition,. Like
some of Reformed churches on the European continent, Puritan
reforms were typified by a minimum of ritual and decoration and by
an unambiguous emphasis on preaching. Like the early church fathers
they eliminated the use of musical instruments in their worship
services, for various theological and practical
reasons.^[***[citations\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

Another important distinction was the Puritan approach to
church-state relations. They opposed the Anglican idea of the
supremacy of the monarch in the church (Erastianism), and following
[Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") they argued that the only head
of the Church in heaven or earth is Christ (not the Pope or
Archbishop of Canterbury). However, they believed that secular
governors are accountable to God (not through the church, but
alongside it) to protect and reward virtue, including "true
religion", and to punish wrongdoers — a policy that is best
described as non-interference rather than separation of church and
state. The separating Congregationalists, a segment of the Puritan
movement more radical than the Anglican Puritans, believed the
Divine Right of Kings was [heresy](Heresy "Heresy"), a belief that
became more pronounced during the reign of Charles I of
England.^[***[citations\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

Other notable beliefs included:

-   An emphasis on private study of the [Bible](Bible "Bible")
-   A desire to see education and enlightenment for the masses
    (especially so they could read the Bible for themselves)
-   The
    [priesthood of all believers](Priesthood_of_all_believers "Priesthood of all believers")
-   Simplicity in worship, the exclusion of vestments, images,
    candles, etc.
-   Some approved of the episcopalian church hierarchy, but others
    sought to reform the episcopal churches on the
    [presbyterian model](Presbyterian "Presbyterian"). Some separatist
    Puritans were presbyterian, but most were Congregationalists.

In addition to promoting lay education, it was important to the
Puritans to have knowledgeable, educated pastors, who could read
the Bible in its original Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic, as well as
ancient and modern church tradition and scholarly works, which were
most commonly written in Latin, and so most of their divines
undertook rigorous studies at the University of Oxford or the
University of Cambridge before seeking ordination. Diversions for
the educated included discussing the Bible and its practical
applications as well as reading the classics such as Cicero,
Virgil, and Ovid. They also encouraged the composition of poetry
that was religious nature, though they eschewed religious-erotic
poetry except for the
[Song of Solomon](Song_of_Solomon "Song of Solomon"), which they
considered magnificent poetry, without error, regulative for their
sexual pleasure, and, especially, as an
[allegory](index.php?title=Allegory&action=edit&redlink=1 "Allegory (page does not exist)")
of Christ and the Church.

In modern usage, the word *puritan* is often used as an informal
pejorative for someone who has strict views on sexual morality,
disapproves of recreation, and wishes to impose these beliefs on
others. None of these qualities were unique to Puritanism or
universally characteristic of the Puritans themselves, whose moral
views and
[ascetic](index.php?title=Asceticism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Asceticism (page does not exist)")
tendencies were no more extreme than many other Protestant
reformers of their time, and who were relatively tolerant of other
faiths — at least in England. The popular image is slightly more
accurate as a description of Puritans in colonial America, who were
among the most radical Puritans and whose social experiment took
the form of a Calvinist
[theocracy](index.php?title=Theocracy&action=edit&redlink=1 "Theocracy (page does not exist)").
