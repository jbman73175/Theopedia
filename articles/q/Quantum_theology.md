The term **Quantum Theology** most commonly refers to the
[New Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age "w:New Age")
worldview of Diarmuid O'Murchu, a
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism") priest. In
his book of the same name, O'Murchu overlays old familiar New Age
spirituality with a thin veneer of science jargon, and suggests
that science gives us no choice but to recognize it as true
enlightenment. The reality is that O'Murchu's *Quantum Theology* is
neither science nor [theology](Theology "Theology"); it is one
man's breathless sales pitch for a rather typical post-Christian
spirituality.

## Summary

Key elements of O'Murchu's *Quantum Theology* are revealed in the
following quotes:

-   it encourages the reader to set aside all critical thinking:
    "And please leave at home your religious and scientific ideologies
    along with the dualisms you have inherited, which you tend to use
    to divide life into right and wrong, earth and
    [heaven](Heaven "Heaven")." [page 7]
-   it is unapologetically anti-Christian, suggesting that
    [Christianity](Christianity "Christianity") (and all organized
    religion) should be abandoned "What we cannot escape is that we as
    a species have outlived that phase of our evolutionary development
    and so, quite appropriately (it seems to me), thousands of people
    are leaving [religion](Religion "Religion") aside..." [page 13]
-   the "scientific" content, primarily contained in Chapter 3, is
    a "gee whiz" smoke and mirrors tour through selected tidbits of
    modern physics, with no explanation of the scientific foundations
    and a heavy emphasis on unconventional interpretations of "what it
    all means" to non-scientists: "Meanwhile, scholars of other
    disciplines detect far-reaching implications of the quantum theory
    for their respective fields (e.g. Chopra 1989, McFadden 2000, Zohar
    1990, 1993, Wheatley 1992) leading to radical new understandings of
    this theory, often baffling and bemusing to mainstream
    scientists... They describe a new and more profound way of
    understanding reality, in fact, one known to mystics for several
    thousand years." [page 29]
-   it explicitly rejects
    [creation *ex nihilo*](Creation_ex_nihilo "Creation ex nihilo")
    asserting instead a form of
    [panentheism](Panentheism "Panentheism"): "In quantum theology, the
    creative potential emerges (evolves) from *within* the cosmos."
    [page 56, italics in the original]
-   it rejects not only the
    [authority of the Bible](Authority_of_the_Bible "Authority of the Bible"),
    but even its significance: "Quantum theology abhors the human
    tendency to attribute literal significance to the sacred writings
    of the various religions." [page 57]
-   it promotes a new approach to morality based on the good of the
    whole: "Morality, in the quantum context, attends first to the
    whole and only secondarily to the parts composing the whole... If
    the [Ten Commandments](Ten_Commandments "Ten Commandments") were
    rewritten in the light of this guideline, what would they look
    like?" [page 160]

## Influence

Quantum Theology has received widespread visibility and apparent
support from some [liberal](Liberalism "Liberalism") Christians,
particularly within the Roman Catholic and
[Anglican](Anglicanism "Anglicanism") churches in North America.
For example:

-   the
    [National Catholic Reporter](http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/todaystake/tt012704.htm)
    gave the book a positive review, noting "...quantum theology tells
    us that the birth of the Buddha, the emergence of Hinduism, the
    journey of Judaism, and the person of Jesus do not exist in
    isolation from each other."
-   the catholic social justice organization
    [Call to Action](http://www.cta-usa.org/) featured O'Murchu at
    their 2004 conference
-   Vancouver's Anglican Christ Church Cathedral:
    -   hosted a
        [lecture by O'Murchu in 2004](http://www.vst.edu/pdfs/OmurchuBrochure.pdf),
    -   warmly recommended Quantum Theology in the "Dean's Notes" of
        April 24, 2005: "Catholic theologian Diarmuid O’Murchu, in his
        excellent book Quantum Theology: Spiritual Implications of the New
        Physics, in an appendix entitled Doing Theology in a Space-Time
        Continuum writes about the major challenges facing theologians —
        growing out of the insights of science:"
    -   are again featuring
        [two talks on quantum theology in November 2006](http://www.cathedral.vancouver.bc.ca/news_info/wed.htm)


This support is difficult to explain given, as noted above, the
book's open opposition to the organized church.
