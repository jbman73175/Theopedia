R. A. Torrey
**Reuben Archer Torrey** (1856-1928), American evangelist, pastor,
educator, and writer. He graduated from Yale University in 1875 and
Yale divinity School in 1878, following which, Torrey became a
Congregational minister in Garrettsville, Ohio.^[[1]](#note-0)^

After further studies of theology at Leipzig University and
Erlangen University in 1882-1883, Torrey joined
[Dwight L. Moody](Dwight_L._Moody "Dwight L. Moody") in his
evangelistic work in Chicago in 1889, and became superintendent of
the Bible Institute of the Chicago Evangelization Society (now
Moody Bible Institute). Five years later, he became pastor of the
Chicago Avenue Church (now The Moody Church) in 1894.

In 1902–1903, he preached in nearly every part of the
English-speaking world, and with song leader Charles Alexander,
conducted revival services in Great Britain in 1903–1905. During
this period, he also visited China, Japan, Australia, and India.
Torrey conducted a similar campaign in American and Canadian cities
in 1906–1907. Throughout these campaigns, Torrey utilized a meeting
style that he borrowed from Moody's campaigns of the 1870s.

In 1912, he served as Dean of Bible Institute of Los Angeles (now
[Biola University](Biola_University "Biola University")) and in
1915, pastor of the Church of the Open Door, Los Angeles.
