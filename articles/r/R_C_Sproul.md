many articles for [evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism")
publications. He signed the 1978
*[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy](Chicago_Statement_on_Biblical_Inerrancy "Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy")*,
which affirmed the traditional view of Biblical
[inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy"), and he wrote a commentary on
that document titled *Explaining Inerrancy*. He also served as the
editor of the *Reformation Study Bible*
([ISBN 0875526438](http://www.theopedia.com/Special:BookSources/0875526438)),
which has appeared in several editions and was also known as the
*New Geneva Study Bible*.

Sproul's work *The Holiness of God* is considered a modern classic
on the subject of God's character, and his book
*Not a Chance: The Myth of Chance in Modern Science and Cosmology*
was highly praised by those who reject the materialism advocated by
some in the scientific
community.^[[1]](http://www.ldolphin.org/chance.html)^
