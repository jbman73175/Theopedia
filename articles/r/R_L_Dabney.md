R. L. Dabney
**Robert Lewis Dabney** (March 5, 1820 - January 3, 1898) was an
American [theologian](Theologian "Theologian"), a Southern
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian"), and chaplain, chief of
staff, and biographer to Stonewall Jackson. He studied at
Hampden-Sydney College and the University of Virginia (M.A., 1842),
and was graduated at Union Theological Seminary in 1846.

He was then a [missionary](Missionary "Missionary") in Louisa
County, Virginia from 1846 to 1847 and pastor at Tinkling Spring,
Virginia from 1847 to 1853, being also head master of a classical
school for a portion of this time. From 1853 to 1859 he was
professor of ecclesiastical history and polity and from 1859 to
1869 adjunct professor of
[systematic theology](Systematic_theology "Systematic theology") in
Union Theological Seminary. He then became full professor of the
latter subject and held this position until 1883, when he was
appointed professor of mental and moral philosophy in the
University of Texas. In 1894 failing health compelled him to retire
from active life, although he still lectured occasionally.

He was copastor of the Hampden-Sidney College Church 1858 to 1874,
also serving Hampden-Sidney College in a professorial capacity on
occasions of vacancies in its faculty. During the vacation of 1861
he was chaplain of the Virginia troops in the Confederate army, and
in the following year was chief of staff to Stonewall Jackson in
the brilliant Valley Campaign. While at the University of Texas he
practically founded and maintained the Austin School of Theology,
and in 1870 was moderator of the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church, South. In theology he was a conservative
[Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism").

He wrote Memoir of Rev. Dr. Francis S. Sampson (1855), whose
commentary on Hebrews he likewise edited (1857); Life of General
Thomas J. Jackson (1866); Defense of Virginia and the South (1867);
Treatise on Sacred Rhetoric (1870); Theology, Dogmatic and Polemic
(1871); Sensualistic Philosophy of the Nineteenth Century Examined
(1875); Practical Philosophy (1896); and the posthumous Penal
Character of the
[Atonement of Christ](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ")
Discussed in the Light of Recent Popular Heresies (1898) on the
satisfaction view of the atonement. A number of his shorter essays
have been edited by C. R. Vaughan under the title Discussions (four
volumes from 1890-1897).
