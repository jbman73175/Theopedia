The **Radical Reformation** is a term usually referring to those
16th century groups who rejected both the Roman Catholic tradition
and the ongoing Protestant alternatives to it, in the name of what
they considered truer forms of Christianity, most notably those who
became known as [Anabaptists](Anabaptist "Anabaptist"). As a
result, they were persecuted by Catholics and Protestants alike and
their ideas and lives were bitterly attacked, often without a
genuine knowledge of what they stood for.

## Background

Early forms of the Radical Reformation were often millenarian,
focusing on the imminent end of the world. This was particularly
notable in the rule of John of Leiden over the city of Münster in
1535, which was ultimately crushed by the forces of the Catholic
Bishop of Münster and the Lutheran Landgrave of Hesse. After the
fall of Münster, several small groups continued to adhere to
revolutionary Anabaptist beliefs. The largest and most important of
these groups, the Batenburgers, persisted in various forms into the
1570s.

In contrast to Roman Catholicism, mainstream Evangelical
([Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran")) and Reformed
([Zwinglian](Huldrych_Zwingli "Huldrych Zwingli"),
[Calvinist](Calvinist "Calvinist")) Protestant movements, the
Radical Reformation generally abandoned the idea of the "Church
Visible" as distinct from the "Church Invisible." Thus, the Church
only consisted of the tiny community of believers, who accepted
Jesus Christ by adult baptism, called
["believer's baptism"](Believer's_baptism "Believer's baptism").

Later forms of Anabaptism were much smaller, and focused on the
formation of small, separatist communities. Among the many
varieties to develop were [Mennonites](Mennonites "Mennonites"),
[Amish](index.php?title=Amish&action=edit&redlink=1 "Amish (page does not exist)"),
and
[Hutterites](index.php?title=Hutterites&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hutterites (page does not exist)").

In addition to the Anabaptists, other strains of the Radical
Reformation have been identified. Notably, George Hunston Williams,
the great categorizer of the Radical Reformation, considered early
forms of [Unitarianism](Unitarianism "Unitarianism") (such as that
of the
[Socinians](index.php?title=Socinians&action=edit&redlink=1 "Socinians (page does not exist)"),
and exemplified by Michael Servetus), and other trends that
disregarded the [Nicene](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed")
[christology](Christology "Christology") still accepted by both
Catholics, Orthodox, and the two larger Protestant groups, as part
of the Radical Reformation.
