**Ransom** is one of the metaphors employed by the early church to
speak of the saving work of Christ. It is found on the lips of
Jesus in Mark 10:45 / Matt. 20:28, "The Son of man came not to be
ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom
for many." Paul also states that Christ gave himself as a "ransom
for all" (I Tim. 2:6). As a metaphor ransom commonly points to a
price paid, a transaction made, to obtain the freedom of others.
These ideas are supported also by such expressions as "buying" and
"price" (I Cor. 6:20) and "redeem" (1 Pet.
1:18ff).^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Ransom theory of atonement

A Ransom Theory of Christ's atonement became prevalent in the early
church. It is difficult to find the origin of this theory, but it
dates from at least [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") (ca. 125-202).
The view was particularly prominent in the Greek Church around the
time of [Origen](Origen "Origen") and ultimately became predominant
in the Post-Nicene Church.

As Irenaeus took it, Jesus had ransomed the Church by his blood.
This much is supported by Scripture according to the words of Jesus
[Matt 20:28, Mark 10:45], Paul [1 Tim 2:6] and John [Rev 5:9]. It
appears that Irenaeus believed the ransom was paid to God, but it
is Origen (ca. 185-254) who raises the question to whom the ransom
was paid, and denies that it was paid to God, affirming that it was
paid to the Devil.
