The **Rapture** is the popular term used to describe one perceived
view of the [Lord's return](Parousia "Parousia") based on the
writings of the [Apostle](Apostle "Apostle") [Paul](Paul "Paul") in
1 Thessalonians 4:17. The word "rapture" comes from the Latin
*rapere* used by the [Vulgate](Vulgate "Vulgate") to translate the
[Greek](Greek "Greek") word *harpazō*, which is rendered by the
phrase "caught up" in most English translations. See below:

"For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of
command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the
trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who
are alive, who are left, will be **caught up** together with them
in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be
with the Lord." (1 Thess. 4:16-17, [ESV](ESV "ESV"))
It is the term used primarily in
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") to refer
to the "catching up" of believers who are alive at the Lord's
return, which they see as an event preceding the Lord's "official"
[second coming](Second_coming "Second coming"), and the setting up
of his
[millennial Kingdom](Millennial_Kingdom "Millennial Kingdom") on
earth. Dispensational premillennialists distinguish the rapture
from Christ's second coming to earth. The degree to which the
rapture is secret or public is a separate issue. The timing of the
rapture is associated with a final period of
[Tribulation](Tribulation "Tribulation") anticipated by Scripture.

## Variations

### Pre-tribulation Rapture

The majority view taught in
[dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism"), is
referred to as the Pre-Tribulation Rapture. This is the belief that
the Rapture will occur sometime prior to the beginning of "Daniel's
70th Week," interpreted as the final seven years of this age. In
this view, believers will be translated into immortal bodies in the
Rapture before the great persecutions by the Antichrist and seven
years of [Tribulation](Tribulation "Tribulation"). Central passages
for this view include 1 Thessalonians 4-5, Revelation 3:10, and all
the passages that describe the Tribulation, but lack the word
ekklesia in them (e.g., Daniel 9; 12; The Olivet Discourse; and
Rev. 4-18.)

According to this view, the Christian Church (that existed prior to
this seven year period) has no vital role in Daniel's seventieth
week and is therefore removed from the scene while God completes
his program for Israel. The pre-trib rapture is the view
popularized through the work of dispensational preachers such as
[Hal Lindsey](Hal_Lindsey "Hal Lindsey") and
[Tim LaHaye](Tim_LaHaye "Tim LaHaye") in his recent *Left Behind*
novel series. However, the definitive works on the subject include
John Walvoord's *The Rapture Question,* J. Dwight Pentecost's
*Things to Come,* and Charles Ryrie's *Dispensationalism* Today.

### Mid-tribulation or Mid-Daniel's 70th Week

"Mid-tribulation Rapture" is what Pre-tribulationalists call the
view that the Rapture occurs in the middle of Daniel's 70th week.
Daniel's 70th week (Dan. 9) is popularly called "the Tribulation,"
even if Mat. 24 effectively calls *only the second half* of
Daniel's 70th week the *Tribulation* and the first half "The
Beginning of Sorrows." Since "Mid-tribulationists" may use the more
strict definition of "Tribulation" (last half of Daniel's 70th
week), from their point of view they may be Pre-tribulationists.
The "Mid-Daniel's 70th Week" view is not limited to
dispensationalists and can be found in **anti**-dispensationalist
James Oliver Buswell's *Systematic Theology.* Buswell was Dean of
Graduate Faculty, Covenant College, St. Louis,
Missouri.^[[1]](#note-0)^([TKay](http://www.theopedia.com/User:TKay "User:TKay")
15:48, 26 June 2010 (UTC))

### Post-tribulation

The other main view is termed the Post Tribulation Rapture. This
view recognizes the concept of "rapture" from 1 Thessalonians
4:13-17, but believes the rapture is part of the first resurrection
as described in 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 and takes place at the
"second coming" of Christ.

"The post-trib view is the only rapture view which sees only a
single future coming of Jesus. All other rapture views, pre-trib,
mid-trib, and pre-wrath, see the rapture and resurrection prior to
the second coming of Jesus by months or years. While these rapture
views see the rapture as a means to take the Church to heaven to
escape God's wrath, the post-trib view sees the rapture as a
mechanism to gather together believers from both heaven and earth
in a single location with Christ, to be revealed with Him in glory
to the world at His coming."
[Warner](http://www.geocities.com/lasttrumpet_2000/index.html)

### Unrevealed Imminency

This relatively new position is postulated by some at
[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School](Trinity_Evangelical_Divinity_School "Trinity Evangelical Divinity School").
The view is that the Scriptures are intentionally unclear about
when the rapture occurs. This leaves the believer expecting the
rapture at any time before or during the Tribulation. The advantage
of this position is that it coincides with the idea of imminency
(Jesus could return at any moment like a "thief in the night")
evidenced in the New Testament and in the writings of the Church
Fathers while allowing for the possibility of seeing the Antichrist
rise to power (2 Thessalonians 2:5ff). This position has not been
given much publicity, but it avoids some of the liabilities of the
above positions.
^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

### Pre-wrath rapture

This view was developed by Marvin Rosenthal;^[[2]](#note-1)^ it is
almost (but not quite) a Post-Trib position, but differs in one
regard: Rosenthal believes Jesus will return for believers just
prior to the
[Battle of Armageddon](index.php?title=Battle_of_Armageddon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Battle of Armageddon (page does not exist)"),
near the very end of the
[Great Tribulation](index.php?title=Great_Tribulation&action=edit&redlink=1 "Great Tribulation (page does not exist)").
This solves a problem in Post-Trib
[eschatology](Eschatology "Eschatology"), namely, how can
immortalized (raptured) believers enter the Millennium and have
children? Since the mass conversion of Israel (and it is assume
some others) occurs in the context of the Battle of Armageddon,
this allows mortal believers to enter and populate the Millennial
Kingdom.

### Partial rapture

This view states that those who are actively looking for the return
of Christ will be raptured. The Christians who are not looking for
his return and are being lazy in their Christians lives will miss
the rapture
event.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

### Secret vs. Open Rapture

{{[Content and references needed.}}

## Criticism of a separate "rapture"

The doctrine of the rapture as an event separate from the general
resurrection is a fairly recent doctrinal development within the
scope of the Church's historic body of
belief.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
Prior to 1830, most of the 'rapture texts' were regarded as
referring to the
[General Resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection"). This was
especially the case with the 1 Thessalonians 4 passage which was
primarily regarded as referring to the resurrection rather than a
rapture.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

Virtually no prominent theologians held to this theory before
[Darby](John_Nelson_Darby "John Nelson Darby")'s influence in the
1840’s.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
For example, none of the great reformers, e.g.
[Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther")^[[3]](#note-2)^ or
[Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin")^[[4]](#note-3)^, believed in a
"Secret Rapture" theory. Nor did the ancient church fathers such as
[John Chrysostom](John_Chrysostom "John Chrysostom"),
[Justin Martyr](Justin_Martyr "Justin Martyr"),
[Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus"),
[Hippolytus](index.php?title=Hippolytus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Hippolytus (page does not exist)")
expressly assert the theory of the pre-tribulation rapture, with
the possible exception that The Shepherd of Hermas, 1.4.2 speaks of
not going through the Tribulation.^[[5]](#note-4)^

Some Reformed theologians are still favorable of using the term
"rapture" but insist on making a very clear distinction between
**rapture** as a synonym for **resurrection** and what
Dispensationalists propose by the term, namely an escape from a
yet-future tribulation period.
[John Stott](John_Stott "John Stott") calls this idea "escapism" in
his book *Issues Facing Christians Today* (2006, 4th ed.). He goes
on to write that the Dispensational concept of a "secret
rapture"^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
is one of the most destructive doctrines gripping the Evangelical
Church today. According to Stott, it thwarts planning, hinders
social involvement, and gives Christians a gloomy outlook for the
future.

Other texts used by proponents of a separate
rapture,^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
such as Matthew 24:40 -
*Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left.*,
when taken in context (especially Christ's statement in Matthew
24:34) are seen by some [Preterists](Preterism "Preterism") as
predictions of the Roman catapult bombardment of Jerusalem during
the 42 month siege of Jerusalem from late 66-70 AD, not to a
rapture. While Dispensationalists claim that the predictions in
Matthew 24 are yet-future, centering on a
secret-rapture,^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
critics maintain that an exegesis of this passage reveals that this
is at best unlikely, if not biblically and historically impossible
(cf.
[*The Most Embarrassing Verse In The Bible*](http://www.andrewcorbett.net/mev-ad.html)
by Andrew Corbett).

## Argument Vs. a Rapture in the Olivet Discourse

It is common in English to express the direction of a verb by
adding an adverb to it, as in "take in," "take up," "take down,"
"take away." The basic word for "take" in Greek is *lambanō*. In
Greek, the directional aspect of a verb is instead often expressed
as a prefix to the verb – such as *para* which means "to" or *ana*
which means "up."^[[6]](#note-5)^ In Matthew 24:40 and the parallel
passage in Luke 17:34-36, the word to "take" is the Greek word
*paralambanō*
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#3880](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=3880&version=nas)]*^)
meaning to "take to oneself," that is, to receive near or associate
with oneself. If the writer had wished to express the direction
"up" he could have used the prefix *ana* to *lambanō.*

In Acts 1:11, Luke does use the word *analambanō*
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#353](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=353&version=nas)]*^)
because there he is describing Jesus being taken up into heaven. He
could also have used another Greek word to express the idea of
"lifting up." The Greek verb *epairō*
(^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#1869](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=1869&version=nas)]*^)
is used to describe God taking Jesus up to heaven in Acts 1:9. Luke
wrote both the gospel and the book of Acts. If in Luke 17:34 he had
wanted to say that we are going to be taken up into heaven he would
have used one of the two words that he used to describe Jesus being
"taken up" in Acts.

It is not clear what Matthew and Luke meant by word "taken". Many
believe the context supports a reference to end times *judgment*
rather than to salvation. In Matthew 27:27 and John 19:16 the same
word – *paralambanō* - describes Jesus’ arrest.
