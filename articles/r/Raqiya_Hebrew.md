**Raqiya** is a [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew") word that has been
translated as "firmament" ([KJV](KJV "KJV"), [ASV](ASV "ASV")),
"expanse" ([NIV](NIV "NIV"), [ESV](ESV "ESV"),
[NASB](NASB "NASB")), "dome" ([NRSV](NRSV "NRSV")), and "vault"
([TNIV](TNIV "TNIV"), [NJB](NJB "NJB")). The term and its referent
are relevant to our understanding of ancient culture,
[interpretations of the creation account](Interpretations_of_the_creation_account "Interpretations of the creation account"),
and the possible condition of the earth prior to the
[Genesis Flood](Genesis_Flood "Genesis Flood").

## Differing views

[G. K. Beale](G._K._Beale "G. K. Beale") explains,

"Some believe that the [raqiya] was rock-solid and formed a dome
over the earth, reflecting the [ANE](ANE "ANE") mythological
viewpoint without any qualification or critique... For example, P.
H. Seely argues for such a view in an
[article published in the *Westminster Theological Journal*](http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/OTeSources/01-Genesis/Text/Articles-Books/Seely-Firmament-WTJ.pdf).
He contends that the [raqiya\`] in Genesis 1:6, 14, 17, 20 and in
Ezekiel must be considered solid since this was the common ANE
view, both from the mythological perspective and from the viewpoint
of the ancient common person."^[[1]](#note-0)^
P.H. Seely himself writes,

"[S]cientifically naive peoples employed their concept of a solid
sky in their mythology, but that they nevertheless thought of the
solid sky as an integral part of their physical universe. And it is
precisely because ancient peoples were scientifically naive that
they did not distinguish between the appearance of the sky and
their scientific concept of the sky. They had no reason to doubt
what their eyes told them was true, namely, that the stars above
them were fixed in a solid dome and that the sky literally touched
the earth at the horizon. So, they equated appearance with reality
and concluded that the sky must be a solid physical part of the
universe just as much as the earth itself...
"[N]aive peoples around the world from the Pacific Islands to North
America, from Siberia to Africa, have perceived the sky as a solid
inverted bowl touching the earth at the horizon. Nor is this common
conception of a firmament merely myth, metaphor, or phenomenal
language. It is an integral part of their scientific view of the
universe. It is within the context of geography, astronomy, and
natural science that they really believe that if they would travel
far enough they could 'touch the sky with one's fingers,' that
migrating birds live 'on the other side of the celestial vault,'
that an arrow or lance could 'fasten in the sky,' that the sky can
have 'a hole in it,' that at the horizon 'the dome of the sky is
too close to earth to permit navigation,' that where the sky
touches the earth you can 'lean a pestle against it' or 'climb up
it,' that the sky is 'smooth and hard. . . of solid rock, . . . as
thick as a house,' that the sky can 'fall down' and someday 'will
fall down crushing the earth.'
"Equally important, this perception of the firmament is not
selective. It is almost completely universal. True, there are
occasional variations on the solid dome conception, such as several
worlds piled up on top of each other, each with its own firmament;
but I know of no evidence that any scientifically naive people
anywhere on earth believed that the firmament was just empty space
or atmosphere. The only exception to this is the Chinese and that
not until AD 200. Apart from a scientific education, it is just too
natural for people to think of the sky as something solid. So true
is this that it is generally regarded by scholars as 'the usual
primitive conception.' One scholar goes so far as to call it 'a
general human belief.'"^[[2]](#note-1)^
Seely furthermore argues that we do not have "any evidence from
biblical times that suggests the Hebrews were ever more
scientifically sophisticated than their neighbors", and that
"patriarchs and Abraham in particular... most likely held the
Babylonian view of the sky as solid." Additionally, Moses "was
schooled in the thinking of the Egyptians. That schooling would
certainly have included the assumption that the sky was solid". He
assures however that "Genesis 1 is free of the mythological and
polytheistic religious concepts of the ancient Near East... [T]he
religious knowledge of Israel, though clearly superior to that of
its neighbors, was expressed through the religious cultural forms
of the time."^[[3]](#note-2)^

The view of the expanse as a literal firmament was shared by
"virtually everyone else up to the time of the Renaissance!" Of the
Jews and early Christians Seely writes,

"Jews speculated as to what material the firmament was made of:
clay or copper or iron (*3 Apoc. Bar.* 3.7). They differentiated
between the firmament and the empty space or air between it and the
earth (*Gen. Rab.* 4.3.a; *2 Apoc. Bar.* 21.4). They tried to
figure out how thick it was by employing biblical interpretation
(*Gen. Rab.* 4.5.2). Most tellingly they even tried to calculate
scientifically the thickness of the firmament (*Pesab.* 49a).
"Christians speculated as to whether it was made of earth, air,
fire, or water (the basic elements of Greek science). Origen called
the firmament "without doubt firm and solid"
(*First Homily on Genesis*, FC 71). Ambrose, commenting on Gen 1:6,
said, 'the specific solidity of this exterior firmament is meant'
(*Hexameron*, FC 42.60). Augustine said the word firmament was used
'to indicate not that it is motionless but that it is solid and
that it constitutes an impassable boundary between the waters above
and the waters below' (*The Literal Meaning of Genesis*, ACW
41.1.61)."^[[4]](#note-3)^
G. K. Beale, opposing this view, writes, "[W]e just do not know
that all ancients believed the sky was a solid dome or that there
was anything near unanimity on this point."^[[5]](#note-4)^ Hugh
Ross also takes exception to this view of the
expanse.^[[6]](#note-5)^
