**Rationalism** as a philosophy stresses reason as the means of
determining truth. Mind is given authority over sense, the
*[w:a priori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_priori "w:a priori")*
over the
*[w:a posteriori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a_posteriori "w:a posteriori")*.
Rationalists are usually
[foundationalists](index.php?title=Foundationalists&action=edit&redlink=1 "Foundationalists (page does not exist)"),
who affirm that there are first principles of knowledge, without
which no knowledge is possible. For a rationalist, reason
arbitrates [truth](Truth "Truth"), and truth is objective.

Although
[w:Aristotle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "w:Aristotle")
(384-322 B.C.) believed that knowledge began in the senses, his
stress on reason and logic made him the father of Western
rationalism.
[w:René Descartes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Descartes "w:René Descartes")
(1596-1650),
[w:Benedict Spinoza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Spinoza "w:Benedict Spinoza")
(1632-1677), and
[w:Gottfried Leibniz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "w:Gottfried Leibniz")
(1646-1716) were the chief modern rationalists.^[[1]](#note-0)^
^[[2]](#note-1)^ ^[[3]](#note-2)^

Most [worldviews](Worldview "Worldview") have at least one major
rationalist proponent. Leibniz embraced
[theism](Theism "Theism").^[[4]](#note-3)^ Spinoza held to
[pantheism](Pantheism "Pantheism").^[[5]](#note-4)^
[w:Ayn Rand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand "w:Ayn Rand")
(1905-1977) professed [atheism](Atheism "Atheism").^[[6]](#note-5)^
Most [deists](Deists "Deists") held some form of rationalism. Even
pantheism is represented by strong rationalistic proponents, such
as
[w:Charles Hartshorne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hartshorne "w:Charles Hartshorne")
(1897-2000).^[[7]](#note-6)^
[Finite godism](index.php?title=Finite_godism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Finite godism (page does not exist)")
has been rationally defended by
[w:John Stuart Mill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill "w:John Stuart Mill")
(1806-1873) and others.^[[8]](#note-7)^

The reason that various worldviews all have forms of rationalism is
that rationalism is an [epistemology](Epistemology "Epistemology"),
whereas a worldview is an aspect of
[metaphysics](Metaphysics "Metaphysics"). Rationalism is a means of
discerning truth, and most worldviews have exponents who use it to
determine and defend truth as they see it.^[[9]](#note-8)^

## Central Premises

### Premises Shared by Rationalists

Some ideas are common to virtually all rationalists. These include
the following factors, even though some rationlists defend them,
modify them, or limit them in ways others do not.

-   *Foundationalism*. Foundationalism believes that there are
    first principles of all knowledge, such as the
    [principle of noncontradiction](Law_of_noncontradiction "Law of noncontradiction"),
    the
    [principle of identity](index.php?title=Law_of_identity&action=edit&redlink=1 "Law of identity (page does not exist)"),
    and the
    [principle of the excluded middle](index.php?title=Law_of_the_excluded_middle&action=edit&redlink=1 "Law of the excluded middle (page does not exist)").
    Certain foundationalists believer there are other principles,
    either the
    [principle of sufficient reason](index.php?title=Principle_of_sufficient_reason&action=edit&redlink=1 "Principle of sufficient reason (page does not exist)")
    or the
    [principle of causality](index.php?title=Principle_of_causality&action=edit&redlink=1 "Principle of causality (page does not exist)").
    All rationalists are foundationalists, and all foundationalists
    believe in some foundational principles.

-   *Objectivism*. Rationalists also believe that there is an
    objective reality and that it can be known by human reason. This
    distinguishes them from
    [mysticism](index.php?title=Mysticism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mysticism (page does not exist)"),
    [existentialism](Existentialism "Existentialism"), and other forms
    of
    [subjectivism](index.php?title=Subjectivism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Subjectivism (page does not exist)").
    For a rationalist, the real is rational, and reason is the means of
    determining what is real.

-   *Exclusivism*. Rationalists are also exclusivists. They believe
    that mutually exclusive opposites cannot both be true. According to
    the law of non-contradiction, if atheism is true, then all
    non-atheism is false. If Christianity is true, then all
    non-Christian systems are false. But opposite truth claims cannot
    both be true.

-   *A Priorism*. All rationalists believe there is an *a priori*
    element to knowledge. Reason is in some sense independent of
    experience. Even rationalists who are also
    [empiricists](index.php?title=Empiricists&action=edit&redlink=1 "Empiricists (page does not exist)")
    (i.e. [Thomas Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas"),
    [w:Aristotle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "w:Aristotle"),
    and [w:Leibniz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz "w:Leibniz")),
    believe that there is nothing in the mind that was not first in the
    senses except the mind itself. Without this *a priori* (independent
    of experience) dimension to knowledge, nothing could be
    known.^[[10]](#note-9)^

## Differences Among Rationalists

### The Role of the Senses

Some rationalists downplay, if not negate, any determinative role
of the senses in the knowing process. They stress the rational
exclusively.
[w:Spinoza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinoza "w:Spinoza") is an
example of this view. Others combine sense and reason, such as
[Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") and
[w:Leibniz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz "w:Leibniz"). The
former are more
[deductive](index.php?title=Deductive&action=edit&redlink=1 "Deductive (page does not exist)")
in their approach to learning truth; the latter are more
[inductive](index.php?title=Inductive&action=edit&redlink=1 "Inductive (page does not exist)")
and
[inferential](index.php?title=Inferential&action=edit&redlink=1 "Inferential (page does not exist)").

### The Limits of Reason

A crucial difference among rationalists is found in the scope of
reason. Some rationalists, such as
[w:Spinoza](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinoza "w:Spinoza"), give
reason an all-encompassing scope. It is the sole means of
determining truth. Others, such as
[Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas"), believe reason is
capable of discovering some truths (i.e. the existence of God), but
not all truth (i.e. the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity")).^[[11]](#note-10)^ Those in the
latter category believe that there are truths that are in accord
with reason and some that go beyond reason. Even the latter are not
*contrary* to reason. They simply are *beyond* the ability of
reason to attain on its own. They can be known only from
[special revelation](Special_revelation "Special revelation").

## Evaluation

Rationalism as a whole has both positive and negative dimensions
for an apologists. Unlimited rationalism that denies all special
revelation, obviously is unacceptable for a theist. Nor is any form
of rationalism that denies theism in accord with orthodox
Christianity.

However, foundationalism's stress on the need for first principles,
is both true and valuable. Also valuable is the belief in objective
truth. The rationalist's emphasis on the exclusive nature of truth
claims is also a benefit to Christian apologetics.

From a Christian perspective, the rationalist theologian
[Jonathan Edwards](Jonathan_Edwards "Jonathan Edwards") made an
important distinction: All truth is given by revelation, either
general or special, and it must be received by reason. Reason is
the God-given means for discovering the truth that God discloses,
whether in his world or his Word. While God wants to reach the
heart with truth, he does not bypass the mind along the
way.^[[12]](#note-11)^ In this modified sense, there is great value
in Christian rationalism.
