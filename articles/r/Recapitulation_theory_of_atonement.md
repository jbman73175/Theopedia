The **Recapitulation Theory of Atonement** "sees the atonement of
Christ as reversing the course of mankind from disobedience to
obedience. It believes that Christ’s life recapitulated all the
stages of human life and in doing so reversed the course of
disobedience initiated by Adam."^[[1]](#note-0)^

This view originated with [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus") (125-202
AD). He sees Christ as the new Adam, who systematically undoes what
Adam did. Thus, where Adam was disobedient concerning God's edict
concerning the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, Christ was obedient
even to death on the wood of a tree. Irenaeus is the first to draw
comparisons between Eve and Mary, contrasting the faithlessness of
the former with the faithfulness of the latter. In addition to
reversing the wrongs done by Adam, Irenaeus thinks of Christ as
"recapitulating" or "summing up" human life.^[[2]](#note-1)^

According to Peter Leithart: In their recent study of patristic
interpretation, John O'Keefe and R R Reno ^[[3]](#note-2)^ point
out that Irenaeus borrows his notion of recapitulation from ancient
rhetoric: "Recapitulation is an English form of recapitulans, the
Latin translation of anakephalaiosis, which means final repetition,
summing up, drawing to conclusion. As a term in rhetoric, it refers
to the end of a speech, when the speaker drives home the point with
a summary of the strongest arguments." In applying this notion to
the life of Jesus, then, Irenaeus is not merely saying that Jesus
"repeats" the history of man or of Israel, but that He is "the
Father's 'summary statement," as well as the "Logos of the Father,
the logic or purpose in and through which the whole divine economy
is conceived and implemented." Behind Irenaeus' use, then, is a
rhetorical conception of redemptive history as the speech of the
Father.^[[4]](#note-3)^
