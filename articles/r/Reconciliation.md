## Reconciliation to God in Christ

"For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him
through the death of his Son, how much more, having been
reconciled, shall we be saved through his life! Not only is this
so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom we have now received reconciliation." (Romans
5:10-11)

## The ministry of reconciliation

"All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ
and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was
reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins
against them. And he has committed to us the message of
reconciliation." (2 Corinthians 5:18-19)
