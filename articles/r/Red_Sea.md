The **Red Sea** is one of the major bodies of water to feature in
the history of Israel. It was the site where God rescued the
children of Israel, bringing them decisively out of Egypt and
simultaneously destroying the Pharaoh's army. Later, the crossing
of the Red Sea would be looked back upon by Israelites as one of
God's mightiest acts in their history, celebrating it in the
Psalms. The Red Sea also functioned, at times, as a boundary for
the kingdom of Israel, as one of the geographical limitations to
the kingdom.

## Quotes

-   "The crossing of Israel . . . cannot be explained as a wading
    through a swamp. It required a mighty act of God, an act so
    significant both in scope and meaning that forever after in
    Israel's history it was the paradigm against which all of his
    redemptive and saving work was measured" (Eugene Merrill,
    *Kingdom of Priests*, Baker Book House, Grand Rapids, 1987, p. 66)

-   "It is commonly suggested that the designation 'Red Sea'
    (*yam sup*) should be rendered 'Sea of Reeds'.� Supposedly then,
    the place at which Israel left Egypt was but a 'marshy'� area that
    was dried out by a temporary wind. This view is argued upon the
    supposition that the Hebrew term *sup* is related to an Egyptian
    word meaning 'reed'.� It is also possible, however, that *sup* may
    relate to the Hebrew term *sop*, which signifies 'end'� or
    'conclusion'� (of the earth), and thus could refer simply to
    several connected bodies of water extending southward from
    Palestine and Arabia (Myers, *Eerdmans Bible Dictionary*, p. 876)

-   "In 1 Kings 9:26 *sup* refers to the Gulf of Aqabah, where
    Solomon's navy was kept. Professor Kenneth Kitchen believes that
    *yam sup* extended from the Egyptian delta north of Suez, along the
    line of the present Suez Canal to the Gulf of Suez and Aqabah—and
    even beyond that area (Douglas, pp. 1077-8). Wherever the exodus
    took place, it was at a point where the sea was deep enough to
    drown the entire Egyptian army."
