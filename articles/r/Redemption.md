**Redemption** means to free someone from bondage. It often
involves the paying of a ransom, a price that ensures redemption.
The Israelites were redeemed from Egypt. We were redeemed from the
power of sin and the curse of the Law (Gal. 3:13) through Jesus
(Rom. 3:24; Col. 1:14). We were bought with a price (1 Cor. 6:20;
7:23).^[[1]](#note-0)^

Redemption is defined by J. I. Packer as "Christ's actual
substitutionary endurance of the penalty of sin in the place of
certain specified sinners, through which God was reconciled to
them, their liability to punishment was for ever destroyed, and a
title to eternal life was secured for them. In consequence of this,
they now have in God's sight a right to the gift of faith, as the
means of entry to the enjoyment of their inheritance. Calvary, in
other words, not merely made possible the salvation of those for
whom Christ died; it ensured that they would be brought to faith
and their salvation be made actual. The Cross
saves."^[[2]](#note-1)^
