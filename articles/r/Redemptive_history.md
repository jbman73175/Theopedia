**Redemptive history** is a general term to describe the study of
God's acts of [redemption](Redemption "Redemption") from creation
to the present. Although a broad field of study, all of redemptive
history can be said to climax and culminate in the Cross,
encompassing [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")' death, burial, and
[resurrection](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus").

## Jesus the central focus

Ephesians 3:11 speaks of God's "eternal purpose that he has
realized in Christ Jesus our Lord" ([ESV](ESV "ESV")). The
[Greek](Greek "Greek") word for "purpose" is in the singular,
noting that God has *one* overarching purpose or plan. Furthermore,
it is described by [Paul](Paul "Paul") as "eternal" in that there
was never a time when God's purpose was not determined. Lastly,
Jesus is essential to this purpose since it was accomplished in
him. This can be linked back to Ephesians 1:9-10 where Paul writes,
"making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his
purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of
time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on
earth." Jesus is thus the climax and central focus of God's eternal
purpose in all of redemptive history.

### The church

The church is also a main focus in God's eternal purpose. Before
Paul states that "this was according to the eternal purpose", he
writes "so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might
now be made known to the rulers nad authorities in the heavenly
places" and then proceeds to say that "this was according to the
eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord"
(Ephesians 3:11). The church is connected to what Christ did to
accomplish God's eternal purpose. Elsewhere Paul says that
Christians were "called according to his purpose" (Romans 8:28),
and that "having been predestined according to the purpose of him
who works all things according to the counsel of his will"
(Ephesians 1:11), and lastly that God "saved us and called us to a
holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own
purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages
began" (2 Timothy 1:9). God's purpose involves the church as the
church is the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27).
