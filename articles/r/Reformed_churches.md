The **Reformed churches** are a group of
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") denominations historically
related by a similar [Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") system of
doctrine but organizationally independent. Each nation in which the
Reformed movement was originally established had its own church
government. Several of these local churches have expanded to
worldwide denominations and most have experienced splits into
multiple denominations. Commitment to teaching the original
Calvinism usually continues to be reflected in their official
definitions of doctrine, but in some cases is no longer necessarily
typical of these churches. A 1999 survey found 746 Reformed
denominations worldwide.

## Source of doctrine

Reformed doctrine is expressed in various
[creeds](Creeds "Creeds"). A few creeds are shared by many
denominations. Different denominations use different creeds,
usually based on historical reasons. Some of the common creeds are
(with year of writing):

-   [Scots Confession](Scots_Confession "Scots Confession") (1560),
-   [Three Forms of Unity](Three_Forms_of_Unity "Three Forms of Unity")
    -   [Heidelberg Catechism](Heidelberg_Catechism "Heidelberg Catechism")
        (1563),
    -   [Belgic Confession](Belgic_Confession "Belgic Confession")
        (1566),
    -   [Canons of Dort](Canons_of_Dort "Canons of Dort") (1619),

-   [Second Helvetic Confession (1566)](http://www.creeds.net/helvetic/)
-   Westminster Standards
    -   [Westminster Confession of Faith](Westminster_Confession_of_Faith "Westminster Confession of Faith")
        (1646)
    -   [Westminster Shorter Catechism](http://www.reformed.org/documents/WSC_frames.html)
        (1649)
    -   [Westminster Larger Catechism](http://www.bethelopc.org/lc.asp)(1649)

-   [London Baptist Confession of 1689](London_Baptist_Confession_of_1689 "London Baptist Confession of 1689")

The Three forms of unity are common among Reformed churches with
origins in the European continent (especially those in the
Netherlands). The Westminster Standards have a similarly common use
among Reformed churches (known as the Presbyterian churches) with
origins in the British Isles. More recent confessions and creeds
are shared by fewer denominations.
