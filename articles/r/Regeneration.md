**Regeneration** is the spiritual transformation in a person,
brought about by the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit"), that
brings the individual from being spiritually dead to become a
spiritually alive human being. **Regeneration** is another way of
speaking about the *new birth* or the *second birth* or being
*born again.*^[[1]](#note-Piper)^

This subjective change worked in one's soul by the grace of God is
variously designated in Scripture as a new birth, a resurrection, a
new life, a new creature, a renewing of the mind, a dying to sin
and living to righteousness, a translation from darkness to light,
etc. In theological language, it is called regeneration,
renovation, and conversion. These terms are often used
interchangeably.^[[2]](#note-Hodge)^

According to Hodge's *Systematic Theology,* the word *regeneration*
is used almost universally to refer to the instantaneous change
from spiritual death to spiritual life. He says it is not used to
designate "the whole work of sanctification, nor the first stages
of that work comprehended in conversion, much less justification or
any mere external change of state."^[[2]](#note-Hodge)^ In calling
it a spiritual resurrection—the beginning of a new life, Hodge
adds, "Sometimes the word expresses the *act* of God. God
regenerates. Sometimes it designates the subjective *effect* of his
act" (emphasis added).

## Etymology

The word for *regeneration* in Titus 3:5 is the Greek word
*palingenesias.* It is used only one other place in the entire
Bible—Matthew 19:28. Jesus says to the twelve apostles, “Truly, I
say to you, in *the new world* (lit. "in the regeneration" [Greek
*en te palingenesia*])^[[1]](#note-Piper)^ when the Son of Man will
sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit
on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” This is a
reference to the rebirth of the creation--“in the new heavens and
the new earth” (Isaiah 65:17, 66:22).

One's inherently sinful nature is profoundly and miraculously
changed by regeneration—the new birth—so that person can respond to
[God](God "God") in Faith, and live in accordance with His will
(Matt. 19:28; John 3:3,5,7; Titus 3:5). No one can come alive to
God apart from the Spirit’s work.^[[3]](#note-0)^

## Applies to the whole of Creation

John Piper points out that the new birth is conceived by Jesus as
something that will happen to all creation, not just human beings.
He explains that this is because the whole of creation is defiled
and disordered as result of the Fall (Romans 8:20-23). The whole
universe will replace its futility and corruption and disease and
degeneration and disasters with a whole new order—a new heaven and
a new earth. Therefore, the new birth for an individual person may
be seen as "the first installment of the final, universal
regeneration of the universe."

## New Birth

Jesus said that unless we are born again (or “born from above”), we
will not see the kingdom of God (John 3:3). Regarding why
individuals need this regeneration, Piper points to the poignant
description of the human heart in Titus 3:3 for an explanation: "We
ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to
various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and
envy, hated by others and hating one another."

> The use of the figure of new birth to describe this change
> emphasizes two facts about it.
> 
> -   The first is its decisiveness. The regenerate man has forever
>     ceased to be the man he was; his old life is over and a new life
>     has begun; he is a new creature in Christ, buried with him out of
>     reach of condemnation and raised with him into a new life of
>     righteousness (see Rom. 6:3-11; 2 Cor. 5:17; Col. 3:9-11).
> 
> -   The second fact emphasized is the monergism of regeneration.
>     Infants do not induce, or cooperate in, their own procreation and
>     birth; no more can those who are "dead in trespasses and sins"
>     prompt the quickening operation of God's Spirit within them (see
>     Eph. 2:1-10). Spiritual vivification is a free, and to man
>     mysterious, exercise of divine power (John 3:8), not explicable in
>     terms of the combination or cultivation of existing human resources
>     (John 3:6), not caused or induced by any human efforts (John
>     1:12-13) or merits (Titus 3:3-7), and not, therefore, to be equated
>     with, or attributed to, any of the experiences, decisions, and acts
>     to which it gives rise and by which it may be known to have taken
>     place.

## Meaning of Grace: "But God..."

Piper^[[1]](#note-Piper)^ describes Titus 3: 4 as one of the ‘’most
precious phrases in the Bible’’: “But when the goodness and loving
kindness of God appeared, he [God!] saved us. We were foolish,
disobedient, led astray, slaves to sinful pleasures, malicious,
envious, hated and hating.”

## How the New Birth happens

At the end of Titus 3:5, Paul describes regeneration as a
*cleansing* and a *renewing* by the Holy Spirit. The Spirit gives
life (John 6:63). Jesus says, "I am the way the truth and the life”
(John 14:6). Piper paraphrases this as Jesus saying in effect,
"When the Spirit connects you to me by faith, you experience a new
birth." Piper adds that regeneration provides a *cleansing* from
all that is past and a *renewal* for all that is
future.^[[1]](#note-Piper)^

Seventeenth century renowned theologian
[Thomas Boston](Thomas_Boston "Thomas Boston") cautions that there
are false conceptions in grace. He claims that many are deluded
into mistaking some partial changes they experience for the great
and thorough change known as Regeneration. Some of his points are
these:

-   One may engage in all the outward duties of religion, and yet
    not be born again. They may advance to a great deal of strictness
    in their own way of religion, and yet be strangers to the new
    birth.
-   Sharp soul-exercises and pangs of conscience of themselves do
    not bring about the new birth.
-   Regeneration is a real thorough change, whereby one is made a
    new creature (2 Cor. 5:17). The Lord God makes the creature a new
    creature, "as the goldsmith melts down the vessel of dishonor, and
    makes it a vessel of honor."
-   Regeneration is a change of qualities or dispositions. Vicious
    qualities are removed, and contrary dispositions are replaced.
-   Regeneration is a supernatural change. To be born again is to
    be born of the Spirit (John 3:5).
-   It is a change into the likeness of God. "We, beholding, as in
    a glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image" (2
    Cor. 3:18).
-   It is a universal change; "all things become new" (2 Cor.
    5:17).

In conclusion, J.I. Packer offers this detailed definition:

> Regeneration has been defined as "an inner re-creating of fallen
> human nature by the gracious sovereign action of the Holy Spirit
> (John 3:5-8)." The Bible conceives salvation as the redemptive
> renewal of man on the basis of a restored relationship with God in
> Christ, and presents it as involving "a radical and complete
> transformation wrought in the soul (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) by God
> the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:24), by virtue of which we
> become 'new men' (Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10), no longer conformed to
> this world (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:22; Col. 3:9), but in knowledge and
> holiness of the truth created after the image of God (Eph. 4:24;
> Col. 3:10; Rom. 12:2)".^[[5]](#note-1)^ Regeneration is the "birth"
> by which this work of new creation is begun, as sanctification is
> the "growth" whereby it continues (1 Pet. 2:2; 2 Pet. 3:18).
> Regeneration in Christ changes the disposition from lawless,
> Godless self-seeking (Rom. 3:9-18; 8:7) which dominates man in Adam
> into one of trust and love, of repentance for past rebelliousness
> and unbelief, and loving compliance with God's law henceforth. It
> enlightens the blinded mind to discern spiritual realities (1 Cor.
> 2:14-15; 2 Cor. 4:6; Col. 3:10), and liberates and energizes the
> enslaved will for free obedience to God (Rom. 6:14, 17-22; Phil.
> 2:13).
