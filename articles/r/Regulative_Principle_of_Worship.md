The **Regulative Principle of Worship** is a teaching primarily
emphasized in Reformed churches that the public
[worship](Worship "Worship") of God should include only those
elements that are instituted, commanded, or appointed by command or
example in the [Bible](Bible "Bible"). The
[Westminster Confession of Faith](Westminster_Confession_of_Faith "Westminster Confession of Faith")
provides a very common statement of the Regulative Principle:

"The acceptable way of worshipping the true God is instituted by
Himself, and so limited by His own revealed will, that He may not
be worshipped according to the imaginations and devices of men, or
the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representation, or any
other way not prescribed in the Holy Scripture." (WCF 21.1)
By contrast, what has been termed the "normative principle" teaches
that worship must consist of that which is commanded by God
*but also may include* that which is not specifically prohibited by
Scripture so long as it is agreeable to the peace and unity of the
Church. This is the view found in Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist,
most independant Baptist and Bible churches, as well as in the
Roman Catholic church.

## A quote from Calvin

"Moreover, the rule which distinguishes between pure and vitiated
worship is of universal application, in order that we may not adopt
any device which seems fit to ourselves, but look to the
injunctions of him who alone is entitled to prescribe. Therefore,
if we would have him to approve our worship, this rule, which he
everywhere enforces with the utmost strictness, must be carefully
observed. For there is a twofold reason why the Lord, in condemning
and prohibiting all fictitious worship, requires us to give
obedience only to his own voice. First, it tends greatly to
establish his authority that we do not follow our own pleasure, but
depend entirely on his sovereignty; and, secondly, such is our
folly, that when we are left at liberty, all we are able to do is
to go astray. And then when once we have turned aside from the
right path, there is no end to our wanderings, until we get buried
under a multitude of superstitions. Justly, therefore, does the
Lord, in order to assert his full right of dominion, strictly
enjoin what he wishes us to do, and at once reject all human
devices which are at variance with his command. Justly, too, does
he, in express terms, define our limits, that we may not, by
fabricating perverse modes of worship, provoke his anger against
us." [John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"),
