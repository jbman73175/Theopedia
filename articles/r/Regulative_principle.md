The **Regulative principle** of worship in Christian theology
teaches that the public [worship](Worship "Worship") of God should
include those and only those elements that are instituted,
commanded, or appointed by command or example in the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"). In other words, it is the belief that
[God](God "God") institutes in Scripture whatever he requires for
worship in the Church, and everything else should be avoided.

The "regulative principle" is often contrasted with the
**normative principle** of worship, which teaches that whatever is
not prohibited in Scripture is permitted in worship, so long as it
is agreeable to the peace and unity of the Church. In other words,
there must be agreement with the general practice of the Church and
no prohibition in Scripture for whatever is done in worship.

The regulative principle of worship is generally practiced by the
conservative
[Reformed churches](Reformed_churches "Reformed churches") and in
other conservative [Protestant](Protestantism "Protestantism")
denominations, and it finds expression in confessional documents
such as the
[Westminster Confession of Faith](Westminster_Confession_of_Faith "Westminster Confession of Faith")
and the
[London Baptist Confession of Faith](London_Baptist_Confession_of_1689 "London Baptist Confession of 1689").
The normative principle of worship is the generally accepted
approach to worship outside of Reformed circles as practiced by
[Anglicans](Anglican "Anglican"),
[Methodists](Methodist "Methodist"), [Baptists](Baptist "Baptist"),
and independent Bible Churches.

Some of the "regulative principle" groups reject the use of musical
instruments in worship on this ground
[[1]](http://www.reformed.com/pub/music.htm). Such groups may argue
that there is no example of musical instruments for worship in the
New Testament, and/or that the Old Testament uses of instruments in
worship were specifically tied to the ceremonial laws of the Temple
in Jerusalem (like the Old Testament sacrificial system), and are
not applicable in the church. Many early Calvinists eschewed
musical instruments in worship, and this practice typified
Presbyterians, and other Reformed and Calvinist churches. In recent
times, since the 1800s, most of these churches no longer exclude
instruments.

## The Regulative principle in Calvin

"Moreover, the rule which distinguishes between pure and vitiated
worship is of universal application, in order that we may not adopt
any device which seems fit to ourselves, but look to the
injunctions of him who alone is entitled to prescribe. Therefore,
if we would have him to approve our worship, this rule, which he
everywhere enforces with the utmost strictness, must be carefully
observed. For there is a twofold reason why the Lord, in condemning
and prohibiting all fictitious worship, requires us to give
obedience only to his own voice. First, it tends greatly to
establish his authority that we do not follow our own pleasure, but
depend entirely on his sovereignty; and, secondly, such is our
folly, that when we are left at liberty, all we are able to do is
to go astray. And then when once we have turned aside from the
right path, there is no end to our wanderings, until we get buried
under a multitude of superstitions. Justly, therefore, does the
Lord, in order to assert his full right of dominion, strictly
enjoin what he wishes us to do, and at once reject all human
devices which are at variance with his command. Justly, too, does
he, in express terms, define our limits, that we may not, by
fabricating perverse modes of worship, provoke his anger against
us." ([John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"),
*The Necessity of Reforming the Church*)
