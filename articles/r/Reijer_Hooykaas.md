**Reijer Hooykaas** (August 1, 1906 - January 4, 1994) is one of
the leading Christian historians of science in the world. For many
years, Hooykaas played an active role in the Christian Society of
Scientists and Physicians in the Netherlands. Trained as a Chemist,
in 1945 Hooykaas was appointed first chair in the history of
science at the Free University of Amsterdam. He later served as
professor of the history of science at the University of Utrecht
from 1967 until his retirement in 1976, after which he focused on
his writing and lecturing activities. Much of his work addressed
the scientific fruits of a Reformed Christian faith.

He is remembered fondly, respectfully, and professionally by fellow
historians. His countryman H. Floris Cohen dedicated his magnus
opus *The Scientific Revolution: A Historiographical Inquiry*
(University of Chicago Press, 1994) to Hooykaas and its treatment
on religion deals mostly with Hooykaas.^[[1]](#note-0)^ British
Historian Malcolm Oster remembers him as a loveable curmudgeon who
would become "personally irritated" when other historians would
attempt to portray the strong religious beliefs of an early modern
such as [Blaise Pascal](Blaise_Pascal "Blaise Pascal"),
[Robert Boyle](Robert_Boyle "Robert Boyle"), or
[Isaac Newton](index.php?title=Isaac_Newton&action=edit&redlink=1 "Isaac Newton (page does not exist)")
as indicators of some sort of mental disorder.^[[2]](#note-1)^
