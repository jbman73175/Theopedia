Reinhold Niebuhr, 1963
**Reinhold Niebuhr** (1892–1971), born in Wright City, Missouri was
a major American theologian and political thinker of the
mid-twentieth century. A graduate of Yale Divinity School, Niebuhr
served as pastor of Bethel Evangelical Church in Detroit (1915–28),
where he became deeply interested in social problems. In 1928 he
began teaching at Union Theological Seminary, becoming professor of
applied Christianity in 1930; he remained in this post until his
retirement in 1960.

"In the early 1930s he shed his liberal Protestant hopes for the
church’s moral rule of society and became a political activist and
a Socialist. A prolific writer, he urged -- notably in
*Moral Man and Immoral Society* (1932),
*Christianity and Power Politics* (1940), and
*The Nature and Destiny of Man* (2 vol., 1941–43) -- clerical
interest in social reforms as well as the beliefs that men are
sinners, that society is ruled by self-interest, and that history
is characterized by irony, not progress.

"After World War II, he dropped much of his social radicalism and
preached 'conservative realism.' In his later works, such as
*Faith and History* (1949), Niebuhr argued for balances of
interests and defended Christianity as the world view that best
explains the heights and barbarisms of human behavior. In
*A Nation So Conceived* (1963) he analyzed aspects of the American
character. He also wrote *Man’s Nature and his Communities* (1965),
*Faith and Politics* (ed. by R. H. Stone 1968), and
*The Democratic Experience* (with P. E. Sigmund, 1969)." (from The
Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition)
