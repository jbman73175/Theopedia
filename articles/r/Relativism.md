"**Relativism** is the philosophical position that all points of
view are equally valid and that all truth is relative to the
individual." [[1]](http://www.carm.org/relativism.htm) In other
words, [truth](Truth "Truth") is what you want it to be. "Relative"
can essentially mean "wide ranging" or "not absolute". Thus, the
relative mindset believes that any idea of absolute truth
(something that is true irregardless of if someone thinks it is or
not) is impossible.

## Various kinds of truths

Within the topic of relativism there are two kinds of truth. First,
objective truth (synonymous with absolute truth) is a statement
that is true for everyone. For example, 2+2 will always equal four.
Even if someone thinks it is five, they are wrong. Secondly,
subjective truth is a statement that is based on one's own personal
view. Subjective can mean that it can be understood with different
meanings. The statement is thus *subjective* to each individual.

Relativism treats truth as if all truth is subjective. If one
person believes stealing is wrong, that belief is subjective (or
relative) to that individuals belief. Thus, it is "right" for them,
but should not be something another individual is forced to
believe.

## Various kinds of relativism

Relativism has been distinguished into different categories based
on what it is "relativizing". The most commonly encountered
category in Christian circles is *moral relativism*, the belief
that what is morally right for one person is not morally right for
another. This has been especially popular in the topic of "cultural
relativism" where cultures hold differing values.

## Implications for Christianity

The relativist worldview has profound effects on Christians. It
strikes at the heart of the claims of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"),
concluding that his statements are true for Christians, but not
true for them. Any view of morality is dismissed as a persons
personal beliefs, ones which are not to be shoved on any one else
who does not believe them to be true.

Other implications are found in that relativists reject the idea
that there is one way to God. One must accept all religions,
understanding them to be true according to what each person
believes to be true.

## Problems with relativism

At first glance, it appears very difficult to get around the
relativists conclusions. However, there is actually an internal
contradiction within their arguments. It can be understood as
follows:

-   Relativism denies there is any objective or absolute truth -
    something that is true for everyone
-   Yet, relativism is saying that it is "absolutely true" that
    there is no "absolute truth"

The contradiction is obvious, and claim also becomes hypocritical.
The denial of absolute truth cannot be considered "absolute
truth".
