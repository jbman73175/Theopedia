**Relevance** is "the quality of relating to a matter in hand with
pertinence and appropriateness" (Os Guinness,
*Prophetic Untimeliness*, p. 12).

"I think relevance is a crock. I don't think people care a whole
lot about what kind of music you have or how you shape the service.
They want a place where God is taken seriously, where they're taken
seriously, where there is no manipulation of their emotions or
their consumer needs. Why did we get captured by this advertising,
publicity mindset? I think it's destroying our church."
