**Quakerism** properly refers to
**The Religious Society of Friends**, whose members are commonly
known as Quakers. It was founded in England in the 17th century by
Christians who were dissatisfied with the existing denominations
and teaching of established churches. Historians generally credit
[George Fox](George_Fox "George Fox") (1624-1691) with being the
principal founder or most important early leader of this
organization.

The title *Friends* was adopted in 1652, the religious group being
previously called *Children of the Light* and
*Friends of the Truth*. The Puritan magistrate Gervase Bannett at
Derby first used the term *Quakers* in 1650 after witnessing the
trembling of Friends under religious fervour.
