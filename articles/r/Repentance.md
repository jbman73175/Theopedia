**Repentance**, also called **penitence**, is the
God-granted^[[1]](#note-0)^ attitude of having sorrow for personal
[sin](Sin "Sin") and the turning away from it towards a new life.

## Characteristics of true repentance

Biblical repentance consists of two mental assertions and
understandings, which if genuine, always manifest themselves in two
outward ways. These mental assertions also correspond to their
outward manifestations. If one has a true sense of guilt (A), that
will result in the outward hatred of sin (A'). If one has an
understanding of God's mercy in Christ (B), that will result in a
lifelong endeavor to be more like Christ (B').

**A** - a true sense of one's own guilt and sinfulness,
**B** - an understanding of God's mercy in Christ,
**A'** - results in an actual hatred of sin^[[2]](#note-1)^ and
turning from it to God,^[[3]](#note-2)^
**B'** - results in a persistent endeavor after a holy life in a
walking with God in the way of his commandments.
True repentance is characterized by a consciousness of guilt (Psalm
51:4, 9), of pollution (Psalm 51:5, 7, 10), and of helplessness
(Psalm 51:11; 109:21, 22). It sees the person in the moral
condition that God has always seen them. But repentance is not just
a sense of sin, but also an understanding of mercy, without which
there can be no true repentance (Psalms 51:1; 130:4).

## Biblical words for repentance

### Hebrew

**shûb**
^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#7725](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=7725&version=nas)]*^

This term is found over 1,000 times in the Old Testament, and in
the vast majority of its uses refers to a literal change of
direction. However, in more than 200 occurrences it refers to
Israel or God turning toward or away from one another. The modern
idea of repentance is found in turning away from
idolatry^[[4]](#note-3)^ and from cold-hearted
disobedience^[[5]](#note-4)^

**nâcham**
^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#5162](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=5162&version=nas)]*^

This term is found over 100 times in the Old Testament and means to
be sorry, or to pity or console oneself. In three of those
occurences it is referring to repentance.^[[6]](#note-5)^

### Greek

**metanoeō**
^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#3340](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=3340&version=nas)]*^

This term is the one most commonly translated in the New Testament
as "repentance" and literally means "to change one’s mind or
purpose, to repent." From this same root comes the noun metanoia:
"after-thought, repentance" (Liddell, 503). This is a reversal of
thinking. You see yourself differently: as fallen and
corrupt.^[[7]](#note-6)^

**metamelomī**
^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#3338](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=3338&version=nas)]*^

This term carries a more emotional implication and literally means
"to feel repentance, to rue, regret." In four of the five New
Testament occurrences, the [ESV](ESV "ESV") translates it as
"change(d) his/their mind(s)". From this same root comes the noun
metamelos: "repentance, regret" (Liddell, 503).^[[8]](#note-7)^

**epistrephō**
^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#1994](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Greek/grk.cgi?number=1994&version=nas)]*^

Although never translated as "repentance", this word furthers the
understanding of God's clear command for a change of mind, a
heartfelt sorrow for sin, and a turning from sin. It means "to turn
about, turn round; to return; to run towards; to correct, make to
repent; to turn oneself round, turn about; constantly turning"
(Liddell, 302). This is a change of the will. This is decidedly
turning from sin and the ways of sin to follow the ways of
Christ.^[[9]](#note-8)^

## Quotes

-   "Repentance is more than a change of mind or feeling sorry for
    one's sins. It is a radical and deliberate turning or returning to
    God that results in moral and ethical change and action” (Kenneth
    Barker, ed. *Zondervan NASB Study Bible*, Grand Rapids: Zondervan,
    1999. p. 1372).
-   "Repentance involves deliberate turning from sin to
    righteousness" (Barker, 1419).
-   "Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it,
    and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to
    Christ" ([Wayne Grudem](Wayne_Grudem "Wayne Grudem"),
    *Systematic Theology*, p. 713).
-   **Repentance unto life** is a saving grace, whereby a sinner,
    out of a true sense of his sin, and apprehension of the mercy of
    God in Christ, doth, with grief and hatred of his sin, turn from it
    unto God, with full purpose of, and endeavor after, new obedience.
    - *Westminster Shorter Catechism, Q.87*
-   "Yet it means not inward repentance only; nay, there is no
    inward repentance which does not outwardly work divers
    mortifications of the flesh." -- Point 3 on
    [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther")'s
    [95 Theses](95_Theses "95 Theses")
-   "He, who truly repents, is chiefly sorry for his *sins*. He,
    whose repentance is spurious, is chiefly concerned for their
    *consequences*. The former chiefly regrets that he has *done* evil;
    the latter that he has *incurred* evil. One sorely laments that he
    deserves punishment; the other that he must suffer punishment. One
    approves of the Law which condemns him; the other thinks he is
    hardly treated, and that the Law is rigorous. To the sincere
    penitent, sin appears exceeding sinful; to him who sorrows after a
    worldly sort, sin, in some form, appears pleasant. He regrets that
    it is forbidden. One says it is an evil and bitter thing to sin
    against God, even if no punishment followed. The other sees little
    evil in transgression if there were no painful consequences sure to
    follow." -- Dr. William S. Plumer (1802-1880),
    [Repentance and Conversion](http://www.apuritansmind.com/TULIP/PlumerWilliamRepentanceConversion.htm)
