**Reprobation**, in Christian theology, is a corollary to the
[Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") doctrine of
[unconditional election](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election")
which derives that since (in this view) some of mankind (the elect)
are predestined by God for salvation, the remainder are necessarily
pre-ordained to [condemnation](Hell "Hell"), i.e. reprobation. In
Calvinist terminology, the non-elect are often referred to as the
*reprobate*. Similarly, when a sinner is so hardened as to feel no
remorse or misgiving of conscience, it is considered as a sign of
reprobation.

The word "reprobation" comes from the Latin *reprobatus* (reproved
or condemned), which is the opposite of *approbatus* (commended or
approved).

## The Calvinist concept of the doctrine of reprobation

-   As stated in the
    [Canons of Dort](Canons_of_Dort "Canons of Dort"), First Head
    (Chapter 1) Article 15 [[1]](http://www.creeds.net/dordt/mp1.htm):

Moreover, Holy Scripture most especially highlights this eternal
and undeserved grace of our election and brings it out more clearly
for us, in that it further bears witness that not all people have
been chosen but that some have not been chosen or have been passed
by in God's eternal election-- those, that is, concerning whom God,
on the basis of his entirely free, most just, irreproachable, and
unchangeable good pleasure, made the following decision: to leave
them in the common misery into which, by their own fault, they have
plunged themselves; not to grant them saving faith and the grace of
conversion; but finally to condemn and eternally punish them
(having been left in their own ways and under his just judgment),
not only for their unbelief but also for all their other sins, in
order to display his justice. And this is the decision of
reprobation, which does not at all make God the author of sin (a
blasphemous thought!) but rather its fearful, irreproachable, just
judge and avenger.
-   As explained by
    [Loraine Boettner](Loraine_Boettner "Loraine Boettner") in
    *The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination* (Eerdmans, 1932):

The doctrine of absolute
[Predestination](Predestination "Predestination") of course
logically holds that some are foreordained to death as truly as
others are foreordained to life. The very terms “elect” and
“election” imply the terms “non-elect” and “reprobation.” When some
are chosen out others are left not chosen. The high privileges and
glorious destiny of the former are not shared with the latter.
This, too, is of God. We believe that from all eternity God has
intended to leave some of Adam’s posterity in their sins, and that
the decisive factor in the life of each is to be found only in
God’s will. As Mozley has said, the whole race after the fall was
“one mass of perdition,” and “it pleased God of His sovereign mercy
to rescue some and to leave others where they were; to raise some
to glory, giving them such grace as necessarily qualified them for
it, and abandon the rest, from whom He withheld such grace, to
eternal punishment.”
The chief difficulty with the doctrine of
[Election](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election") of
course arises in regard to the unsaved; and the Scriptures have
given us no extended explanation of their state. Since the mission
of Jesus in the world was to save the world rather than to judge
it, this side of the matter is less dwelt upon.
In all of the Reformed creeds in which the doctrine of Reprobation
is dealt with at all it is treated as an essential part of the
doctrine of Predestination. The
[Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession"),
after stating the doctrine of election, adds: “The rest of mankind,
God was pleased, according to the inscrutable counsel of His own
will, whereby He extendeth or withholdeth mercy as He pleaseth, for
the glory of His sovereign power over His creatures, to pass by,
and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin, to the
praise of His glorious justice.”

## Relation to double predestination

The term "double predestination" has been used to refer to the dual
concepts of election and reprobation in Reformed theology. This is
largely a pejorative term which leads to misconceptions of the
Calvinist (or Reformed) doctrine. See main discussion in
[Predestination](Predestination "Predestination").
