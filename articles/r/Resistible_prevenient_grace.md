---
**Resistible prevenient grace** is a doctrine concerning a type of
grace that offsets the noetic effects of the Fall, restores man's
free will, and thus enables every person to choose to come to
Christ or not. This view takes shape in two different forms,
reflecting the extent and way in which the grace is offered to
mankind. Historically, adherents of this doctrine say that this
grace is given to every person, thus *universal* prevenient grace.
Others have said that this grace is given *only* to those who
actually come under the intelligent hearing of the gospel, thus
*individualistic* prevenient grace.^[[1]](#note-0)^

The idea of *resistible* prevenient grace is an expression of
[Synergism](Synergism "Synergism").

## Universal prevenient grace

Historically, those who have held to a resistible prevenient grace
have stated that its extent is to every person, thus it is more
commonly known as Universal prevenient grace. This grace is
extended to every person, prior to and without reference to
anything they may have done. The extent of this grace also includes
those who have *not* heard the gospel.

This doctrine is embraced in
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"), especially those of the
Wesleyan tradition. [John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley")
typically referred to it in 18th century language as
*preventing grace*. In modern American vernacular, it is better
termed *preceding grace*. It is noted that the term *prevenient*
(or preceding) grace may also be found in
[Puritan](Puritan "Puritan") writings, but in this sense it is not
"universal" and is rather part of God's effectual call which
precedes [conversion](Conversion "Conversion").

Wesleyan [Thomas C. Oden](Thomas_C._Oden "Thomas C. Oden") of Drew
University defines universal prevenient grace as, "...the grace
that begins to **enable** one to choose further to cooperate with
saving grace. By offering the will the **restored** capacity to
respond to grace, the person then may freely and increasingly
become an active, willing **participant** in receiving the
conditions for justification."^[[2]](#note-1)^

Wesley and those of the Arminian tradition speak of their belief in
the doctrines of [original sin](Original_sin "Original sin") and
[total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity") thus appearing
consistent with the clear teaching of Scripture on those issues.
However, in their concept of universal prevenient grace, they make
man's resulting moral inability merely *hypothetical* and not
actual. According to this concept, God's "prevenient grace"
universally offsets the effects of the Fall and the extent of total
depravity such that every person on earth is "able" of his own free
will to turn to God in Christ for salvation.

### Scriptures cited in support

-   John 1:4: In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
-   John 3:16: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only
    Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have
    eternal life.
-   John 12:32: And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will
    draw all people to myself.
-   Romans 1:20: For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal
    power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since
    the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So
    they are without excuse.

From a [Reformed](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology")
perspective, if the Bible taught universal prevenient grace (i.e.
universal enablement) these verses would perhaps be consistent with
such an understanding. However, they do not teach universal
enablement in and of themselves. In fact, they may be understood
just as consistent with the Calvinist doctrine of universal
inability.

### The doctrine in Wesley

In John Wesley's sermon "On Working Out Our Own Salvation" (sermon
\#85), Wesley stated that *prevenient grace* elicits, "...the first
wish to please God, the first dawn of light concerning his will,
and the first slight transient conviction of having sinned against
him."

"I only assert, that there is a measure of free-will supernaturally
restored to every man, together with that supernatural light which
"enlightens every man that cometh into the world."^[[3]](#note-2)^

Wesley insisted on *prevenient grace* as a solution to two great
problems in Christianity: the reality of
[original sin](Original_sin "Original sin") and the Protestant
doctrine of salvation by grace alone. Wesley felt that
*prevenient grace* enabled the doctrines of original sin and
salvation by grace to co-exist while still maintaining God's
sovereignty and holy character as well as human freedom.

### Opposition to the doctrine

Calvinists refer to the Arminian (or Wesleyan) concept of
prevenient grace as "universal enablement". The Arminian view
teaches that God has *restored* to every individual the ability to
seek after God and choose salvation. Arminians also teach that God
seeks all people equally, and if it weren't for the fact that some
were willing to respond to his promptings and persuasions, no one
would be saved. Since this "prevenient" grace is supposedly given
to all alike, the determining factor in salvation becomes the will
of man. However, Biblically speaking , it is God's willingness and
resurrection-power alone that saves (Romans 9:18), as seen in the
doctrine of
*[irresistible grace](Irresistible_grace "Irresistible grace")*.

When the Bible speaks of humanity's condition of
[total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity"), of spiritual
death, it speaks of it as an actuality, not a
*hypothetical condition*, which the Wesleyan doctrine implies. When
the Bible says "no one seeks God, understands God, fears God, etc"
(such as in Romans 3:9-20), it is speaking about the real (present)
condition of the unregenerate. For example, when the Bible says
people are "dead in their transgressions" until God makes them
alive (Ephesians 2:1-5), this shows that people are incapable of
believing, because sin has destroyed their moral freedom, until God
gives them new life in Christ.

Arminians counter these objections by claiming that through
prevenient grace God has *initiated* salvation and that free will
has little to nothing to do with salvation. They acknowledge that
outside of Christ all men are under the dominion of sin (Rom. 6,
esp. vv 17-18, 22; 8:2; cf. John 8:34-36; et cetra) but argue that
God the Spirit is present among and is working to redeem "all" men
which they see as foretold by the prophets (Joel 2:28-29),
envisioned by Moses (Num. 11:29) and fulfilled on the Day of
Pentecost (Acts 2:16ff). Soteriologically speaking Wesleyans hold
that the moral choice that man makes is not to receive God the
Spirit because the Spirit of God is already there. Instead,
Wesleyans argue, the moral choice is to suppress God the Spirit,
doing that which is contrary to God's desire and His witness. In
this denial, if done unto death, means to die in ones' sins.
Therefore Wesleyans claim that receiving grace, positively
speaking, is passive, and negatively speaking, resisting grace is
active and it is not libertine freedom that is upheld in Wesleyan
theology but true compatibilism (God is sovereign, man is
responsible).

Evangelical Baptist theologian
[Millard Erickson](Millard_Erickson "Millard Erickson") says,

"It is here that many Arminians, recognizing human inability as
taught in the Scripture, introduce the concept of prevenient grace,
which is believed to have a universal effect nullifying the
[noetic results of sin](Noetic_effects_of_sin "Noetic effects of sin"),
thus making belief possible. The problem is that there is no clear
and adequate basis in Scripture for this concept of universal
enablement."^[[4]](#note-3)^
Similarly, Calvinist
[Thomas Schreiner](Thomas_Schreiner "Thomas Schreiner") maintains
that,

"Prevenient grace is attractive because it solves so many problems
[for the Arminian], but it should be rejected because it cannot be
exegetically vindicated."^[[5]](#note-4)^
According to these critics, its only function is to relieve the
believer's conscience of any doubt that God is doing everything he
reasonably can to rescue everyone.

God does show mercy to everyone, and this grace restrains sin and
gives mankind a knowledge of God and of their sinfulness and need
of rescue from sin. But this
*[common grace](Common_grace "Common grace")* is distinguished from
saving grace, which takes away willful blindness, converts the
stubborn heart, and effectively brings one to faith. *Common grace*
thus leaves people without excuse, but it does not save from sin
and it does not provide universal ability to savingly respond to
God.

## Individualistic prevenient grace

In contrast to *universal* prevenient grace, some have held to a
*individualistic* prevenient grace. The two views have all the same
features except that this view says that the extent to which this
grace is given is limited to only those who come under the
intelligent hearing of the gospel message. Those who support this
view often say that the gospel *inherently* has the power to enable
someone to believe when it is heard. This view should not be
confused with the Calvinistic view which says that drawing grace is
irresistibly given to the elect as they hear the gospel. In this
view, this resistible grace is given to *anyone* that hears the
gospel, whether they are chosen of God or not.

### Scriptures cited against it

-   1 Thess 1:4-5 — 4 For we know, brothers loved by God, that he
    has chosen you, 5 because our gospel came to you not only in word,
    but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction.
    ...
    -   Paul implies by saying the "gospel came ... not only in word"
        but in "full conviction" in this instance, that in other instances
        the gospel *could* come "only in word" rather than with "*full*
        conviction." Individualistic prevenient grace would seem to argue
        that everyone that hears the gospel is "convicted" to the same
        degree in every instance. Here, "full conviction" is mentioned as
        an evidence that the Thessalonians were chosen by God. They
        received some sort of grace that others who hear the gospel do not
        receive (they received "full," not "partial" conviction), but it is
        the same gospel nonetheless.
