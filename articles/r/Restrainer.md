Earlier in the chapter, Paul explained that the "man of
lawlessness" takes his seat in God's temple and proclaims himself
to be God.

## Identities

Opinions vary as to how this passage ties in with other passages of
eschatology, and the identity of the characters here.

[Dispensational](Dispensation "Dispensation")
[premillennialists](Premillennialist "Premillennialist") claim that
this is "the abomination that causes desolation" referred to in the
prophecies of Daniel (see
[Daniel 9:27](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel%209:27;&version=47;)),
and assert that the "lawless one" is the
[Antichrist](Antichrist "Antichrist").

The [Protestant](Protestant "Protestant")
[historicist](index.php?title=Historicist&action=edit&redlink=1 "Historicist (page does not exist)")
tradition claims that the "lawless one" is the Pope, exalting
himself in the [Church](Church "Church"), which is the
[temple](Temple "Temple") of God. For instance,
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"), in his commentary on 2
Thessalonians, puts forward this
idea.[[2]](http://www.ccel.org/c/calvin/comment3/comm_vol42/htm/vii.iv.htm)
[Ian Paisley](Ian_Paisley "Ian Paisley") is an example of a modern
Protestant who holds to this view. Calvin refers to the Restrainer
*via* the interpretation of
[St. John Chrysostom](St._John_Chrysostom "St. John Chrysostom"),
who suggsted either the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") or
the Roman Empire as the Restrainer, and following Chrysostom's
conclusion but not his reasoning, leant towards the Roman Empire as
the Restrainer.

Classical [amillennialists](Amillennialist "Amillennialist") agree
with the identification of the temple with the Church, but instead
would argue that the releasing of the man of lawlessness is
connected with the great apostasy, which is to occur just before
the return of Christ. The identity of the Restrainer is not
obvious, but could be the Holy Spirit or the preaching of the
gospel.^[[1]](#note-0)^
