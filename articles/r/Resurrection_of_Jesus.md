The **Resurrection of Jesus** is the miraculous act of God the
Father,^[[1]](#note-0)^ raising Jesus from the dead, confirming all
that Jesus said and did, demonstrating his power over life and
death. He raised [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") from
the dead on Sunday morning,^[[2]](#note-1)^ the third day (Luke
24:46) after pouring out his wrath on him upon the cross. The
resurrection is central to the gospel (1 Cor. 15:4), because if
Christ has not been raised, then Christian preaching and faith are
useless (1 Cor. 15:14) and Christians are still in their sins (1
Cor. 15:17). Paul also teaches that Christ's resurrection was
effective in the [justification](Justification "Justification") of
believers (Rom. 4:25).

## Defense of the resurrection

"And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain
and your faith is in vain." (1 Corinthians 15:14)

### Paul's defense in 1 Corinthians 15

The apostle Paul puts forward several arguments why the Corinthians
should believe the resurrection.

**Objective historical evidence**

-   The Scriptures predicted it (1 Cor. 15:4)
-   Jesus appeared bodily to a number of different people [others
    could verify] (1 Cor. 15:5-7)
-   Jesus appeared to Paul himself [he himself could verify] (1
    Cor. 15:8-11)

**Logical inconsistencies in the teaching of the Corinthians**

-   You teach that people do not raise from the dead. Christ rose.
    Therefore your teaching is wrong. (1 Cor. 15:12-13)
    -   Practically speaking, this means that there is no reason to
        preach Christ, and no reason to have faith in Christ because he
        cannot save. (1 Cor. 15:14)
    -   Theologically speaking, we sin against God by misrepresenting
        him, and we remain under the wrath of God. (1 Cor. 15:15-19)


### Bodily resurrection

Historic Protestant belief has been that Jesus Christ was
resurrected physically, "with the same body in which He suffered"
([Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")
8:4). This belief is vindicated by Christ's own words: "See my
hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a
spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have." (Luke
24:39)
