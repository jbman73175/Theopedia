The **resurrection of the body** is a fundamental belief that one
day all the spirits of people who have passed on from this earth
will be raised from the dead and reunited with their bodies. The
resurrection of the body is one of the most important and clearly
attested truths in all of Scripture, extending back to the days of
the patriarchs. The Bible teaches that there are two resurrections,
one unto life and one unto death, with judgment to follow each. The
doctrine of resurrection, therefore, rejects the possibility of
annihilationism (eternal unconsciousness).

## Attestation

### Old Testament

-   Job 19:25-26 - "For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the
    last he will stand upon the earth. And after my skin has been thus
    destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God..."
-   Abraham (Hebrews 11:19) - "...considered that God was able even
    to raise him from the dead."
-   David (Psalm 16:9-10) - "Therefore my heart is glad, and my
    whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure. For you will not
    abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption."
-   Isaiah 26:19 - "Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise.
    You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy! For your dew is
    a dew of light, and the earth will give birth to the dead."
-   Daniel 12:2 - "And many of those who sleep in the dust of the
    earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
    everlasting contempt."

### New Testament

-   Martha (John 11:24) - "I know that he will rise again in the
    resurrection on the last day."
-   Jesus (John 5:29) - "Do not marvel at this, for an hour is
    coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come
    out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and
    those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment."
-   Paul (Act 24:14-15) - "But this I confess to you, that
    according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of
    our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written
    in the Prophets, having a hope in God, which these men themselves
    accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the
    unjust."

## Significance

The fact of the resurrection is central to the Christian faith,
placed on equal footing with the death of Christ on the cross for
our sins. (1 Corinthians 15:3-4) Without a doctrine of physical
resurrection, the Bible is not a reliable record, those who wrote
it and follow it are deluded victims, and Jesus Christ is a
complete fraud. (1 Corinthians 15:12-19)

## Nature

### Connected to our mortal bodies

-   Compared to the relationship between seed and plant (1
    Corinthians 15:35-38) - Packer notes that this continuity "allows
    for great differences between the starting point and the end
    product." ^[[1]](#note-0)^
-   Different enough to be disguised, but similar enough to be
    recognized (John 20:14-29)

### Transformed to be fundamentally different

(1 Corinthians 15:42-44)

-   perishable » imperishable
-   weak » in power
-   dishonorable » in glory
-   natural » spiritual
