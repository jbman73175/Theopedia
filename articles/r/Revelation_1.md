Revelation is not a book of mysteries, but a revealing of the
univers' chief mystery - Jesus Christ Himself! Jesus was only
partially revealed in the Gospels. Here, He is fully revealed. On a
related note, the term, Apocalypse, often associated with
destruction and doom really comes from the word, Apocalypsis which
means "unveiling"
