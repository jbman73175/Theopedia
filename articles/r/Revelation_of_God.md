The term **revelation** deals with how [God](God "God") has
*revealed* himself to [humanity](Humanity "Humanity"), or in other
words, how he has made himself known. Theologians generally
distinguish God's revelation in two ways: General, and Special
revelation.

## General revelation

Also known as Universal revelation, general revelation deals with
how God can be understood through his creation. More specifically,
this can be manifest in physical nature, human nature, and history.
General revelation does not impart truths that are necessary for
salvation (e.g. sinfulness of humanity, the atonement, etc...),
however, it is argued that
[God's existence](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God "Arguments for the existence of God"),
[transcendence](Transcendence_of_God "Transcendence of God"),
[immanence](Immanence_of_God "Immanence of God"),
[self-sufficiency](Self-sufficiency_of_God "Self-sufficiency of God"),
[eternality](Eternality_of_God "Eternality of God"),
[power](Omnipotence_of_God "Omnipotence of God"),
[goodness](Attributes_of_God "Attributes of God"), and hate for
evil can be comprehended and seen through his creation (Elwell,
*Evangelical Dictionary of Theology*, p. 1,019; cf. Romans 1).

### Physical nature

The book of [Psalms](Psalms "Psalms") says that, "The heavens
declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his
handiwork" (Psalm 19:1). Paul quotes Psalm 19:4 in reference to
hearing the gospel, "But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they
have, for
*'Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world'*"
(Rom. 10:18). Later on in Psalm 97:6 it says that, "The heavens
proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory."
[Paul](Paul "Paul") told men that God had given testimony of
Himself in that he has shown kindness by giving them rain from
heaven, crops in their seasons and even provides them with their
food (Acts 14:15-17). A clearer passage states that, "What may be
known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to
them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities
- his eternal power and divine nature - have been clearly seen,
being understood from what has been made, so that men are without
excuse" (Rom. 1:19-20).

### Human nature

Because humans are made in
[God's image](Image_of_God "Image of God") (Genesis 1:27),
something about God can be learned from the study of human nature.
Most evident is the moral and spiritual qualities found within
humankind that reflect the character of God. Paul says that even
the law is written on the hearts of people who do not have the
specially revealed law (Romans 2:11-16).

### History

Some [theologians](Theologian "Theologian") note that history is
*His* - story. The [Bible](Bible "Bible") clearly indicates in
numerous places that God is moving the course of history and is
controlling the destinies of nations (Job 12:23; Psalm 47:7-8,
66:7; Isaiah 10:5-13; Daniel 2:21; Acts 17:26). It should then be
possible to sense God at work within history. A careful analysis of
the history of the nation of Israel should provide more evidence
than is needed.

## Special revelation

Special revelation is distinguished from general revelation in that
it is *direct* revelation from God. Examples include God's direct
speech to various people (e.g., prophets; cf. 2 Peter 1:20-21), the
[incarnation](Incarnation "Incarnation") (cf. Hebrews 1:1-2), and
the [Bible](Bible "Bible"). Such revelation is sufficient to
communicate the gospel, unlike general revelation, and thus
salvation is possible only through special revelation.

## The nature of revelation

The nature of revelation depends on whether revelation is given or
understood through experience, propositions ^[[1]](#note-0)^,
culture, scripture, or all four. Some theologians argue for one
option, while others argue that revelation is more holistic and
follows a both/and method in contrast to an either/or approach.
Thus, ones view of revelation will ultimately effect their view of
the Bible. [Postmodernists](Postmodernism "Postmodernism")
typically argue that the Bible is culture-bound and tend to reject
any propositional nature of revelation. Liberals, usually beginning
with
[Friedrich Schleiermacher](Friedrich_Schleiermacher "Friedrich Schleiermacher"),
also reject propositions yet are prone to emphasize personal
experience over other understandings of revelation. Lastly,
evangelical theologians such as
[Carl Henry](Carl_Henry "Carl Henry") and
[Charles Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge") preferred a more
propositional understanding. ^[[2]](#note-1)^ Since the 1980's,
[postliberals](Postliberals "Postliberals") have highlighted the
narrative nature of the Bible and thus emphasized revelation as
story in which disciples are to become part of that story as they
see and mold their lives into line with God's purposes.
Postliberals also tend to dismiss any propositional nature of the
Bible.

## Notes

1.  [↑](#ref-0) A proposition is a true or false statement made
    about reality.
2.  [↑](#ref-1) While they argued for a propositional understanding
    of the Bible, Hodge and Henry were also aware of its other forms
    such as promises, assertions, narratives, questions, proverbs,
    laws, parables, and covenants.
