Richard Bauckham
**Richard Bauckham** (b. September 22, 1946) is a
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") scholar and
professor of New Testament studies at St. Mary's College,
University of St. Andrews, Scotland. "Bauckham is perhaps best
known for his studies of the
[book of Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation") and
for his commentaries on [Jude](Epistle_of_Jude "Epistle of Jude")
and [2 Peter](2_Peter "2 Peter"). He is also a thoughtful
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian") who has written an
introduction to the theology of
[Jürgen Moltmann](Jürgen_Moltmann "Jürgen Moltmann"). In his book
*God Crucified* (1999), Bauckham displays the craft of both a
careful exegete and a deft theologian as he explores the riddle of
how the radically [monotheistic](Monotheism "Monotheism") Jews who
composed the earliest church could have come to call Jesus
'Lord'."^[[1]](#note-0)^ His book *Jesus and the Eyewitnesses* won
the 2007 Book Award in Biblical Studies from
*[Christianity Today](Christianity_Today "Christianity Today")*.
