Richard Baxter
**Richard Baxter** (1615-1691), one of the great English pastors
and [theologians](Theologian "Theologian"). Though without a
university education, and always sickly, he acquired great
learning. In 1633 he had a brief experience of court life at
Whitehall (London), but turned from the court in disgust and
studied theology. In 1638 he was ordained by the bishop of
Worcester and preached in various places till 1641, when he began
his ministry at Kidderminster (18 m. s.w. of Birmingham), as
"teacher." There he labored with wonderful success so that the
place was utterly transformed. When the Civil War broke out (1642)
he retired temporarily to Gloucester and then to Coventry because
he sided with the parliament, while all in and about Kidderminster
sided with the king. He was, however, no blind partizan and boldly
spoke out for moderation and fairness. After acting as an army
chaplain he separated from the army, partly on account of illness,
and returned to Kidderminster.

## In London

In the spring of 1660 he left Kidderminster and went to London. He
preached before the House of Commons at St. Margaret's,
Westminster, Apr. 30, 1660, and before the lord mayor and aldermen
at St. Paul's, May 10, and was among those to give Charles II
welcome to his kingdom. Charles made him one of his chaplains and
offered him the bishopric of Hereford, which he declined. He was a
leader on the Non-conformist side in the
[Savoy Conference](Savoy_Conference "Savoy Conference") (1661) and
presented a revision of the Prayer-book which could be used by the
Non-conformists. He also preached frequently in different pulpits.
Seeing how things were going, he desired permission to return to
Kidderminster as curate, but was refused. On May 16, 1662, three
days before the Act of Uniformity was passed, he took formal
farewell of the Church of England and retired to Acton, a west
suburb of London. From this time on he had no regular charge and
until the accession of William and Mary in 1688 he suffered, like
other Non-conformist preachers, from repressive laws often
rigorously and harshly enforced.

## Imprisonment

During all these years on the verge of trouble because he persisted
in preaching, he was actually imprisoned only twice, once for a
short period, and again from Feb. 28, 1685, to Nov. 24, 1686. The
judge who condemned him the second time was George Jeffreys, who
treated him with characteristic brutality. The charge was that in
his Paraphrase of the New Testament (1685) Baxter had libeled the
Church of England. But insult, heavy and indeed ruinous fines,
enforced wanderings, anxiety as to personal safety, and
imprisonment had no power to daunt Baxter's spirit. He preached
constantly to great multitudes, and addressed through his writings
a still vaster throng. The Toleration Act of 1688 ended his
sufferings and he died in peace.

## Writings

Baxter was one of the most voluminous of English authors, and
regarded by many as one of the best. But there is no complete
edition of his 108 treatises, only of his practical works. He is
most known as the author of *The Reformed Pastor* (1656), a
treatise on pastoral theology still usable;
*A Call to the Unconverted to turn and live and accept of mercy while mercy may be had, as even they would find mercy in the day of their extremity; from the Living God*
(1657), uttered as a dying man to dying men and impressive to-day;
but chiefly because of *The Saints' Everlasting Rest*: or a
treatise of the blessed state of the Saints in their enjoyment of
God in glory. Wherein is shown its excellency and certainty; the
misery of those that lose it, the way to attain it, and assurance
of it; and how to live in the continual delightful foretaste of it,
by the help of meditation. Written by the author for his own use,
in the time of his languishing, when God took him off from all
public employment; and afterwards preached in his weekly lecture
(1650). The "Saints' Rest" gained a reputation it has never lost,
but the 648 pages of the original edition have proved too many for
posterity and the work is read nowadays, if at all, only in an
abridgment of an abridgment. The best brief characterization of
this faithful, fearless, and gifted religious teacher is on his
monument at Kidderminster, erected by Churchmen and
Non-conformists, and unveiled July 28, 1875: "Between the years
1641 and 1660 this town was the scene of the labours of Richard
Baxter, renowned equally for his Christian learning and his
pastoral fidelity. In a stormy and divided age he advocated unity
and comprehension, pointing the way to everlasting rest." In many
respects Baxter was a modern man.

## Theology

Richard Baxter held to a form of
[Amyraldism](Amyraldism "Amyraldism"), a less rigorous more
moderate form of [Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") which rejected
the idea of a
[limited atonement](Limited_atonement "Limited atonement") in favor
of a
[universal atonement](Universal_atonement "Universal atonement")
similar to that of the Arminians. He devised an eclectic middle
route between Reformed, Arminian, and Roman doctrines of grace:
interpreting the kingdom of God in terms of contemporary political
ideas, he explained Christ’s death as an act of universal
redemption (penal and vicarious, but not substitutionary), in
virtue of which God has made a "new law" offering pardon and
amnesty to the penitent. [Repentance](Repentance "Repentance") and
[faith](Faith "Faith"), being obedience to this law, are the
believer’s personal saving righteousness. This particular doctrine
is called [neonomianism](Neonomianism "Neonomianism") and is
sometimes referred to as "Baxterianism."^[[1]](#note-0)^
