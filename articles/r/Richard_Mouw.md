## Education and Career

Mouw was educated at Houghton College from which he received the
B.A. degree. He then studied for the M.Div degree at Western
Theological Seminary. He was awarded the M.A. from the University
of Alberta, and his PhD. degree from the University of Chicago.

Mouw was Professor of Christian philosophy at Calvin College for
seventeen years. He has also served as a visiting professor to the
Free University of Amsterdam. He was appointed Professor of
Christian Philosophy and Ethics at Fuller Theological Seminary in
1985. In 1993 he was elected president of Fuller Theological
Seminary.

During the 1970s Mouw was noted as an innovative evangelical
thinker and activist at Calvin College alongside of Stephen Monsma
and Paul Henry. Mouw was identified by political scientist Robert
Booth Fowler as being one of the important voices in what Fowler
dubbed "reform-oriented evangelicals". For example Mouw was among
several evangelicals involved in the 1973 Conference of
Evangelicals for Social Concern, and was a signatory to that
conference's declaratory statement "An Historic Moment for Biblical
Social Concern". Mouw's concerns for social justice issues is
reflected in his membership in various organizations such as the
International Justice Mission, International Center for Religion
and Diplomacy, and Christians for Biblical Equality.

He has written extensively on Christian social justice matters, as
well as on philosophical topics. He has been a keen advocate of
interpreting contemporary culture and suggesting fresh avenues for
Christian engagement with culture. He has also urged evangelicals
to have a deeper appreciation of their own heritage, particularly
in their hymnology and fundamentalist values.

In 2000 he delivered the Stoeb Lectures in which he reanalysed the
theological concept of [common grace](Common_grace "Common grace").
This topic has had a history of debate within Protestant circles
generally, and among [Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") and
[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") theologians. Mouw's lectures
generated a written response from the conservative Calvinist David
Engelsma, and they have also held a public debate with each other
over the subject.

## Controversies

Mouw has also been noted for his advocacy of a change of attitude
and tactics among [evangelicals](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism")
when encountering devotees of new religious movements. This is
reflected in the foreword he composed to the apologetics text
*The New Mormon Challenge* where he applauded the authors for their
efforts to respond to [Mormons](Mormonism "Mormonism") at a level
of intellectual cogency, by using lofty standards of scholarship
and maintaining ethical integrity in their unswerving commitment to
orthodoxy. Similarly, he endorsed the literary debate between Craig
Blomberg (evangelical New Testament scholar) and Stephen Robinson
(a Mormon scholar) in the book *How Wide the Divide?* (InterVarsity
Press, 1997). He has also endorsed the broader cross-cultural
missions position presented by various American, Canadian and
Australian evangelicals in the book
*Encountering New Religious Movements* (Kregel 2004).

Mouw's stance on dialogue with scholars and leaders of the Mormons
([Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"))
has generated some controversy among Christian apologists in the
Christian countercult movement. In November 2004 he offered an
apology to Mormons for the way in which many evangelicals have
treated the Mormon faith in countercult books. He made this apology
in introductory remarks at a speaking event where the Christian
evangelist [Ravi Zacharias](Ravi_Zacharias "Ravi Zacharias") was
the featured speaker in Temple Square, Salt Lake City. He has also
been the object of criticism from some countercult apologists for
his back cover remarks on a book written by the Mormon scholar
Robert Millet that was published by William B. Eerdmans.
