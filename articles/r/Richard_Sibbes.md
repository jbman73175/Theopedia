**Richard Sibbes** (1577-1635) a [Puritan](Puritan "Puritan")
cleric and divine, "was born in Tostock, Suffolk, the first-born
son of a wheelwright. In 1595, against his father's wishes that he
carry on the family trade, Sibbes joined St John's College,
Cambridge. Though of his own spiritual progress we know little, we
do know that he undoubtedly heard the preaching of William Perkins
in Cambridge, and that he was ultimately converted under the
ministry of Perkins' successor,
[Paul Baynes](Paul_Baynes "Paul Baynes").

"After earning his B.D. in 1610, he was appointed as a lecturer at
Holy Trinity in Cambridge, a position from which he was relieved
five years later because of his Puritan tendencies. Sibbes,
however, had by then become widely known for his preaching, and
through the influence of some powerful friends, in 1617 he was
chosen to be the preacher at Gray's Inn, one of the most
influential pulpits in London. At Gray's Inn, Sibbes' eminence and
influence as a preacher continued to grow, to the extent that his
foes did not dare move against him."

[Note: Though the above paragraph represents the majority view,
Sibbes was actually *not* removed from either his lectureship at
Holy Trinity or his fellowship at St. John's College because of his
Puritan tendencies. Documentary evidence demonstrates that he
simply wasn't removed from those posts at all, as has been widely
believed. (See Mark E. Dever, "Moderation and Deprivation: A
Reappraisal of Richard Sibbes" in
*Journal of Ecclesiastical History*, 43:3 (July, 1992) 396-413.)]

"In 1626, he came back to Cambridge as Master of St Catherine's
Hall, while retaining his position at Gray's Inn. And in 1633, he
returned to Holy Trinity, this time by crown appointment "to its
perpetual curacy." Sibbes continued his preaching ministry both
there and at Gray's Inn, as well as maintaining his duties at St
Catherine's. until his death on 5th July 1635, at the age of 58.

"During his lifetime, Sibbes authorised the publishing of only
three volumes of his work. One is a treatise entitled
*The Soul's Conflict with Itself and Victory over itself by Faith*,
and the other two are collections of sermons under the titles
*The Saint's Safety in Evil Times* and
*The Bruised Reed and Smoking Flax*. Both *The Soul's Conflict* and
*The Saint's Safety* are able works, exposing their author as a
master at the practical application of Scripture and theology. But
it is in *The Bruised Reed* that we find crystallised the
foundation and essence of Sibbes' own ministry and preaching."
