**Richard Swinburne** is a Christian philosopher and currently
teaches at Oxford. His contribution to Christian philosophy has
been immense. Swinburne studied at the University of Oxford, and
spent around a decade each lecturing at the University of Hull and
the University of Keele, before returning to Oxford to become
Nolloth Professor of the Philosophy of the Christian Religion from
1985 to his retirement in 2002. During this time he produced a
series of influential works, without doubt changing the face of the
[philosophy of religion](Philosophy_of_religion "Philosophy of religion").

His first three books—*The Coherence of Theism*,
*The Existence of God*, and *Faith and Reason* —comprised a
trilogy. The first installment argued for the possibility of
[God’s existence](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God "Arguments for the existence of God"),
the second for the probability of God’s existence, and the third
applied this to the matter of religious faith. The pivotal second
work he later reworked into the rather more accessible
*Is There a God?*

Swinburne’s other works include a tetralogy on philosophical
theology, consisting of *Responsibility and Atonement*,
*Revelation*, *The Christian God*, and
*Providence and the Problem of Evil*, and a study of the mind-body
problem, *The Evolution of the Soul*. He has also worked outside
the philosophy of religion, writing *Personal Identity*, and
*Epistemic Justification*. More recently, in his
*The Resurrection of God Incarnate*, he used Bayes’ theorem to
argue that the historicity of Jesus’ resurrection can be
established with 97% certainty.
