**Richard Watson** (1781-1833) was a British
[Methodist](Methodism "Methodism") theologian who was one of the
most important figures in 19th century Methodism.

Watson was born in Lincolnshire and entered the Methodist
itinerancy in 1796, serving as President of Conference in Britain
in 1826 and as secretary to the Wesleyan Missionary Society from
1821 to 1825. In Britain, he was a leading opponent of slavery.

Watson was a gifted writer and theologian. In 1818 he wrote a reply
to [Adam Clarke's](Adam_Clarke "Adam Clarke") refutation of the
doctrine of the
[eternal Sonship of Christ](Eternal_Sonship_of_Christ "Eternal Sonship of Christ");
Watson believed that Clarke's views were unorthodox and, therefore,
not faithfully Wesleyan.

In 1823 he began to publish his *Theological Institutes*, which
remained a standard for many years. It was the first attempt to
systematize John Wesley's theology and by extension Methodist
doctrine. In 1831 wrote a well-regarded life of John Wesley.
