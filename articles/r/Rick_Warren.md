## Quotes

"Around this time", Warren says he was driven to reexamine
Scripture with 'new eyes.' What he found humbled him. "I found
those 2,000 verses on the poor. How did I miss that? I went to
Bible college, two seminaries, and I got a doctorate. How did I
miss God's compassion for the poor? I was not seeing all the
purposes of God. The church is the body of Christ. The hands and
feet have been amputated and we're just a big mouth, known more for
what we're against." Warren found himself praying, "God, would you
use me to reattach the hands and the feet to the body of Christ, so
that the whole church cares about the whole gospel in a whole new
way-through the local
church?"[[1]](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/010/17.32.html)

## Those who are skeptical

Despite having a best-selling book and 15,000 members of his
church, Warren has received criticism both against his theology and
his church methods. Some have expressed mere disagreement, while
others have taken a more extreme approach as to come close to
calling Warren a [heretic](Heretic "Heretic"). The following quote
illustrates this point,

"Critics of *The Purpose Driven Life* have already pointed out
Warren’s tendency to promote the teachings of Catholic mystics like
Henri Nouwen and John of the Cross, his mixing of New Age
techniques with Bible-based prayer and meditation, and his use of
Jungian occult-based psychology to identify a Christian’s
personality and spiritual gifts. But our primary concern . . .
[should be] focused on how Warren has wrested the Scriptures to
lend biblical credence to his misguided teachings."
