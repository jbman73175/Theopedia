The term **righteousness** is employed both in the
[Old](Old_Testament "Old Testament") and
[New Testaments](New_Testament "New Testament"). The
[Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew") word generally used is *sedekah*, and the
[Greek](Greek "Greek") term is typically *dikaiosoune*. Both are
connoted as a kind of moral attribute and quality while not
diminishing the term's legal nature and status.


## Righteousness in the OT

Righteousness in the Old Testament is most often employed in books
such as [Psalms](Psalms "Psalms") and
[Isaiah](Book_of_Isaiah "Book of Isaiah"), and is often attributed
as a moral quality or pertaining to moral behavior (e.g., Psalm
18:24; Isaiah 56:1). One's righteousness is due to the fact that
they have lived uprightly and behaved justly before God and their
neighbor. The righteous ones are those who show mercy and walk in
the counsel of the Lord (see Psalm 1; Isaiah 57:1-2).
