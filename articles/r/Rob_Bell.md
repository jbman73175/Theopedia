## Biographical information

Bell is the son of U.S. District Court Judge Robert Holmes Bell,
and played guitar in a variety of bands from high school through
his time in seminary. He earned a bachelor's degree in Psychology
in 1992 from [Wheaton College](Wheaton_College "Wheaton College"),
and also graduated from
[Fuller Theological Seminary](Fuller_Theological_Seminary "Fuller Theological Seminary")
before moving to Grand Rapids and founding Mars Hill Bible Church
in 1999. Bell named the church after the location in Greece,
mentioned in [Acts](Acts "Acts") 17. Bell is featured in a short
series of direct-to-DVD devotional films called NOOMA, from the
phonetic spelling of the Greek word *pneuma*, which means *wind* or
*spirit*. He also has two tour dvds ("Everything Is Spiritual" and
"The Gods Arent Angry") and has conducted a third one named after
his second book "Sex God".

## Quotes from his book *Velvet Elvis*

###Inspiration and Hermeneutics

-   "The Bible is a collection of stories that teach us about what
    it looks like when God is at work through actual people. The Bible
    has the authority it does only because it contains stories about
    people interacting with the God who has all authority." - p. 65

###Sola Scriptura

-   "...it wasn't until the 300s that what we know as the sixty-six
    books of the Bible were actually agreed upon as the 'Bible'. This
    is part of the problem with continually insisting that one of the
    absolutes of the Christian faith must be a belief that "Scripture
    alone" is our guide. It sounds nice, but it is not true. In
    reaction to abuses by the church, a group of believers during a
    time called the Reformation claimed that we only need the authority
    of the Bible. But the problem is that we got the Bible from the
    church voting on what the Bible even is. So when I affirm the Bible
    as God's word, in the same breath I have to affirm that when those
    people voted, God was somehow present, guiding them to do what they
    did. When people say that all we need is the Bible, it is simply
    not true. In affirming the Bible as inspired, I also have to affirm
    the Spirit who I believe was inspiring those people to choose those
    books." - p. 68

###Heaven and Hell

-   "Heaven is full of forgiven people. Hell is full of forgiven
    people. Heaven is full of people God loves, whom Jesus died for.
    Hell is full of forgiven people God loves, whom Jesus died for. The
    difference is how we choose to live, which story we choose to live
    in, which version of reality we trust. Ours or God's." - p. 146

-   "When people use the word hell, what do they mean? They mean a
    place, an event, a situation absent of how God desires things to
    be. Famine, debt, oppression, loneliness, despair, death,
    slaughter--they are all hell on earth. Jesus' desire for his
    followers is that they live in such a way that they bring heaven to
    earth. What's disturbing is when people talk more about hell after
    this life than they do about Hell here and now. As a Christian, I
    want to do what I can to resist hell coming to earth." - p. 148

-   "The goal of Jesus isn't to get into heaven. The goal is to get
    heaven here." - p. 148

###The Fall

-   "I can't find one place in the teachings of Jesus, or the Bible
    for that matter, where we are to identify ourselves first and
    foremost as sinners. Now this doesn't mean we don't sin; that's
    obvious. In the book of James it's written like this: 'We all
    stumble in many ways.' Once again, the greatest truth of the story
    of Adam and Eve isn't that it happened, but that it happens. We all
    make choices to live outside of how God created us to live. We have
    all come up short." - p. 139

###Ultimate Reality

-   "For a Christian, Jesus' teachings aren't to be followed
    because they are a nice way to live a moral life. They are to be
    followed because they are the possible insight into how the world
    really works. They teach us how things are. I don't follow Jesus
    because I think Christianity is the best religion. I follow Jesus
    because he leads me into ultimate reality. He teaches me to live in
    tune with how reality is. When Jesus said, 'No one comes to the
    Father except through me', he was saying that his way, his words,
    his life is our connection to how things truly are at the deepest
    levels of existence. For Jesus then, the point of religion is to
    help us connect with ultimate reality, God." - p. 83

## Criticism of doctrinal method

"According to Mr. Bell there are two ways to approach doctrine: as
a brick or a spring. The brick approach to doctrine is solid,
unmoving and unchanging. It has no life. It is the wrong approach.
A spring has life; it is flexible, and it is constantly changing.
Rob Bell believes all doctrines are springs. By embracing such a
view of doctrine and truth Mr. Bell drives a wedge between reality
and doctrinal truth. He creates a paradox where there isn't one.
Bell views doctrines as 'statements about our faith that help give
words to the depth that we are experiencing.'" ^[[2]](#note-1)^
