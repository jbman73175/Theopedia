**Robert Aitken** (1734-1802) was a Philadelphia printer and the
first to publish a [Bible](Bible "Bible") in the newly formed
United States. The war with Britain cut off the supply of Bibles to
the United States with the result that on September 11, 1777, the
Continental Congress instructed its Committee of Commerce to import
20,000 Bibles from "Scotland, Holland or elsewhere." On January 21,
1781, Aitken petitioned Congress to officially sanction a
publication of the Old and New Testaments (the King James Version)
which he was preparing at his own expense. Whereupon it was
resolved that the members of Congress "highly approve the pious and
laudable undertaking of Mr. Aitken, as subservient to the interest
of religion ... in this country, and ... they recommend this
edition of the bible to the inhabitants of the United States." This
resolution was a result of Aitken's successful accomplishment of
his project.
