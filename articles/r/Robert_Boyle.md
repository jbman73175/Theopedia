Robert Boyle (Jan 25, 1627—Dec 30, 1691) is remembered as one of
the great early modern scientists. Boyle's law states that for a
given amount of gas, the product of its volume and pressure remains
constant. To Boyle, this law had only a minor function in one of
his least important works. Largely overlooked is Boyle's role as
one of the "eminent apologists of the Christian
religion."^[[1]](#note-Hooykaas1)^ Compared to Boyle's all but
forgotten 17th century efforts in Christian apologetics, such
efforts in the 18th and 19th century—common in and to current
debates—are scientifically naive, weak, and
timid^[[1]](#note-Hooykaas1)^. One of the great ironies of history
is that Boyle's apologetical inventions of a mechanical philosophy
and a clock-work universe as expressions of God's sovereignty were
intended to show humility before God's Works in the same way that
Christians show humility before God's Word^[[1]](#note-Hooykaas1)^.
But these Christian apologetic metaphors of early modern science
were later usurped by 18th century diests in order to turn them
back upon and attack Christianity itself.^[[2]](#note-0)^
