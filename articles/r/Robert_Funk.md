**Robert W. Funk** (July 18, 1926 - September 3, 2005), was founder
of the controversial [Jesus Seminar](Jesus_Seminar "Jesus Seminar")
and the nonprofit Westar Institute in Santa Rosa, California.

Funk, an academic, sought to promote research and education on what
he called biblical literacy. His approach was historical and
critical, with a strongly sceptical view of traditional Christian
belief, particularly about the
[historical Jesus](Historical_Jesus "Historical Jesus").

Funk has a bachelor of divinity and masters degree from Butler
University and its affiliated Christian Theological Seminary in
1950 and 1951, a PhD in 1953 from Vanderbilt University and was a
Guggenheim Fellow and a Senior Fulbright Scholar.

He taught at the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem,
was chairman of the graduate department of religion at Vanderbilt
University and executive secretary of the Society of Biblical
Literature.

By the time Funk launched the Jesus Seminar, scholarly work on the
"search for the historical Jesus" had been underway for many years.
See for example
*The Quest of the Historical Jesus: A Critical Study of Its Progress from Reimarus to Wrede*,
by [Albert Schweitzer](Albert_Schweitzer "Albert Schweitzer") in
1906.
