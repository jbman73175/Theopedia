**Robert Horton Gundry** is an American
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") scholar and Westmont
College's Scholar-in-Residence. He received his Ph.D. from
[Manchester University](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Attended_university::w:Manchester_University&action=edit&redlink=1 "Attended university::w:Manchester University (page does not exist)")
in 1961 and taught for several decades at
[Taught at::Westmont College](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Taught_at::Westmont_College&action=edit&redlink=1 "Taught at::Westmont College (page does not exist)")
in California.

In 1973 Gundry published
*The Church and the Tribulation: A Biblical Examination of Posttribulationism.*
This outstanding piece of scholarship still stands as one of the
best works on the End Times and the return of Christ. In 1977 he
followed up with another book addressing the controversy regarding
the timing of the Second Coming when he published
*First the Antichrist: Why Christ Won't Come Before The Antichrist Does.*

In 1982 he published
*Matthew: A Commentary on His Literary and Theological Art*
analyzing the
[Gospel of Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew"). Gundry
used [redaction criticism](Biblical_criticism "Biblical criticism")
in his work. He thus argued that Matthew adapted the story of Jesus
to appeal to the intended audience. Especially problematic was
Gundry's assertion that Matthew made historical additions to the
infancy story in [Matthew 1](Matthew_1 "Matthew 1") and
[2](Matthew_2 "Matthew 2").

This sparked a major of controversy in the
[ETS](http://www.theopedia.com/index.php?title=Former_member_of::Evangelical_Theological_Society&action=edit&redlink=1 "Former member of::Evangelical Theological Society (page does not exist)").
Gundry contended his work did not question the inerrancy of
Matthew. Rather he argued that the Bible was never meant to be a
work of history and that the religious content contains no errors.
Gundry's view was supported by a significant portion of the ETS.
The Society's executive looked into the matter and at first cleared
Gundry. However a campaign against Gundry was launched, spearheaded
by [Norman Geisler](Norman_Geisler "Norman Geisler"). This campaign
succeeded and in December 1983 Gundry was expelled from the ETS.
