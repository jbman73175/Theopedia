Robert Murray McCheyne
**Robert Murray McCheyne** (1813 - 1843), was a Scottish pastor and
theologian. He studied at the University of Edinburgh where he
distinguished himself by his poetical talent. In 1831 he took up
the study of theology at the Divinity Hall of the university under
Thomas Chalmers and David Welsh, and on November 7, 1835, he began
his ministerial labors at Larbert, near Falkirk, as assistant to
John Bonar. In 1836 he was ordained to the pastorate of St. Peter's
Church, Dundee, which he held till his death.

In 1839 he was a member of the committee sent to Palestine by the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland to collect information
respecting the Jews. On his return he entered upon a successful
evangelistic campaign, first at Dundee, then at other places in
Scotland and northern England. In the controversy that finally led
to the disruption of the Scottish Church he took very decided
ground on the non-intrusion side. McCheyne was a fine example of
the true Gospel preacher. Long after his death he was constantly
referred to as " the saintly McCheyne."
