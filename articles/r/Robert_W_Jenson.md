Robert W. Jenson
**Robert W. Jenson** is an American [Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran")
[systematic theologian](Systematic_theology "Systematic theology")
and Professor Emeritus of Religion at St. Olaf College in
Northfield, MN. Currently he is a professor of religion at the
Center for Theological Inquiry at Princeton Theological Seminary.

Jenson attended Luther College and Luther Seminary. Between his
years as a college student and a seminarian, he studied
[philosophy](Philosophy "Philosophy") in Paris as a Fulbright
scholar. At Luther Seminary Jenson was assistant to the famous
Orthodox Lutheran theologian, Herman Preus. Preus infused with
Jenson a strong belief in Orthodox Lutheran understanding of
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination"). Against the
majority of the staff at Luther Seminary at that time, who believed
that [God](God "God") merely
[foreknew](Foreknowledge_of_God "Foreknowledge of God") who would
have faith and who not, Preus held that God had decreed the
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") of a definite number of the
elect, without a decree of
[reprobation](Reprobation "Reprobation").

Later Jenson went to Heidelberg where he became familiar with the
theology of [Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth"), and, under the
supervision of Peter Brunner, he wrote his doctoral dissertation on
Barth's [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of
[election](Election "Election"). Jenson then began teaching at
Luther College, where he continued to study Barth and also became
increasingly interested in the philosophy of Hegel. The staff of
the Religion Department at Luther College grew impatient with his
teaching and charged him with teaching [heresy](Heresy "Heresy").
They threatened to resign if Jenson was not fired, but the
college's president supported Jenson, and several professors
subsequently left the college.

Throughout this period he became increasingly interested in
ecumenical theology, and in the 1980s and 1990s his theology moved
in a progressively Catholic and ecumenical direction. With Braaten
he founded the
[Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology](http://www.e-ccet.org/).
The Centre publishes the journal *Pro Ecclesia*, and it has
produced several books on ecumenical theology.

## Trinitarian theology

"Jenson argues that the phrase 'Father, Son, and Holy Spirit' is a
proper name for the God whom Christians know in and through Jesus
Christ. It is imperative, he argues, that God should have a proper
name. Trinitarian discourse is Christianity's effort to identify
God... Jenson points out that ancient Israel existed and thought
within a polytheistic context, in which the term 'god' conveyed
relatively little information. It was necessary to
*name and identify* the god in question. A similar situation was
confronted by the writers of the New Testament, who were obliged to
identify the god at the heart of their faith, and distinguish this
god from the many other gods worshiped and acknowledged in the
region, especially Asia Minor. The doctrine of the Trinity thus
*identifies* and *names* the Christian God - but identifies and
names this God in a manner consistent with the biblical witness. It
is not a name which we have chosen; it is a name which has been
chosen for us, and which we are authorized to use. In this way,
Jenson defends the priority of God's self-revelation against human
constructions of concepts of divinity." ^[[1]](#note-0)^
