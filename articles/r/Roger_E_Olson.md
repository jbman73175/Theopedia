Roger E. Olson
**Roger E. Olson** (b. 1952) is an
[evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical") Arminian and professor of
[theology](Theology "Theology") at George W. Truett Theological
Seminary, Baylor University. He has been on the faculty since 1999
and specializes in
[historical theology](Historical_theology "Historical theology").
Olson's theological perspective is considered "postconservative",
similar to the thought of
[Stanley Grenz](Stanley_Grenz "Stanley Grenz"), yet defined
differently than the postconservativism of other scholars such as
[Kevin Vanhoozer](Kevin_Vanhoozer "Kevin Vanhoozer"). His recent
work entitled *Arminian Theology: Myths And Realities* defends his
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism") against charges of
[Semi-Pelagianism](Semi-Pelagianism "Semi-Pelagianism") while
admitting it is [synergistic](Synergism "Synergism") in its view of
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation").
