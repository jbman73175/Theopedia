The **Roman Catholic Church** is the largest branch of Christianity
and the world's largest religious organization. It is headquartered
in Vatican City, which is contained in the city of Rome, and is led
by the [Bishop](Bishop "Bishop") of Rome, called the
[Pope](Papacy "Papacy"), in an
[episcopal](Episcopal_(polity) "Episcopal (polity)") form of church
government.

The Roman Catholic Church shares many basic tenets with evangelical
Protestants such as: the doctrine of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"), the
[inspiration of the Bible](Inspiration_of_the_Bible "Inspiration of the Bible"),
the [deity of Christ](Deity_of_Christ "Deity of Christ"), and His
[virgin birth](Virgin_birth_of_Jesus "Virgin birth of Jesus"),
[atoning death](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ") and
[bodily resurrection](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus").
However, there are many other tenets in which the Catholic Church
differs from other Christians, many of which became historically
relevant during the [Reformation](Reformation "Reformation"). Most
significant are:

-   its understanding of justification, which denies the Protestant
    doctrine of [justification](Justification "Justification") through
    [faith alone](Faith_alone "Faith alone") by
    [grace alone](Grace_alone "Grace alone")
-   its understanding of the relationship between Tradition and
    Scripture which denies the Protestant doctrine that
    [Scripture](Scripture_alone "Scripture alone") takes precedence
    over church teaching and tradition.
-   its mediatorial [priesthood](Sacerdotalism "Sacerdotalism") and
    the theology of its [Mass](Mass "Mass").
-   its beliefs surrounding [Mary](Mary "Mary") and the
    [saints](Saint "Saint").

## Brief Overview

The Roman Catholic Church claims direct apostolic descent from
[Peter](Peter "Peter") and believes itself to be the truest
authoritative expression of Christianity. Historically, Roman
Catholicism became distinct in the Middle Ages when the Eastern
church and the Western church split in what is called the
[Great Schism](Great_Schism "Great Schism") of 1054 A.D. The
Eastern church is now typically referred to as
[Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy"), while
the Western church came to be referred informally as the
*Roman Catholic Church* (Catholics call their church
*The Catholic Church*, pointing to the many eastern Catholic rites
which are part of it, thus denying that they are solely a Western
church). However, both groups trace a lineage back to the time at
which they separated, and from that point back, as a united church,
to the time of the [Apostles](Apostle "Apostle"). Roman Catholicism
specifically traces itself back to
[Linus](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Linus "wikipedia:Pope Linus"),
bishop and successor of [Peter](Peter "Peter") in leadership of the
first century Church at Rome. This is supported by the writings of
[Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus"), who lived and wrote in the latter
part of the second century.

The Roman Catholic Church subsequently encountered division of its
own in the 16th century
[Protestant Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation"),
led initially by [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"),
although Luther's intention was not to create a new Christianity
but to internally reform the teachings of the church. Rather than
accept radical reform, the Roman church excommunicated the
"reformers" which thereby gave rise to
[Protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism") with its numerous
denominations, many of which developed distinctive theological
perspectives.

Roman Catholicism contains a number of doctrines which Protestants
view as unbiblical, such as the doctrine of
[Transubstantiation](Transubstantiation "Transubstantiation"), the
veneration and intercession of deceased [saints](Saint "Saint"),
[prayers for the dead](Prayers_for_the_dead "Prayers for the dead"),
[purgatory](Purgatory "Purgatory"), the immaculate conception and
bodily assumption of [Mary](Mariology "Mariology"), and
[papal](Papacy "Papacy") infallibility. These teachings evolved
over time. While many were in place by the middle ages, some did
not become Roman dogma until much later, e.g. Mary's immaculate
conception (Pope Pius IV, 1854), and the bodily assumption of Mary
(Pope Pius XII, 1950).

The most important medieval theologian of Roman Catholicism has
been without question
[Thomas Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") (1225-1274). His
*Summa Theologica* is still considered one of the most definitive
collections of Roman Catholic theology.^[[1]](#note-0)^
