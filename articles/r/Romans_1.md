## Verses 1-17 - Introduction

[Paul](Paul "Paul") introduces the epistle with a reference to his
calling. "Paul... called to be an aposlte, set apart for the gospel
of God" (v.1). He immediately turns his focus to the gospel, "which
[God] promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy
Scriptures" (v.2).

This good news of [God](God "God") is concerning his Son (v.3).
Paul introduces the theme of this epistle and of his ministry-- the
gospel of God concerning his Son. The gospel concerning the Son of
God was promised through the [prophets](Prophet "Prophet") in the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament"). It is a gospel
promised beforehand^[[1]](#note-0)^. The promise that was made
beforehand was indeed a promise from God to his people and the
nations that he would forgive iniquity and account righteous (Isa.
53:11) those who trust in the [Messiah](Messiah "Messiah"). This
Messiah would pour out [grace](Grace "Grace") and
[mercy](Mercy "Mercy") (Zech. 12:10); put an end to sin and atone
for it to bring everlasting righteousness (Dan. 9:24). This was the
promise of the Messiah. The NT is the revelation of the person of
the Messiah. Matt. 1:21, "you shall call his name
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")." Jesus is the embodiment of the gospel
promise, he is the gospel person. Grace and truth came through
Jesus Christ (John 1:14, 16-17). The good news of God is Jesus
Christ!

In his brief description of the Gospel in Rom 1:2-6, Paul
introduces a number of key themes to the book. The first and most
important theme is Jesus. Paul describes him in a number of ways;
the descendent of [David](David "David"), the Son of God, Lord and
the [Christ](Christ "Christ") or [Messiah](Messiah "Messiah"). All
of these titles are discussed further in
[the main article on Romans](Romans#Christology "Romans"). Paul
also says that Jesus rose from the dead, and that all people are
called to have faith in his name and to belong to him. This passage
also introduces the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") and
the concept of Jew / Gentile relations within the Church.

Rom 1:7-15 is a personal note to the Church in Rome from Paul,
telling them how much he loves them and his intention to visit
them. He also explains that he has so far been unable to get to
Rome because of his commitments to preaching the Gospel in other
places. However he is just as keen to preach the same Gospel to the
Romans when he is able to get there. This passage is one of the
clues as to the purpose of Romans, it suggests that Paul is writing
to them in preparation for him journeying there.

Rom 1:16-17 is a very famous passage in which Paul explains his
commitment to the Gospel, stating that it is the power of
salvation. This passage also introduces the key term
“righteousness” which is very important in the letter. This
righteousness comes through faith, which has already been revealed
in Rom 1:5 to be faith in Jesus. This passage also highlights the
Jew / Gentile issue that is very important in Romans, and makes the
point that salvation is equally available to both (ie, all
humanity). The phrase “first for the Jew and then for the Gentile”
is a reflection of Paul’s own ministry pattern. When he arrived in
a city, he would first preach in the synagogue before then
preaching to Gentile hearers.

### Translation Issues

This section holds some very important translation issues.

In modern times, the most controversial translation is of ‘the
righteousness of God’ (δικαιοσυνη θεου). This phrase appears 8
times in Romans (Rom 1:17, 3:5, 21, 22, 25, 26; 10:3) and is
grammatically ambiguous. Excluding contextual issues, the
translation possibilities include:^[[2]](#note-1)^

1.  Righteousness that comes from God – is given or declared by
    him.
2.  Righteousness that is an attribute of God’s nature.
3.  Righteousness that is an action of God.

The complexities of this issue are too big for this section, but
are (will be) discussed in the
[main Romans article](Romans#Righteousness "Romans").

The passage ‘from faith to faith’ (εκ πιστεως εις πιστιν) is
ambiguous, and might mean a number of different things. Among the
options are:^[[3]](#note-2)^

-   A change from the faith in the Law to faith in the Gospel
-   From the faith of the preacher to the faith of the hearer (one
    of Augustine’s suggestions)
-   The development of faith to more faith (Calvin)
-   God’s faithfulness leads to our faith (Barth)
-   Always about faith – faith from first to last (NIV) or faith
    and nothing but faith

Paul’s quote in verse 17 comes from Hab 2:4 is slightly different
than the original, and the language that he used reintroduces
ambiguity that is not in the original Hebrew.

## Verses 18-32 - The Sin of Humanity

This section introduces the reason that a Gospel of salvation is
needed – because God’s wrath is upon humanity. The rest of the
chapter explains why God is angry as it describes the sinfulness of
humanity. This passage is in three sections, each of which lay out
a description of the primary sin committed by humanity, and then
God’s response and punishment (Rom 1:18-24, 25-27, 28-32). In each
section the primary sin is set in terms of relationship to God.
Humanity has the chance to know God (at least in part) through his
creation, but they fail to worship him or give thanks to him, and
instead worshipped idols that represent the creation rather than
the creator. This is shown as a *conscious* decision to suppress
the truth which shows the guilt of humanity. Because humans *know*
the truth about God, and have had it *revealed* to them, their
decision to reject it is deliberate, without excuse and deserving
of punishment.

Each section then lays out part of the consequences of rejecting
God with the same formula ‘God gave them over’ (παρεδωκεν αυτους ο
θεος). This phrase shows that the sinful behaviors listed after are
a result of the original sinful cause (failure to worship God). It
also shows that God has allowed humanity to be mired in its own
sinfulness and in the self-destructive behavior that is the result
of our sin. The list of sinful behavior is both damning and
comprehensive, ranging quickly from ‘major’ sins such as murder to
‘minor’ ones such as gossiping (Rom 1:19). The final line (Rom
1:32) shows that humanity is not only committing sinful behavior,
but does not think that it is wrong, and approves of the fact that
people do these things.

This passage also highlights the *foolishness* of sin. Paul
contrasts people who think that they are wise but commit foolish
acts (Rom 1:21-22). This, and Rom 1:32 makes a comment on 'earthly
wisdom', showing that what the world approves of is, in general,
opposed to God.

### General Revelation

Rom 1:19-20 is often referred to in the discussions about
[General revelation](General_revelation "General revelation").
There is debate about the extent and nature of the revealing that
is mentioned in this passage.

1.  God reveals parts of his nature, possibly enough for salvation,
    but sin makes it totally impossible for humanity to recognize it.
2.  God reveals parts of his nature, and humanity is able to
    recognize it, but it is not enough for a saving knowledge of God.
3.  God reveals enough for salvation.

Considering the context of the rest of the New Testament and
Romans, only the first and second options are viable. Part of the
issue is the interpretation of Rom 1:19, which in the Greek refers
to 'that which is known/knowable about God' (το γνωστον τομ θεου).
This raises the issue of whether it is everythig that humans can
know, or everything that *sinful* humans can know about God.
Evangelical scholars are split between the two, but the net effect
is the same – saving knowledge of God is only available through
Jesus.
