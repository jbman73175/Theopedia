This chapter is a continuation of the argument from Rom 3:21-31,
where he argues that justification is available to humanity through
faith in Jesus. Rom 3:28-31 raises the problem of whether God’s
free justification through Jesus is contrary to the Jewish Law,
which is also from God. In Rom 3:31, Paul contends that this
justification is not contrary to the law, rather it supports it.
Chapter 4 explains Paul’s reasoning for this.

Paul’s primary point is that Abraham was justified before God
because he believed God’s promise, and that happened before any
part of the Law was given, including circumcision. Therefore,
Abraham is not a symbol of people being justified by the Law,
rather he is a symbol of people who are justified by faith in God –
whether or not they have the Jewish Law (Rom 4:11-12). Paul holds
up Abraham as a model of faith in God despite great difficulty and
doubt (Rom 4:18-21).
