## Summary

In chapter 5, Paul continues the main thread of his argument from
Rom 3:21-31 where he argued that people are justified through faith
in God alone. In Chapter 4, he supported his claim by demonstrating
that Abraham was justified by faith before the Jewish Law was
given. In Rom 5:1-11, he returns to his original point and works
through the implications of justification by faith.

### Verses 1-11

The first implication of justification by faith is that we now, in
the present, are at peace with God (Rom 5:1) when we previously
were under his wrath (Rom 1:18). This peace means that we now stand
in his grace (Rom 5:2), which implies both his gracious
forgiveness, and the way that he blesses his children. The second
implication looks to the future – we have the hope of God’s glory
which is described further in Rom 8:18-25. This future hope changes
our priorities, and our understanding of our sufferings (Rom
5:3-5). Since our hope is in God and the future glory, present
sufferings build up our character and produce hope, so are things
that we can rejoice in. Finally, Paul says, the reason why our hope
in Christ is not disappointed is because our hope is not based on
us. Our hope is based upon the love of God that was poured out on
us through the Holy Spirit.

In Rom 5:6-8, Paul explains the extent of the love of God that has
been poured out on us. Very few people would even die for righteous
or good people, so how much more does God love us that he died for
people who were his enemies at the time! Instead, we are now
children of God and objects of the Father's love through the Son.

Rom 5:9-11 echoes many of the themes of Rom 5:1-3. Both start with
the phrase “since we have been justified” (δικαιωθέντες). Both
contain the strong phrase “not only this but...” (οὐ μόνον δέ and
ἀλλὰ καi). And both also contain the language of “boasting” or
“glorying” (καυχάομαι). This passage picks up from 5:5 and
continues to explain the implications of being justified through
the death of Jesus. We are saved from God’s wrath (Rom 5:9) and are
reconciled to him (5:10-11).
