R. J. Rushdoony
**Rousas John Rushdoony** (1916 - 2001) was the seminal leader of
the
[Christian Reconstructionist](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Reconstructionism "wikipedia:Christian Reconstructionism")
theology in the United States. He was the founder, in 1965, of the
Chalcedon Foundation, and the editor of its monthly magazine, the
*Chalcedon Report* and publisher of the
*Journal of Christian Reconstruction*.

Rushdoony was born in New York the son of Armenian immigrants. He
was educated at the University of California, Berkeley, where he
earned a B.A. in English in 1938, a teaching credential in 1939 and
a Master of Arts in Education in 1940. He also attended the Pacific
School of Religion. He later received an honorary Doctorate from
Valley Christian University for his book,
*The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum*.

## Intellectual career

His first book, in 1959, was an analysis of the philosophy of
Christian apologist
[Cornelius Van Til](Cornelius_Van_Til "Cornelius Van Til"),
entitled *By What Standard?* He also wrote several book reviews
that were published in the *Westminster Theological Journal*, and
many other books applying the Van Tillian
[Presuppositional philosophy](Presuppositional_apologetics "Presuppositional apologetics")
to critiquing various aspects of secular humanism.

Rushdoony had an early focus on behalf of homeschooling, which he
saw as a way to combat the secular nature of the U.S. public school
system, and he vigorously attacked the progressives who had
influenced the development of said education system, such as Horace
Mann and John Dewey. He also stressed that
[Christianity](Christianity "Christianity") had always been present
in U.S. history; and while he supported separation of church and
state at the national level, he claimed that the First Amendment
was designed to protect the already existing "state churches" in
each of the colonies—thus, the amendment had not been designed to
wholly secularize society.

Perhaps his most renowned and influential work is
*The Institutes of Biblical Law*, with the title modeled after
[Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin")'s
*Institutes of the Christian Religion*. In it he proposed that
biblical law should be applied to modern society — to wit, that
there should be a Christian
[theocracy](index.php?title=Theocracy&action=edit&redlink=1 "Theocracy (page does not exist)");
and discussed how to go about doing this. His work has been used by
[Dominion Theology](index.php?title=Dominion_Theology&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dominion Theology (page does not exist)")
advocates, who would attempt to implement a Christian theocracy in
the USA. He also proposed great freedom in the economic realm of
public life, following in this the ideas of Ludwig von Mises and
calling himself a Christian
[libertarian](index.php?title=Libertarian&action=edit&redlink=1 "Libertarian (page does not exist)").

Rushdoony was an early board member of the Rutherford Institute,
founded in 1982 by John W. Whitehead. His son-in-law,
[Gary North](index.php?title=Gary_North&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gary North (page does not exist)"),
is a
[Christian Reconstructionist](index.php?title=Christian_Reconstructionist&action=edit&redlink=1 "Christian Reconstructionist (page does not exist)")
writer and economist.
