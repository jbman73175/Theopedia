Rowan Williams
**Rowan Williams**, born 1950 in Swansea, south Wales, is the
current and 104th Archbishop of Canterbury. In this position, Rowan
is the leader of the 77 million-strong worldwide
[Anglican Communion](Anglicanism "Anglicanism").

He studied at Christ’s College, Cambridge, where he earned
bachelor’s and master’s degrees in theology; he was awarded a
doctorate of philosophy in theology by Wadham College, Oxford, in
1975. After teaching at the College of the Resurrection, Mirfield,
he held a series of academic and ecclesiastical appointments,
culminating in his professorship of divinity at Oxford (1986–92).
He became bishop of Monmouth in 1992 and was enthroned as
archbishop of Wales in 2000. His nomination as archbishop of
Canterbury in 2002 generated significant controversy because of his
liberal views on homosexuality and other matters, though he was
supported by stalwarts of the church such as the Reverend Desmond
Tutu.^[[1]](#note-0)^
