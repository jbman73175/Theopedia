Rudolf Bultmann
**Rudolf Karl Bultmann** (1884 - 1976) was a German
[Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran")
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian"). He is well known for his
"demythologizing" of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), and was influenced
by the [existentialism](Existentialism "Existentialism") of
[Martin Heidegger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger "w:Martin Heidegger").
Educated at the universities of Tübingen, Berlin, and Marburg,
Bultmann taught at the universities of Breslau and Giessen and from
1921 to 1950 was professor at the University of Marburg.

His two most influential works were the
*History of the Synoptic Tradition*, published in 1921, in which he
was one of four German Protestant Scripture scholars to introduce
the form-criticism of the New Testament, and his 1941 essay on
*The New Testament and Mythology*, in which he called for the
"demythologizing" of the New Testament. In his program of
"demythologizing," he called upon Christian scholars and preachers
to bring the Gospel message honestly into conformity with what they
now knew (from the results of historical criticism) was not
historically true in the Gospels and, therefore, to adjust their
Christian appeal to a new existentialist theology.

    In this dialogue with philosopher Jaspers, Jaspers first makes the
    case that Christianity can not be understood apart from its
    mythical framework, and that myth is necessary form of
    communication through symbol. Bultman responds that modern
    scientific analysis of the text is required to separate the genuine
    from the miraculous claims, thereby revealing the true message.
