**Sacramentalism** is, according to the , "the doctrine that
observance of the sacraments is necessary for salvation and that
such participation can confer grace.^[1](#bib_1)^"

## The nature of sacramentalism

### Sacraments

It would be impossible to discuss Sacramentalism without first
identifying what a sacrament is. The word sacrament itself comes
from the same Latin root as the word sacred, saint, and other words
in that family. Its most literal meaning is a "Holy
Obligation.^[2](#bib_2)^" In modern language, though, a sacrament
would best be described as an act that a person performs, and
through which, the grace of God is conferred to that person. The
Catechism of the Catholic Church puts it this way: "The sacraments
are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted
to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. the visible
rites by which the sacraments are celebrated signify and make
present the graces proper to each sacrament.^[3](#bib_3)^"
