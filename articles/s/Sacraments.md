A **sacrament** is a rite or ceremony instituted by Jesus, and
observed by the church as a means of or visible sign of grace. The
English word *sacrament* is from the Latin *sacramentum*, which
means to make holy, or to consecrate.

[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") and
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox") indentify
seven secraments, while most [Protestant](Protestant "Protestant")
denominations give special significance to only two as specifically
ordained in Scripture, [Baptism](Baptism "Baptism") and
[Communion](Communion "Communion").

Sacraments are ceremonial in nature, which separates them from
other things that Jesus instructed us to do (e.g. "go and make
disciples of all nations" Matthew 28:18) that are practical and
naturally effective. Sacraments, in contrast, are effective by
inward and supernatural means.

## Enumeration

The numeration, naming, understanding, and the adoption of the
sacraments vary according to denomination. Generally, seven
sacraments are in view:

-   Baptism
-   Confirmation
-   Eucharist (or Communion)
-   Matrimony
-   Holy Orders (Ordination)
-   Penance, Confession, and Reconciliation
-   Anointing of the Sick (or Extreme Unction, Last Rites)

Other names are used by other Christian bodies for the sacraments
which they recognize, notably
[Chrismation](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrismation "wikipedia:Chrismation")
is the name for the reception of the seal of the Holy Spirit in the
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox "Eastern Orthodox") Church.

## Historical Recognition of the Sacraments

The identification of sacraments as "signs" can be traced back to
[St. Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") who said: "the signs of
divine things are, it is true, things visible, but ... invisible
things themselves are also honored in them."
([De Cat. Rud. 26.50](http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF1-03/npnf1-03-25.htm#P3083_1442069))

The [Council of Trent](Council_of_Trent "Council of Trent") in the
[Tridentine Creed](Tridentine_Creed "Tridentine Creed") interpreted
this as follows in mid sixteenth century: "A Sacrament is a visible
sign of an invisible grace"

Christians have differed widely as to the meaning of the sacraments
and how God works through them.
[Catholics](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic"), and many
[Protestants](Protestant "Protestant"), consider them means of
grace through which God bestows spiritual blessing. This view was
held by [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") and
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"). Other Protestants,
following
[Huldreich Zwingli](Huldreich_Zwingli "Huldreich Zwingli"), view
the sacraments as signs of Christian profession and testimony to
grace that has already been given through faith.

## Protestants

[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") denominations generally
recognize only two sacraments as specifically ordained in
Scripture:

-   [Baptism](Baptism "Baptism")
-   [Communion](Communion "Communion") (also called the *Eucharist*
    or the *Lord's Supper*)

Most Protestants consider only the "evangelical" sacraments of
Baptism and Communion to be sacraments *per se*, understanding
these to be the only such practices directly instituted by Jesus,
as reported in the Gospels. They hold that the other five rites are
not made sacraments by the New Testament. So while Protestant
churches have marriage ceremonies, and many have ordained clergy
and a ceremony conferring ordination, they consider these rites to
be *ordinances* rather than sacraments.

Some [Anabaptist](Anabaptists "Anabaptists") and Brethren groups
consider foot-washing to be a sacrament. "Some Protestant groups,
notably the Quakers and the Salvation Army, do not use sacraments."

## Anglican

The foundational
[Thirty-Nine Articles](Articles_of_Religion_(Anglican) "Articles of Religion (Anglican)")
of [Anglicans](Anglican "Anglican") and Episcopalians recognize
only the two primary sacraments:

"There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the
Gospel, that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord. Those
five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation,
Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and extreme Unction, are not to be
counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown
partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states
of life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of
Sacraments with Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, for that they have
not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God."
[Article XXV](http://www.prayerbook.ca/bcp/39_articles.html#25)
Anglicans, like Catholics, base their definition of *sacrament* on
[St. Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") in their
[Catechism](Anglican_Catechism "Anglican Catechism"). As stated in
the 1979 Episcopal
[Book of Common Prayer](Book_of_Common_Prayer "Book of Common Prayer"):

"The sacraments are outward and visible signs of inward and
spiritual grace, given by Christ as sure and certain means by which
we receive that grace." (See [[2]](http://www.bcponline.org/) under
the *Catechism*, p. 857)
The [Anglican Catechism](Anglican_Catechism "Anglican Catechism")
follows Article XXV in distinguishing between the two major
sacraments (Baptism and the Eucharist), the "sacraments of the
Gospel" and the "other sacramental rites which evolved in the
Church" but is less dismissive of those extra five:

"Although they are means of grace, they are not necessary for all
persons in the same way that Baptism and the Eucharist are." (ibid.
p. 860)
## Catholics and Orthodox

The seven sacraments accepted by Roman Catholicism are generally
also accepted by Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy, as well,
but the latter traditions do not limit the number of sacraments to
seven, holding that anything the Church does as Church is in some
sense sacramental. To be more accurate, for the Eastern Orthodox
and Oriental Orthodox Christian the term “Sacrament” is a
Westernism that seeks to classify something that may be impossible
to classify.

The Roman Catholic Church traces the canonical use of seven
sacraments to the mid-twelfth century, which were formally decided
at the [Council of Trent](Council_of_Trent "Council of Trent")
(1545) in response to Protestant innovations.
