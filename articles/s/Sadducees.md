**Sadducees** were a political-religious sect of the Jews. As a
prominent political party they first appear in the reign of John
Hyrcanus (135-105 BC). The Sadducees were the party of high
priests, aristocratic families, and merchants â€” the wealthier
elements of the population. They came under the influence of
[Hellenism](Hellenism "Hellenism"), and tended to have good
relations with the Roman rulers of Palestine. While their rivals,
the [Pharisees](Pharisees "Pharisees"), claimed the authority of
piety and learning, the Sadducees claimed that of birth and social
and economic position. During the long struggle between the two
parties (which lasted until the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in
70 AD) the Sadducees dominated the Temple and its priesthood.

In contrast to the Pharisees, the Sadducees denied the concept of a
general [resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection"), the
immortality of the soul and the existence of
[angels](Angels "Angels") (Matthew 22:23; Mark 12:18; Acts 23:8).
They did not deny the existence of an afterlife per se, but did not
believe that everyone was automatically granted
one.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
They did allow as how exemplary Jews such as [Moses](Moses "Moses")
and [David](David "David") and
[Elijah](index.php?title=Elijah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Elijah (page does not exist)")
might be saved by God based on their exemplary accomplishments, but
they made it very clear that this was an exception, and not the
rule.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
They also rejected the oral traditions which the Pharisees
maintained and emphasized as a divinely ordained supplement to the
written law.

Much of what is known about the Sadducees comes from
[Josephus](Josephus "Josephus"), who wrote that they were a
quarrelsome group whose followers were wealthy and powerful, and
that he considered them boorish in social interactions (see
Josephus' *Wars of the Jews*, Book II, Chapter VIII, Paragraph
14).
