In the Bible, the word **saint** comes from the same Greek root as
the words "sanctify" and
"[sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification")," and is related
in meaning as expressed in the following:

-   sanctify (*hagiaso*) - to set apart for a holy purpose.
-   sanctification (*hagiasmon*) - the state or process of being
    set apart, or made holy.
-   saint (*hagion*) - one who has been set apart or made holy by
    faith in Christ.

As the apostle Paul said in the opening of his epistle to the
Colossians, "To the **saints** and faithful brothers in Christ at
Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father," (Col. 1:2).

In the context of Scripture, the word "saint" is not a description
of a special class of Christian or a reference to one who is deemed
especially holy (as used by the Roman church), but is a simple
reference to Christians -- emphasizing that they have been set
apart by God.
