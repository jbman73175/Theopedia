**Salvation**^[[1]](#note-0)^ refers to the act of God's grace in
delivering his people from bondage to [sin](Sin "Sin") and
condemnation, transferring them to the kingdom of his beloved Son
(Col. 1:13), and giving them
[eternal life](Eternal_life "Eternal life") (Romans 6:23)—all on
the basis of what Christ accomplished in his
[atoning sacrifice](Atonement "Atonement"). The
[Bible](Bible "Bible") says we are saved by grace through faith;
and that not of ourselves, it is the gift of God (Ephesians 2:8).

In [theology](Theology "Theology"), the study of salvation is
called **soteriology**, from the Greek *soteria* meaning
"salvation". Salvation, virtually synonymous with the overall
concept of [redemption](Redemption "Redemption"), includes a past,
present, and future sense. As Christians, we were saved from the
penalty of sin when [God](God "God") brought us to faith in
[Christ](Jesus "Jesus"); we are presently being saved from the
power of sin as the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit")
[sanctifies](Sanctification "Sanctification") us; and we will
someday be saved from the presence of sin when we meet Christ face
to face in glory. This idea is presented below in terms of initial,
progressive, and final salvation.

## Man's condition

All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Rom 3:23).
Apart from Christ, we are "weak" and "ungodly" (Rom 5:6), "sinners"
(Rom 5:8), under the coming "wrath of God" (Rom 5:9), "enemies" of
God in need of "reconciliation" and salvation (Rom 5:10), under the
"judgment" and reigning "death" that followed Adam's "one trespass"
(Rom 5:16-17), "enslaved to sin" (Rom 6:6, 16-17, 20), presenting
our "members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to
more lawlessness" (Rom 6:19), "of the flesh, sold under sin" (Rom
7:14), having "nothing good" dwelling in our flesh (Rom 7:18),
having bodies "of death" in need of deliverance (Rom 7:24),
"hostile to God" (Rom 8:7), the fruit and wages of which are death
and condemnation (Rom 6:21, 23; 8:1).

## Coming judgment

"It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes
judgment." (Hebrews 9:27) Apart from Christ, we are "by nature
children of wrath, like the rest of mankind." (Ephesians 2:3) Those
with "hard and impenitent heart[s]... are storing up wrath for
[themselves] on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will
be revealed." (Romans 2:5) "[F]or those who are self-seeking and do
not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath
and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human
being who does evil..." (2:8-9) "They will suffer the punishment of
eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from
the glory of his might..." (2 Thessalonians 1:9)

*See also: [Justice of God](Justice_of_God "Justice of God"), [Wrath of God](Wrath_of_God "Wrath of God"), and [Hell](Hell "Hell")*

## Initial salvation

Initial salvation refers to the event of a person's
[conversion](Conversion "Conversion"). If you
[repent](Repent "Repent") of your [sin](Sin "Sin") and turn in
[faith](Faith "Faith") to Christ as Lord and Savior, your sins are
immediately forgiven, your fight of faith has begun, and your
future in Christ is secured forever. "Everyone who calls on the
name of the Lord will be saved." (Romans 10:13) "He saved us, not
because of works done by us in
[righteousness](Righteousness "Righteousness"), but according to
his own [mercy](Mercy "Mercy"), by the washing of
[regeneration](Regeneration "Regeneration") and renewal of the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit"), whom he poured out on us
richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by
his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of
[eternal life](Eternal_life "Eternal life")." (Titus 3:3-7)

*See also: [Irresistible grace](Irresistible_grace "Irresistible grace"), [Regeneration](Regeneration "Regeneration"), [Justification](Justification "Justification"), [Prevenient grace](Prevenient_grace "Prevenient grace"), [Union with Christ](Union_with_Christ "Union with Christ"), and [Adoption](Adoption "Adoption")*

## Progressive salvation

Progressive salvation refers to the journey of a believer between
conversion and death. It is the only path that leads to eternal
life (Romans 6:20-23), and is walked by faith alone, in the power
of the Holy Spirit (Romans 8, Galatians 3:2-5). It contains bumps
and struggles and setbacks, but is marked by growth in
[love](Love "Love") for others and for God. It involves a fight of
faith, a striving for peace and holiness (Hebrews 12:14, 1 John
1:9), and a reoccurring approach of the throne of grace (Hebrews
4:16). "[O]ur Lord Jesus Christ... will sustain you to the end,
guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by
whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ
our Lord." (1 Corinthians 1:7-9)

*See also: [Sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification"), [Assurance of salvation](Assurance_of_salvation "Assurance of salvation"), [Means of grace](Means_of_grace "Means of grace"), [Gifts of the Spirit](Gifts_of_the_Spirit "Gifts of the Spirit"), and [Perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints")*

## Final salvation

Final salvation refers to the event of God saving his people at the
final judgment, the great divide between sheep and goats, wherein
sheep are identified by their work of faith and labor of love and
steadfastness of hope in the Lord Jesus Christ, and accepted on the
ground of their union with Christ, the righteous substitute.

*See also: [Final judgment](Final_judgment "Final judgment"), [Justification](Justification "Justification")*

## Results of salvation

*See also: [Adoption](Adoption "Adoption"), [Sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification"), [Resurrection](Resurrection "Resurrection"), [Heaven](Heaven "Heaven"), [Beatific vision](index.php?title=Beatific_vision&action=edit&redlink=1 "Beatific vision (page does not exist)"), and [Glorification](Glorification "Glorification")*

## Other areas

Another aspect of salvation is the biblical doctrine of
[election](Election "Election"). Election to salvation may be
defined as God's eternal purpose to save some of the human race in
and by Jesus Christ. The Bible discusses election in 3 ways:

1.  The election of Israel as the Old Testament people of God (e.g.
    Deut 4:37)
2.  The election of individuals for specific roles of serivce or
    office (e.g. 1 Samuel 10:24)
3.  The election of individuals for salvation (e.g. Ephesians 1:4)

## Notes

1.  [↑](#ref-0) In its generic sense, the word *salvation* refers
    to deliverance or rescue from some undesirable state or condition.
