**Sanctification**, or in its verbal form, **sanctify**, literally
means "to set apart" for special use or purpose, that is, to make
[holy](Holy "Holy") or sacred. Therefore, sanctification refers to
the state or process of being set apart, i.e. made holy. In
systematic theology, the term often carries a technical meaning
that differs from the biblical word group.^[[1]](#note-0)^
Sanctification is regularly equated with the Christian life. In
Wesleyan theology, it can refer to a moment of "Entire
Sanctification," in which one reaches a state of
[Christian Perfection](Wesleyan_perfectionism "Wesleyan perfectionism").

In Christianity, the term can be used to refer to objects which are
set apart for special purposes, but the most common use within
Christian [theology](Theology "Theology") is in reference to the
change brought about by God in a believer, begun at the point of
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") or
[justification](Justification "Justification") and continuing
throughout the life of the believer. Many forms of
[Christianity](Christianity "Christianity") believe that this
process will only be completed in [Heaven](Heaven "Heaven") when
believers are also glorified, but some believe that complete
holiness is possible in this life.

In many branches of Christianity, inanimate objects as well as
people can be sanctified. A notable instance is the process of
[transubstantiation](Transubstantiation "Transubstantiation"),
which in [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") doctrine
means that the bread and wine of [Communion](Communion "Communion")
are physically transformed into the flesh and blood (respectively)
of Jesus. This act constitutes a kind of sanctification of the
bread and wine.

The term has gathered special uses by the different
[denominations](Denominations "Denominations") of Christianity. For
[Protestants](Protestant "Protestant"), the concept of
sanctification is tied closely to [grace](Grace "Grace") and the
term is usually reserved for reference to people rather than
objects. Following a particular reading of the doctrine of the
[perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints"),
the word "sanctified" can be used as a shorthand for "born again"
in the sense of "set apart by God." However, this usage is rare in
churches of the [Anglican](Anglican "Anglican") communion and the
Roman Catholic Church, where sanctification refers to the
conveyance of blessing.

## Progressive sanctification

"Indeed, the more sanctified the person is, the more conformed he
is to the image of his Savior, the more he must recoil against
every lack of conformity to the holiness of God. The deeper his
apprehension of the majesty of God, the greater the intensity of
his love to God, the more persistent his yearning for the
attainment of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus,
the more conscious will he be of the gravity of the sin that
remains and the more poignant will be his detestation of it....Was
this not the effect in all the people of God as they came into
closer proximity to the revelation of God’s holiness."
