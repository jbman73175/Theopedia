**Sandemanianism** refers primarily to an aspect of theology
regarding the nature of faith promoted by Robert Sandeman
(1718-1781), from which it derives its name, and his father-in-law
John Glas (1695-1773) in Scotland and England during the mid 18th
century.

To the Sandemanians, the nature of saving faith reduces to mere
intellectual assent to a fact or proposition. This is illustrated
rather clearly in the following quote. "In a series of letters to
James Hervey, the author of *Theron and Aspasia*, he [Sandeman]
maintained that justifying faith is a simple assent to the divine
testimony concerning Jesus Christ, differing in no way in its
character from belief in any ordinary testimony."^[[1]](#note-0)^

Those who hold to the concept of
[Lordship salvation](Lordship_salvation "Lordship salvation") argue
that the view espoused by proponents of
[Non-Lordship salvation](Non-Lordship_salvation "Non-Lordship salvation")
is essentially the errant view of the 18th century Sandemanians.
