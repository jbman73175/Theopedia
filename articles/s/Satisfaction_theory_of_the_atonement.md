The **Satisfaction (or Commercial) theory** of the atonement was
formulated by the medieval theologian [Anselm](Anselm "Anselm") of
Canterbury (1033-1109) in his book, *Cur Deus Homo* (lit.
*‘Why the God Man’*). In his view, God’s offended honor and dignity
could only be satisfied by the sacrifice of the God-man, Jesus
Christ.

Anslem believed that humans could not render to God more than what
was due to him. The satisfaction due to God was greater than what
all created beings are capable of doing, since they can only do
what is already required of them. Therefore, God had to make
satisfaction for himself. Yet if this satisfaction was going to
avail for humans, it had to be made by a human. Therefore only a
being that was both God and man could satisfy God and give him the
honor that is due him.

The classic Anselmian formulation of the Satisfaction View needs to
be distinguished from
[Penal Substitution](Penal_substitution_theory_of_the_atonement "Penal substitution theory of the atonement").
Penal Substitution states that Christ bore the *penalty* for sin,
*in place of* those sinners united to him by faith. Anselm, by
contrast, regarded human sin as defrauding God of the honour he is
due. Christ's death, the ultimate act of obedience, gives God great
honour. As it was beyond the call of duty for Christ, it is more
honour than he was obliged to give. Christ's surplus can therefore
repay our deficit. Hence Christ's death is substitutionary in this
sense: he pays the honour instead of us. But that substitution is
not penal; his death pays our honour not our penalty.

The Protestant reformers shifted the focus of this satisfaction
theory to concentrate not merely on divine offense but on divine
justice. God's righteousness demands punishment for human sin. God
in his grace both exacts punishment and supplies the one to bear
it.

This is an important difference. For Anselm, Christ obeyed where we
should have obeyed; for John Calvin, he was punished where we
should have been punished.

## Background

Anselm was made Archbishop of Canterbury following the Norman
conquest. His theory of the atonement relied heavily on the feudal
system of his day, in which serfs worked on an estate for an
overlord. The overlord - a knight - protected the estate from
attack. The knight in turn had to honor the King. The serfs owed
the knight a debt of honor for their protection and livelihood.
Anselm pictured God as the overlord of the world to whom is owed a
debt of honor. Failure to honor God is therefore a sin. God cannot
overlook such an offence and demands satisfaction. While it is man
who owes such a debt to God, the only person capable of paying the
debt is God himself. God therefore became man so that he himself
could satisfy God's offended character. Christ's death accrued a
superabundance of merit (also known as supererogation), which is
now available for distribution to those who believe.

Anselm's theory takes seriously the gravity of sin and the holiness
of God. Unfortunately it goes beyond what the Bible teaches and
reads in too much of a culture foreign to the Scriptures. The
satisfaction of God's character that is described is totally
external to the individual believer. There is no personal response
involved or any change worked on the individual.

## Weaknesses

Sin is viewed as the withholding of honor due to God. In his death,
since he was under no obligation to die, being sinless, Christ
brought infinite glory to God. This brought a reward to Christ that
he did not need so he passes it on to sinners if they live
according to the gospel (supererogation). Thus, the basis for
receiving the benefit of Christ's death is works. While Anselm's
interpretation permitted man to offer Christ to God, the Protestant
Faith insists that it is God, not man, who reconciles fallen
humanity by sacrificing His son. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)
developed Anselm’s theory more fully, including the “treasury of
merit” concept, which became the general understanding of the
atonement in Roman Catholicism.

In addition to basing the necessity of the atonement on the honor
of God rather than the justice of God (consistent with the later
Reformers), Anselm’s theory rules out Christ's bearing the penalty
of sin and dying in the sinner’s stead.
