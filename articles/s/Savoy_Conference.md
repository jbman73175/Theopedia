The **Savoy Conference** took place in 1661 when twelve
[Anglican](Anglican "Anglican") bishops and twelve
[Puritan](Puritan "Puritan") and
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") ministers met to revise
the *Book of Common Prayer*. The Presbyterians sought means to
enable them to remain within the Established Church, but in reply
to their Exceptions to the BCP the bishops made only 17 trivial
concessions. [Richard Baxter](Richard_Baxter "Richard Baxter") was
in attendance.

The 1662 [Act of Uniformity](Act_of_Uniformity "Act of Uniformity")
soon followed.
