The **Savoy Declaration** was a declaration and statement of faith
prepared in 1658 by a conference of English Congregationalists who
met at Savoy Palace, London. Its full title is
*A Declaration of the Faith and Order owned and practiced in the Congregational Churches in England*.
The declaration consisted of three parts: a preface, a confession
of faith, and a platform of discipline. In matters of doctrine it
was primarily a restatement (with some modifications) of the
Presbyterian
[Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")
(1646), but was specifically adapted to suit Congregational polity.
The committee responsible for the declaration included
[Thomas Goodwin](Thomas_Goodwin "Thomas Goodwin"),
[John Owen](John_Owen "John Owen"), Philip Nye, William Bridge,
Joseph Caryl and William Greenhill.

With respect to the WCF, the Savoy Declaration altered chapters 25
and 26, deleted chapters 30 and 31, inserted a new chapter 20, "Of
the Gospel, and of the Extent of the Grace thereof," and added a
platform of Congregational polity in the preface titled "Of the
Institution of Churches, and the Order Appointed in them by Jesus
Christ." The Savoy Declaration was designed to encourage agreement
on important matters between churches; but, true to the nature of
Congregational polity, it was not intended to be a legal or
corporate instrument, as was the Westminster Confession.

## Background

The Westminster Confession was adopted by the General Assembly of
the Scottish Church in 1647 and ratified by the Scottish parliament
in 1649. These acts of the English and Scottish parliaments were
then nullified at the restoration of the Anglican episcopacy
together with the British monarchy in 1660. After the Revolution of
1688, in which the intolerable Roman Catholic King James II was
replaced by William of Orange, the Scottish parliament again
ratified the Confession without change in 1690, to which the royal
sanction was promptly granted by the new King.

In 1658, just two years before the restoration of the monarchy,
about 200 delegates from the Congregational churches of England
gathered in the Savoy palace in London to compose a revision of the
Confession in which the principles of congregational independence
and legal toleration would replace the established Presbyterianism
implicit in the Confession's statements touching Church government
and discipline.
