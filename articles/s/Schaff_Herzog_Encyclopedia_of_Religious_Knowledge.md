The **Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge** is a 1914
religious encyclopedia, published in thirteen volumes. It focuses
on [Christianity](Christianity "Christianity") from a primarily
[Protestant](Protestantism "Protestantism") point of view.

Edited by Philip Schaff (1819-1893) in its English language
version, it was based on the third edition of the
*Realencyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche* founded
by Johann Jakob Herzog (1805-1882), and edited by Albert Hauck.

As of 2004, it is in the **public domain**. The Christian Classics
Ethereal Library has scanned a printed copy, and is in the process
of correcting and marking-up the entire work.
