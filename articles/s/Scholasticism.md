**Scholasticism** comes from the Latin word *scholasticus* which
means "that [which] belongs to the school", and is the school of
philosophy taught by the academics (or *schoolmen*) of medieval
universities circa 1100 - 1500. Scholasticism attempted to
reconcile the philosophy of the ancient classical philosophers with
medieval Christian theology.

The primary purpose of scholasticism was to find the answer to a
question or resolve a contradiction. It is most well known in its
application in medieval theology but was applied to classical
philosophy and other fields of study. It is not a philosophy or
theology on its own, but a tool and method for learning which puts
emphasis on dialectical reasoning.

## Scholastic method

The scholastics would choose a book by a renowned scholar (called
auctor) as a subject of investigation. By reading the book
thoroughly and critically, the disciples learned to appreciate the
theories of the auctor. Other documents related to the source
document would be referenced, such as Church councils, papal
letters, or anything written on the subject, be it ancient text or
contemporary. The points of disagreement and contention between
these multiple sources would be written down. For example, the
[Bible](Bible "Bible")'s apparent contradictions have been written
about by scholars both ancient and contemporary, and so scholastics
would gather all arguments concerning each contradiction, viewing
them from all sides with an open mind.

Once the sources and points of disagreement were laid out through a
series of dialectics, the two sides of an argument would be made
whole so that they would be found to be in agreement and avoid
contradictions. This was accomplished in two ways:

1.  Through the use of *philological analysis* words were examined
    and it was argued that these words could have more than one
    meaning. That is, the author could have intended the word to mean
    something else. Ambiguity in words could be used to find common
    ground between two otherwise contradictory statements.
2.  Through *logical analysis* they sought to show that
    contradictions in fact did not exist, but were subjective to the
    reader.
