**Science and theology** - Often the subject will be called
"religion and science" or "science and religion", where the use of
the conjunction *and* indicates an unspecified relationship. One of
the field's most respected survey books remains the retired Oxford
University professor
[John Hedley Brooke](John_Hedley_Brooke "John Hedley Brooke")'s
*Science and Religion: Some historical Perspectives* (1991). A
highly accessible, yet holding to scholarly standards, is the
illustrated survey work *Exploring Science and Belief* (Michael
Poole, Hendrickson Pub, 2007).

Questions regarding the origins of science from religion (mostly
protestant Christianity) are addressed by Reformed scholar
[Reijer Hooykaas](Reijer_Hooykaas "Reijer Hooykaas")'s
*Religion and the Rise of Modern Science* (1972). A remarkably
comprehensive bibliographic survey of English works in the history
of science and religion, over its intended scope, is
*Science and Religion in the English-Speaking World, 1600-1727: A Bibliographic Guide to the Secondary Literature*
(2001) ^[[1]](#note-0)^.

Perhaps the most notable book in the past three years is Heidi
Cambell and Heather Looy's *A Science and Religion Primer* (2009).
The survey limited to textual sources and significant concepts in
*Primer* (2009) contrasts sharply with the hundreds of pages of
essentially new material found in another recent work
*The Oxford handbook of religion and science* (2006) edited by
Philip Clayton and Zachary R. Simpson.

1.  [↑](#ref-0) The respected historian David C. Lindberg has
    written about this book:

    This bibliography will not, of course, be of much use to scholars
    interested in continental developments, in science–religion
    encounters that occurred before 1600 or after 1727, or in
    scholarship published in the past decade. But given the task the
    authors set for themselves, one must be astonished at their energy
    and dedication. For scholars focused on developments that fall
    within the boundaries chosen by the authors, this volume should
    prove not only useful for bibliographical purposes but also a model
    of bibliographical dedication. —BJHS 38(1) : p.107, March 2005.
