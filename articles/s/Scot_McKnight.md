## Quotes

-   "I agree with the many who have commented that the Table is not
    designed for the pure, the righteous, or the perfect, but for the
    impure, for the unrighteous, and for the imperfect. I see no
    difference: if anyone is seeking God's grace and God's blessing
    through Jesus Christ, they should be welcomed to the Table of the
    Lord. The Table is for cracked Eikons, and only for cracked Eikons.
    The one thing clear from Jesus' table fellowship is that his
    opponents wanted purity before fellowship, and Jesus created purity
    out of fellowship with him." ^[[3]](#note-2)^
