The **Scots Confession** was written in 1560 by six leaders of the
[Protestant Reformation](Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation")
in Scotland, coincidentally all named "John". The Confession was
the first Book of Faith for the Protestant Scottish Church. The Six
Johns were [Knox](John_Knox "John Knox"), Spottiswoode, Willock,
Row, Douglas and Winram. Although the Confession and its
accompanying documents were truly the product of the joint effort
of the six Johns, its authorship is customarily attributed to
[John Knox](John_Knox "John Knox").
