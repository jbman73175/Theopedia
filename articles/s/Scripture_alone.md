**Scripture alone** (from the Reformation slogan
**Sola Scriptura**) is the teaching that [Scripture](Bible "Bible")
is the Church's only infallible and sufficient rule for deciding
issues of faith and practices that involve doctrines. While the
Bible does not contain all knowledge, it does contain that which is
necessary for [salvation](Salvation "Salvation"). Indeed, if
something is not found in Scripture, it is not binding upon the
believer. This view does not deny that the Church has the authority
to teach God's Word. Furthermore, while tradition is valuable, it
but must be tested by the higher authority of the Scriptures.

    [part1](http://www.sbts.edu/MP3/Mohler/20060325mohler03.mp3),
    [part 2](http://www.sbts.edu/MP3/Mohler/20060324mohler02.mp3) by

    3/25/06)

  
Sola Scriptura "does not mean that the Reformers rejected
everything that every Christian in earlier ages has said: indeed,
they often cited the early Christians as supporters of their own
positions. However, they recognized that those earlier believers
were not inspired, were not inerrant, and, in fact, quite often
made errors in their judgments and beliefs, just as people do
today. The only infallible rule of faith, they argued, is found in
the pages of Holy Writ."

In all of this, the role of the
[Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") is vital. The Word can
only be received and obeyed by the Holy Spirit.

  
Catholic Position: The Catholic position on Sola Scriptura differs
from Protestantism. Romans Catholics believe the Bible is inspired
and the infallible original manuscripts. Catholics also do not
believe in Sola Scriptura due to the fact that there is no guide to
decipher important theological issues without the Church. The
Catholic Church collected and organized the Holy Scriptures via
Tradition, and has the Papal Office guiding and helping decipher
important scripture verses.

    [[2]](http://fccphx.homestead.com/SolaScriptura.html)

-   "The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for
    His own glory, man's salvation, faith and life, is either expressly
    set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be
    deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be
    added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of
    men. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the inward illumination of the
    Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such
    things as are revealed in the Word: and that there are some
    circumstances concerning the worship of God, and government of the
    Church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be
    ordered by the light of nature, and Christian prudence, according
    to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed."
