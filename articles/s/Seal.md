A *seal* in Scripture can refer to a royal signet ring, used to
enact a decree (cf. Esther 8:10).

In the New Testament, God seals his believers to mark his ownership
of us (2 Cor 1:22) by the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit")
(Eph. 1:13-14).

2 Corinthians 1:22 
  ~ Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ.
    He anointed us, set his *seal* of ownership on us, and put his
    Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.

Ephesians 1:13-14 
  ~ And you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of
    truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were
    *marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit*, who is a
    deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those
    who are God's possessionâ€”to the praise of his glory.

Adherants of reformed theology believe that circumcision and
baptism are both [signs](Sign "Sign") and seals of the covenant of
grace.

Romans 4:11 
  ~ And he received the sign of circumcision, a *seal* of the
    righteousness that he had by faith while he was still
    uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but
    have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be
    credited to them.
