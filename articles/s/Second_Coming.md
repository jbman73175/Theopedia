The **Second Coming** or *Second Advent* of
[Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") is seen as a yet future
event by Christians. Jesus Christ's first coming, about 2,000 years
ago, was to deal with sin. Before He ascended to heaven, He said,
"if I go away, I will come back"; and His Spirit is given as a
"guarantee" of His return and of our salvation in
Him,^[[1]](#note-0)^ to sustain the Church until His
return.^[[2]](#note-1)^ His return or Second Coming is sometimes
called the **Parousia** (Greek:
*coming presence, arrival*)^[[3]](#note-2)^ and will be for the
judgment of his enemies and the salvation of those who await his
return.^[[4]](#note-3)^ The many
[denominations](Denominations "Denominations") of Christianity vary
widely regarding the details surrounding Christ's return in
relationship to the Great Tribulation and the Millennium. Because
of the many false prophecies of man regarding His return, over the
past 2,000 years, few dare to claim complete and authoritative
interpretation of the many related prophetic biblical passages.
However, it is commonly accepted that:

-   Jesus Christ died on the cross.
-   He was
    [resurrected](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus")
    bodily.
-   He [ascended](Ascension_of_Christ "Ascension of Christ") into
    [heaven](Heaven "Heaven").
-   He will return to earth, judge the world and establish his
    [kingdom](Millennial_Kingdom "Millennial Kingdom"),
-   No one knows the day or hour of Christ's return.

[Daniel](Book_of_Daniel "Book of Daniel"), the
[Gospel of Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew") and the
[Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation") are
considered to be the most fruitful sources of study, although many
parts of the Bible are sprinkled with references to the "last
day(s)" and the "second coming" of Christ. A specific reference to
it is contained in the early ecumenical creeds.

The second coming (or return) of Christ is contained as an article
of faith in all the ancient creeds:

    the living and the dead"
    [Apostles' Creed](Apostles'_Creed "Apostles' Creed").

    the dead" [Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed").
