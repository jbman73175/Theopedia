John wrote this letter in order to emphasize the basics of
following Christ - truth and love - and to warn against false
teachers.

## Author and Date

The second epistle of John was written by the
[apostle](Apostle "Apostle") [John](John "John") about the year 90
A.D. from the city of Ephesus in Asia Minor.



## Blueprint

The second epistle of John is the shortest book in the Bible at
only 13 verses long. Despite its brevity, it is generally divided
into two parts:

-   Watch out for false teachers (1-11)
-   Conclusion (12-13)

False teachers were a dangerous problem for the church to which
John was writing. His warning against showing hospitality to false
teachers may sound harsh and unloving to many today, yet these men
were teaching heresy that could seriously harm many believers - for
eternity. Note that John does not mean that Christians should treat
false teachers as subhuman or even that orthodox Christians should
never speak to wicked people - see
[1 Corinthians 5:10](1_Corinthians_5 "1 Corinthians 5"). Still,
Christians must maintain a careful distance from those who teach
heresies which can ruin the soul.

## Themes

Major themes contained in second John include the following:

-   **Truth** - Following God's Word, the Bible, is essential to
    Christian living because God is truth. Christ's true followers
    consistently obey his truth. In order to be loyal to Christ's
    teaching, we must seek to know the Bible, but we must never twist
    its message to our own needs or purposes or encourage others who
    misuse it.

-   **Love** - Christ's command is for Christians to love one
    another. This is the basic ingredient of true Christianity. To obey
    Christ fully, we must believe his command to love others. Helping
    and giving to meet others' needs put love into practice.

-   **False Leaders** - We must be wary of religious leaders who
    deny or undermine Christ's teaching. We must not give them a
    platform to spread false teaching. Do not encourage those who are
    opposed to Christ. Politely remove yourself from association with
    false leaders. Be aware of what is being taught in your church.
