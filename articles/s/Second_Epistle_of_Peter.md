## Author and date

The second epistle of Peter is generally attributed to the
[apostle](Apostle "Apostle") [Peter](Peter "Peter") as the letter
opens with salutation "Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus
Christ," however there are some questions concerning the
authenticity of this claim. Second Peter is thought to have been
written about the year 67 A.D. possibly from Rome.

### Arguments for Petrine authorship

-   The letter claims to be written by [Peter](Peter "Peter").

### Arguments for pseudonymnity

1.  There are major differences with [1 Peter](1_Peter "1 Peter").
2.  This letter was acknowledged as
    [pseudepigrapha](Pseudepigrapha "Pseudepigrapha").
3.  There is literary dependence on Jude (indicates late date).
4.  The reference to Paul's letters as Scripture (indicative of the
    second century).
5.  There was difficulty in acceptance of 2 Peter to the canon.

### Rejoinders to arguments for Petrine authorship

1.  The letter is not long enough to consider style issues.

## Blueprint

The second epistle of Peter is generally divided into three
sections:

-   Guidance for growing Christians (1:1-21)
-   Danger to growing Christians (2:1-22)
-   Hope for growing Christians (3:1-18)

While Peter wrote his first letter to teach about handling
persecution (trials from without), he wrote this letter to teach
about handling heresy (trials from within). False teachers are
often subtly deceitful. Believers today must still be vigilant
against falling into false doctrine, heresy, and cult activity.
This letter gives us clues to help detect false teaching.

## Themes

Major themes contained within second Peter include:

-   **Diligence** - If our faith is real, it will be evident in our
    faithful behaviour. If people are diligent in Christian growth,
    they won't backslide or be deceived by false teachers. Growth is
    essential. It begins with faith and culminates in love for others.
    To keep growing we need to know God, keep on following him, and
    remember what he taught us. We must remain diligent in faithful
    obedience and Christian growth.

-   **False Teachers** - Peter warns the church to beware of false
    teachers. These teachers were proud of their position, promoted
    sexual sin, and advised against keeping the
    [Ten Commandments](Ten_Commandments "Ten Commandments"). Peter
    countered them by pointing to the Spirit-inspired Scriptures as our
    authority. Christians need discernment to be able to resist false
    teachers. God can rescue us from their lies if we stay true to his
    Word, the Bible, and reject those who distort the truth.

-   **Christ's Return** - One day Christ will create a new heaven
    and earth where we will live forever. As Christians, our hope is in
    this promise. But with Christ's return comes his judgement on all
    who refuse to believe. The cure for complacency, lawlessness, and
    heresy is found in the confident assurance that Christ will return.
    God is still giving unbelievers time to repent. To be ready,
    Christians must keep on trusting and resist the pressure to give up
    waiting for Christ's return.
