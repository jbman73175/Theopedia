## Overview

In this epistle Paul entreats Timothy to come to him before winter,
and to bring Mark with him (compare Phil. 2:22). He was
anticipating that "the time of his departure was at hand" (2
Timothy 4:6), and he exhorts his "son Timothy" to all diligence and
steadfastness in the face of false teachings, with advice about
combatting them with reference to the teachings of the past, and to
patience under persecution (2 Timothy 1:6-15), and to a faithful
discharge of all the duties of his office (2 Timothy 4:1-5), with
all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge
of the quick and the dead.
