## Background

Shortly after writing his first letter to the Corinthians,
[Paul](Paul "Paul") left
[Ephesus](index.php?title=Ephesus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ephesus (page does not exist)"),
where intense excitement had been aroused against him, the evidence
of his great success, and proceeded to Macedonia. Pursuing the
usual route, he reached Troas, the port of departure for Europe.
Here he expected to meet with Titus, whom he had sent from Ephesus
to
[Corinth](index.php?title=Corinth&action=edit&redlink=1 "Corinth (page does not exist)"),
with news of the effects produced on the church there by the first
epistle; but was disappointed (1 Corinthians 16:9; 2 Corinthians
1:8; 2:12, 13). He then left Troas and proceeded to
[Macedonia](index.php?title=Macedonia&action=edit&redlink=1 "Macedonia (page does not exist)");
and at
[Philippi](index.php?title=Philippi&action=edit&redlink=1 "Philippi (page does not exist)"),
where he delayed, he was soon joined by Titus (2 Corinthians 7:6,
7), who brought him good news from Corinth, and also by
[Timothy](index.php?title=Timothy&action=edit&redlink=1 "Timothy (page does not exist)").
Under the influence of the feelings awakened in his mind by the
favourable report which
[Titus](index.php?title=Titus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Titus (page does not exist)")
brought back from Corinth, this second epistle was written. It was
probably written at Philippi, or, as some think, Thessalonica,
early in the year AD 58, and was sent to Corinth by Titus. This
letter he addresses not only to the church in Corinth, but also "to
the saints which are in all Achaia", i.e., the Roman province of
Achaea.

## Content

\1. Paul speaks of his spiritual labours and course of life, and
 expresses his warm affection toward the Corinthians (chapters
 1-7).

\2. He gives specific directions regarding the collection that was
 to be made for their poor brethren in Judea (8, 9).

\3. He defends his own apostolic claim (10-13), and justifies
 himself from the charges and insinuations of the false teacher and
 his adherents.
