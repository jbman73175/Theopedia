The **seeker sensitive model** refers to a modern approach to
public worship and evangelism whereby a church service is
structured in a way that is sensitive to seekers (i.e. those
interested or curious about church). In other words, church
services are designed to appeal to the unchurched, non-Christian,
in an attempt to draw them into the church community where they
might receive the gospel and be converted. This approach (or model)
has become popular in an increasing number of American churches,
perhaps most notably the Willow Creek Community Church and the
Saddleback Valley Community Church. Seeker sensitive proponents
include
[Bill Hybels](index.php?title=Bill_Hybels&action=edit&redlink=1 "Bill Hybels (page does not exist)")
and [Rick Warren](Rick_Warren "Rick Warren").

This philosophy is directly related to the so-called
"[Church growth movement](Church_growth_movement "Church growth movement")"
and secular ideas on "how to market the church to the world around
us."
