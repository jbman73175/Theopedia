"The Scriptures allude to the fact that God does not need anything
that we humans need to survive. He requires no water, air, food,
sleep or money. Counselors, supervisors, and advisors of any kind
are of no need to Him. He is self sufficient in all capacities this
is hard for the human brain to consider, that someone does not need
what we do to survive."

"If I were hungry I would not tell you, For the world is Mine, and
all it contains. Shall I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood
of male goats?" -Psalm 50:12-13

> Thou wast, O God, and thou was blest  
> Before the world begun;  
> Of thine eternity possest  
> Before time’s glass did run.  
> Thou needest none thy praise to sing,  
> As if thy joy could fade:  
> Couldst thou have needed any thing,  
> Thou couldst have nothing made.
