**Semi-Pelagianism**, a moderated form of
[Pelagianism](Pelagianism "Pelagianism"), taught that man has
retained the ability to seek [God](God "God") in and of himself
apart from any movement of God's grace. Pelagianism denied any real
effect of [original sin](Original_sin "Original sin") on human
nature. Semi-Pelagianism, admitted that man's nature was "injured"
by original sin, but maintained that man still has *free will* and
the *ability* to cooperate with God's grace in the
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") process.

The word appears to have been coined between 1590 and 1600 in
connection with [Molina](Molinism "Molinism")'s doctrine of grace,
in which opponents believed they saw a close resemblance to the
heresy of the monks of Southern Gaul at Marseille in the fifth
century, which they termed *Semi-Pelagianism*. This Semi-Pelagian
teaching, which aimed at a compromise between Pelagianism and
Augustinianism, was condemned as [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") at the
second [Council of Orange](Council_of_Orange "Council of Orange")
in A.D. 529 after disputes extending over more than a hundred
years.

In more recent times the word is frequently used by those in the
Reformed Protestant camp to designate anyone who deviates from the
Augustinian or Reformed Theology view of
[total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity"), such as
[Arminians](Arminianism "Arminianism").

## Discussion

Although the church generally agreed that
[Pelagius'](Pelagianism "Pelagianism") teachings were not correct,
[Augustine's](Augustine "Augustine") teachings were not universally
accepted either. Whereas Pelagius was condemned for being too
positive in his views concerning human nature, Augustine was said
by some to be too negative.

Vitalis of Carthage and a community of monks at Hadrumetum, Africa
(about 427 A.D.), contested some of Augustine's principles,
asserting that they destroyed freedom of the will and all moral
responsibility. The issue became heated in the fifth century when
some monks in southern Gaul, led by John Cassian, joined in the
controversy. These men objected to a number of points in the
Augustinian doctrine of sin and grace, namely, the assertion of the
total bondage of the will, of the priority and irresistibility of
grace, and of rigid predestination. Hence a compromise was sought,
leading to what later became known as "Semi-Pelagianism." On three
primary points of issue, Semi-Pelagianism settled for the following
positions:

-   **Human nature** is neither good nor bad, but injured. Just as
    an injured person can't quite do whatever he'd like to do, so
    likewise because of original sin, man's moral abilities became
    restricted. His free will remained, but was weakened by the Fall.
    Man, then, can still decide to seek and receive help.

-   **Man's need for grace:** Although Semi-Pelagianism believes in
    man's need for God's grace (for man is too weak to help himself),
    man by his own free will is able to decide whether he wants God's
    grace. Whereas Pelagius taught that salvation is totally man's own
    doing, and Augustine taught that salvation is totally from God,
    Semi-Pelagianism teaches that salvation is a combination of the
    efforts of both man and God. According to Semi-Pelagianism,
    salvation is accomplished when man decides to co-operate with God
    and accepts the grace God offers him. This is often viewed as a
    [synergistic](Synergism "Synergism") concept of salvation.

-   **God's sovereignty:** Semi-Pelagianism essentially maintains
    that the sovereignty of God is limited by man's decision to
    co-operate with God or not. God's gospel of salvation in Christ can
    be rejected by man and so return to God empty. Though God may wish
    to save someone, He can only do so if that person chooses to accept
    it and cooperate with grace.

Over the course of time, Semi-Pelagian doctrine (although couched
in terms of grace) became the dominant theological perspective of
the [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") Church, and
essentially remains so today.
