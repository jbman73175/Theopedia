The **Septuagint (LXX)** is the name commonly given in the West to
the oldest [Greek](Greek "Greek") translation of the Hebrew Bible
([Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament")). It is an
important source for biblical studies (Old and New Testament), to
make a distinctive contribution to the history of biblical
interpretation, and to be of considerable interest for the
understanding of the early development of both Judaism and
Christianity.^[[1]](#note-Dines)^

## Derivation

The Septuagint, the Greek Bible, represents the first known attempt
to translate the Hebrew Scriptures into an Indo-European language.
Its name is derived from the Latin *septuāgintā* meaning "The
Seventy," hence the abbreviation **LXX.** "The Seventy" originates
from a legendary account in the *Letter of Aristeas* of how
seventy-two Jewish scholars (six scribes from each of the twelve
tribes) were asked by the Egyptian pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus
in the 3rd century BC to translate the Torah for inclusion in the
Library of Alexandria. The names "Septuagint" and "LXX" are of
later Latin origin and are not used in Greek. The usual
[Greek](Greek "Greek") name for the translation is
*kata tous ebdomekonta* meaning "according to the seventy." From
the second century AD onward, the Greek Septuagint itself needed to
be translated for readers who did not know Greek. The earliest of
these translations are the Old Latin version from North Africa and
Italy, and the Coptic versions from Egypt.^[[1]](#note-Dines)^

## Contents

The Septuagint consists of Greek versions of all the books of the
Hebrew Scriptures (the Jewish *Tanakh* and the Christian
*Old Testament*) and a number of Greek apocryphal (or
deuterocanonical) works: the additions to Esther, Jeremiah and
Daniel, 1-4 Maccabees, Tobit, Judith, I Esdras, Wisdom, Sirach and
the Psalms of Solomon. These apocryphal and pseudepigraphical
books, although Jewish in origin, owe their survival to their
preservation in Christian biblical manuscripts—to their inclusion
in the Septuagint. When the earliest Jewish sources refer to the
Greek translations, they apparently mean only the five books
attributed to Moses. Christian authors, however, from Justin in the
second century AD and onwards, refer to the work of the Seventy as
covering any or all of the books of the Bible in Greek which were
accepted by Christians. The earliest comprehensive manuscripts,
from the fourth and fifth centuries AD, indicate that the
Septuagint embraces all of the books of the Hebrew
canon.^[[1]](#note-Dines)^

## Dating and critical scholarship

Modern scholarship holds that the LXX was translated and composed
over the course of the 3rd through 1st centuries BC, beginning with
the Torah. The oldest manuscripts of the LXX include 2nd century BC
fragments of Leviticus and Deuteronomy and first century BC
fragments of [Genesis](Genesis "Genesis"),
[Exodus](Book_of_Exodus "Book of Exodus"),
[Leviticus](Book_of_Leviticus "Book of Leviticus"),
[Numbers](Book_of_Numbers "Book of Numbers"),
[Deuteronomy](Book_of_Deuteronomy "Book of Deuteronomy"), and the
Minor Prophets. Relatively complete manuscripts of the LXX include
the *Codex Vaticanus* and the *Codex Sinaiticus* of the 4th century
AD and the *Codex Alexandrinus* of the 5th century. These are the
oldest surviving nearly-complete manuscripts of the Old Testament
in any language; the oldest extant complete Hebrew texts date from
around 1000 AD.^[[2]](#note-Wurth)^

The sources of the many differences between the Septuagint and the
[Masoretic text](Masoretic_text "Masoretic text") have long been
debated by scholars. One extreme view was that the Septuagint
provides a reasonably accurate record of an early Hebrew textual
variant, now lost, that differed from the Masoretic text. The other
extreme, favored by Jewish religious scholars, was that the
differences were primarily due to intentional or accidental
corruption of the Septuagint since its original translation from
the Masoretic text. Modern scholars follow a path between these two
views. Origen, a Christian theologian in Alexandria, completed a
comprehensive synopsis of each ancient version side-by-side, but
his work is now almost completely lost.

## Use of the Septuagint

### Jewish use

The Septuagint made it possible for Jews who had migrated from the
Greek homelands (Greek diaspora) to read their Holy Scriptures in
their own familiar language. It also provided an opportunity for
non-Jews to study the Old Testament (cf. Acts
8:26).^[[2]](#note-Wurth)^^p.54^ Jewish attitudes toward
translations of their scriptures developed with time. By the 2nd
century BC, it was often necessary for the readings in the
synagogues to be interpreted from Hebrew into Aramaic, producing
the need for the targumim, though one Talmud writer forbids their
use except for foreigners. A later Talmudic injunction by Rabbi
Simon ben Gamaliel said that Greek was the only language into which
the Torah could be accurately translated. The Septuagint found
widespread use in the Hellenistic world, even in Jerusalem, which
had become a rather cosmopolitan city. Both Philo and
[Josephus](Josephus "Josephus") show the influence of the
Septuagint in their citations of scripture, though both modified
passages that did not agree with the Hebrew text.

Several factors finally led most Jews to abandon the LXX, including
the fact that Greek scribes were not subject to the same rigid
rules imposed on Hebrew scribes; that Christians favoured the LXX;
and the gradual decline of the Greek language among Jews after most
of them fled from the Greek-speaking Roman Empire into the
Aramaic-speaking Persian Empire when Jerusalem was destroyed by the
Romans. Instead, Hebrew/Aramaic manuscripts compiled by the
Masoretes, or authoritative Aramaic translations such as that of
Onkelos, of Rabbi Yonasan ben Uziel, and Targum Yerushalmi, were
preferred.

Ethiopian Jews are the only Jewish community today who accept the
Septuagint (minus Ecclesiasticus).

### Christian use

The Early Christian Church, however, continued to use the LXX,
since most of its earliest members were Greek-speaking and because
the Messianic passages most clearly pointed to Jesus as the Christ
in the Septuagint translation. When Jerome started preparation of
the Vulgate translation of the Bible into Latin, he started with
the Septuagint, checking it against the Hebrew
[Masoretic text](Masoretic_text "Masoretic text") for accuracy, but
ended up translating most of the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") afresh from the
Hebrew. (Jerome based his Psalms off of the Septuagint, however.)
However, all the other early Christian translations of the Old
Testament were done from the Septuagint with no regard to the
Hebrew text, which few of the translators understood.

The writers of the [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"),
also written in Greek, quoted from the Septuagint frequently,
though not exclusively, when relating prophesies and history from
the Old Testament. Even when Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Armenian and
other translations appeared, the Septuagint continued to be used by
the Greek-speaking portion of the Christian Church. The
[Eastern Orthodox Church](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church")
still prefers to use LXX as the basis for translating the Old
Testament into other languages, and the Greek Orthodox Church
(which has no need for translation) continues to use it in its
[liturgy](Liturgy "Liturgy") even today. Many modern
[Catholic](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism") translations of
the Bible, while using the Masoretic text as their basis, employ
the Septuagint to decide between different possible translations of
the Hebrew text whenever the latter is unclear, corrupt, or
ambiguous.

## Language of the Septuagint

The Greek of the Septuagint shows many Semiticisms, or idioms and
phrases based on Hebrew, and the grammatical phenomenon known as
"attraction" is common there. Some parts of it have been described
as "Hebrew in Greek words". However, other sections show an
ignorance of Hebrew idiom, so that the literal translation provided
makes little sense. The translation in the
[Pentateuch](Pentateuch "Pentateuch") is very close to the Hebrew,
while some other books, such as the
[book of Daniel](Book_of_Daniel "Book of Daniel") show influence
from the midrash. [Ecclesiastes](Ecclesiastes "Ecclesiastes") is
near over-literal, while [Isaiah](Book_of_Isaiah "Book of Isaiah")
is fairly loosely translated. This is cited as near-certain
evidence that the translation was in fact made by several different
translators.

The translators usually, but not always, employed one and the same
Greek word for one Hebrew word whenever it occurs. Thus the
Septuagint can be called a mostly concordant translation. However,
like in most translations of any literary work, often more than one
Hebrew word gets translated into one and the same Greek word,
removing some nuances from the text.
