The **Sermon on the Mount** is the title given to
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus")' sermon found in
[Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew") 5-7. A similar,
yet shorter version in [Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke")
6:20b-49 is sometimes called the
[Sermon on the Plain](index.php?title=Sermon_on_the_Plain&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sermon on the Plain (page does not exist)")
to distinguish its account from [Matthew's](Matthew "Matthew"). The
title "Sermon on the Mount" goes back to
[Augustine's](Augustine "Augustine") title he gave to his important
commentary on Matthew 5-7, ^[[1]](#note-0)^ yet Matthew 5-7 was not
generally given this title until around the sixteenth century.
