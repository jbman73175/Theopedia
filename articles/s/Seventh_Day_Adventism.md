**Seventh-day Adventism** is a Christian Protestant denomination
founded by Ellen White, whom adherents consider to have manifested
the gift of prophecy in her ministry and writings. The *Adventist*
in their name is a reference to the denomination's belief in the
nearness of the Second Coming of Christ, originally predicted by
William Miller to occur between March 21, 1843 and March 21, 1844.
[[1]](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/140/52.0.html) The
denomination, officially established in 1863, grew out of the
Millerite movement that condemned all the churches of the day as
[apostate](Apostate "Apostate") and warned Christians to come out
of them. Although formerly regarded as a cult, the modern consensus
seems to be that "...it is perfectly possible to be a Seventh-day
Adventist and be a true follower of Jesus Christ despite heterodox
concepts..."^[[1]](#note-0)^
