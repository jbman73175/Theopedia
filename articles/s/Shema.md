**Shema** (שׁמע
^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#8085](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=8085&version=nas)]*^)
literally means "listen up", taken from the first word of
Deuteronomy 6:4-9. The *Shema* is Israel's declaration of
independence (from other nations and dependence on God alone.) The
*Shema* contains several commandments which are held very close to
the hearts of Traditional Jews (and some "Messianic Jews") even to
this day.

Jesus Christ, in Matthew 22:36-38, responded to question of which
is the greatest commandment by reciting the *Shema*.



## Deuteronomy 6:4-9

> 4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.  
> 5 You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all
> your soul and with all your might.  
> 6 And these words that I command you today shall be on your
> heart.  
> 7 You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk
> of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way,
> and when you lie down, and when you rise.  
> 8 You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as
> frontlets between your eyes.  
> 9 You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your
> gates.
