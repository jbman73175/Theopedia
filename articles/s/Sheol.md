**Sheol**, is a Hebrew word in the Old Testament referring either
to the abode of the wicked or to the *grave* or *death*.

The KJV renders *sheol* as *hell* 31 times, *grave* 31 times, and
*pit* 3 times. "Thus Sheol can refer either specifically to the
abode of the wicked (cf. Ps. 9:17; 55:15), or generally to the
grave or death (cf. Isaiah 38:10; Hosea 13:14). It is even used of
the belly of the fish in Jonah 2:2, or of a deep pit in Numbers
16:30, 33. Scholars generally have a difficult time deciding when
to interpret as '[hell](Hell "Hell"),' which is why the newer
translations either transliterate the word (NASB â€™95, NRSV), or
translate it as grave, death, depths, destruction, or pit (NIV)."
