**Hermas**, or **Shepherd of Hermas** is an early Christian
document known to the
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers").
The
[Muratorian canon](index.php?title=Muratorian_canon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Muratorian canon (page does not exist)"),
a list of canonical books from about the 3rd century, says Hermas
was written by the brother of Pius, Bishop of Rome, around 140-154
AD. It was most likely written in Rome. Despite much speculation,
the author remains unknown.

Visions I-IV were composed during a threatened persecution,
probably under Trajan (the Clement of 8:3 could be Clement of
Rome). Vision V - Similitude VIII and Similitude X were written
perhaps by the same author to describe repentance to Christians who
were wavering. Similitude IX was written to unify the entire work
and to threaten those who had been disloyal. This last phase must
have occurred before Irenaeus (ca. 175). A preferred date would be
140. On the basis of this internal analysis multiple authorship
seems necessary (Giet 1963), though the work could have been
composed by one person over a long period of time (Joly 1958).
