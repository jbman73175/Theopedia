A *sign* in Scripture refers to an external act that points to an
internal change of heart.

Adherants of reformed theology believe that circumcision and
baptism are both signs and [seals](Seal "Seal") of the covenant of
grace.

Gen 17:11 
  ~ You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the
    covenant between me and you.

Here, Abraham undergoes circumcision, which is a sign: an external
act that points to God's covenant.

## Other signs

    the earth.

-   Ex 8:23, plagues a miraculous sign that there is a distinction
    between the Egyptians and the Hebrews.
