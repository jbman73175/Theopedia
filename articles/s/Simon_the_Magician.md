**Simon the Magician**, also called **Simon the Sorcerer** and
**Simon Magus**, heard
[Philip the Evangelist](Philip_the_Evangelist "Philip the Evangelist")
speak the Gospel in Samaria (see Acts 8:9-25). As a result, he was
[baptized](Baptism "Baptism") and began to follow Philip (Acts
8:13).

The apostles [Peter](Peter "Peter") and [John](John "John") were in
Jerusalem and, after receiving news that the Samaritans accepted
the
[Word of God](index.php?title=Word_of_God&action=edit&redlink=1 "Word of God (page does not exist)"),
joined Philip in Samaria. When Simon the Magician observed Peter
and John laying hands upon other believers, Simon offered money in
exchange for the supernatural ability of transmitting the Holy
Spirit (Acts 8:14-19). Peter then condemned Simon and rebuked him
so that he might repent (Acts 8:20-24).
