The **simplicity of God** means that the being of [God](God "God")
is "simple" and beyond composition. God is not complex in the sense
that he is made up of distinct properties or constituents, nor can
it be said that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit comprise three
parts of God. Also called *divine simplicity*, it forms a
significant corollary of both the unity and
[trinity](Trinity "Trinity") of God.

The doctrine of divine simplicity is associated with the classical
theism of Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas and their adherents, whereby
God is understood as radically unlike creatures in that he is
devoid of any complexity or composition, whether physical or
metaphysical. Some modern critics, such as
[Alvin Plantinga](Alvin_Plantinga "Alvin Plantinga"),^[[1]](#note-0)^
challenge the doctrine as being incoherent.^[[2]](#note-1)^

"[Emil Brunner](Emil_Brunner "Emil Brunner"), for example, comes
down especially hard on the entire concept, criticizing the general
trend of the Protestant Scholastics to ground their entire
systematic theological formulations in this idea of
*simplicitas Dei*, and arguing that the notion only arises 'if we
make the abstract idea of the Absolute the starting-point for our
thought. This is simply the undifferentiated Monas of Neo-Platonism
modified by Theism.' Again: 'Here [in speaking of simplicity], we
are not dealing with an Attribute of God at all, but with the fact
that the idea of the Absolute permits no differentiations.'
