"**Sin** is any lack of conformity, active or passive, to the moral
law of [God](God "God"). This may be a matter of act, of thought,
or of inner disposition or state."^[[1]](#note-0)^ The theological
term for the study if *sin* is *hamartiology* from the Greek
*hamartia* for sin, error, or missing the mark. The Apostle Paul
used the verb *hamartano* when he wrote, “For all have *sinned*,
and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).

R.C. Sproul writes,

"In the least transgression I set myself above the authority of
God, doing insult to His majesty, His holiness,and His sovereign
right to govern me. Sin is a revolutionary act in which the sinner
seeks to depose God from His throne. Sin is a presumption of
supreme arrogance in that the creature vaunts his own wisdom above
that of the Creator, challenges divine omnipotence with human
impotence, and seeks to usurp the rightful authority of the cosmic
Lord."^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Degrees and categories

Protestantism, writes [R.C. Sproul](R.C._Sproul "R.C. Sproul"),
"rejected the Roman Catholic scheme of mortal and venial
sin."^[[3]](#note-2)^ Rather than rejecting degrees and gradations
of sin, however, it maintained them. Sproul explains:

"Calvin, for example, argued that all sin is mortal in the sense
that it rightly deserves death, but that no sin is mortal in the
sense that it destroys justifying grace. Considerations other than
the degrees of sin were in review in the Protestant rejection of
the mortal and venial sin distinction. Historic Protestantism
retained the distinction between ordinary sins and sins that are
deemed gross and heinous.
"The most obvious reason for the Protestant retention of degrees of
sin is that the Bible abounds with such gradations. The Old
Testament law had clear distinctions and provisions of penalty for
different levels of criminal acts. Some sins were punishable by
death, others by corporal penalties, and still others by the
levying of fines. In the Jewish criminal system, distinctions were
made between types of murder that would correspond to modern-day
distinctions such as first- and second-degree murder, and voluntary
and involuntary manslaughter."
