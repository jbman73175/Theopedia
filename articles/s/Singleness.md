**Singleness** simply refers to being unmarried, but is often used
interchangeably with the term, celibacy. Some singles are called
with a special and purposeful gifting by God to remain single for
the advancement of the "kingdom of heaven."^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Notes

1.  [↑](#ref-0) Matthew 19:12
2.  [↑](#ref-1)
    [Manasseh](index.php?title=Manasseh&action=edit&redlink=1 "Manasseh (page does not exist)")
    seems to be Hezekiah's only biblically-recorded son (cf. 2
    Chronicles 32:33), but it doesn't seem likely that he was one of
    the eunuchs because he succeeded Hezekiah as king after him.
    Manasseh is also said to have sons in several places.
3.  ↑ ^[3.0](#ref-ESVSpelling_0)^ ^[3.1](#ref-ESVSpelling_1)^
    ^[3.2](#ref-ESVSpelling_2)^ ^[3.3](#ref-ESVSpelling_3)^
    ^[3.4](#ref-ESVSpelling_4)^ ^[3.5](#ref-ESVSpelling_5)^ These names
    are using the spellings of the ESV.
4.  [↑](#ref-2) This would be supported by the fact that Harbona,
    one of the seven in chapter 1, is mentioned again in Esther 7:9 as
    "attending" the king, and these "young men" are also said to be
    "attending" the king.
5.  [↑](#ref-3) Bigthan may be the *Bigtha* of chapter 1.
