The **Sinlessness of Jesus** is clearly taught in the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"). In
[Hebrews](Epistle_to_the_Hebrews "Epistle to the Hebrews") we read
that [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") "has been tempted in every way, just as
we are - yet was without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). He is also described
as "a high priest [who] meets our need - one who is holy,
blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens"
(Hebrews 7:26) and is "unblemished" (Hebrews 9:14). Even
[Peter](Peter "Peter"), who knew Jesus well, declared that he
"committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth" (1 Peter
2:22). The apostle John tells us that "In him is no sin" (1 John
3:5) and Paul confirms for us that Jesus "had no sin" (2
Corinthians 5:21). Even Jesus himself asked those around him, "Can
any of you prove me guilty of sin?" (John 8:46).


## Sinless yet human

One problem arises from a study of the sinlessness of Jesus. Some
have asked, "If Jesus never sinned, was he truly human?" Wayne
Grudem writes:

"The key to understanding the duality of Christ's human nature and
His sinlessness is understanding that sin, as part of the human
condition, is **not** the normal condition. God did not create us
as sinners, but as a result of the fall, sin has marred our lives.
Christ's sinlessness is made clear in Scripture, from His 40 days
in the desert, where Satan tempted Christ but failed to entice him
in to sin, to the time of the beginning of His ministry where "the
favor of God was upon Him" (Luke 2:40)." - *Systematic Theology*,
