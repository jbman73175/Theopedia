"In the first century, slaves were not distinguishable from free
persons by race, by speech or by clothing; they were sometimes more
highly educated than their owners and held responsible professional
positions; some persons sold themselves into slavery for economic
or social advantage; they could reasonably hope to be emancipated
after ten to twenty years of service or by their thirties at the
latest; they were not denied the right of public assembly and were
not socially segregated (at least in the cities); they could
accumulate savings to buy their freedom; their natural inferiority
was not assumed." â€”Murray Harris,
