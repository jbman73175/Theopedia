The **Social Gospel** refers to the emphasis of a primarily
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") movement in the late 19th
century and early 20th century, to apply Christian principles to
social problems.

Being part of the "[modernism](Modernism "Modernism")" trend with a
strong emphasis on social justice, the movement is a rival to
evangelical and fundamentalist
[Christianity](Christianity "Christianity"). Members of the
movement see it as a return to the beginning of Christianity, that
is to the message of Jesus.

In the United States, prior to World War I, the Social Gospel was
the religious wing of the progressive movement which had the aim of
combating injustice, suffering, and poverty in society. In this
context, it is seen as having provided the philosophical
underpinning for the New Deal. After the war, the movement shifted
its focus to the civil rights arena, and later, became outspoken in
its opposition to the Vietnam War.

With the ascendancy of the "Christian right" beginning in the
1980s, the Social Gospel agenda declined in the United States, but
examples of its continued existence can still be found, notably the
organization known as the Call to Renewal.

Sometimes seen as a branch of Christian socialism, the Social
Gospel movement was especially influential in Canada and led many
ministers to become active in the socialist movement in the form of
the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and later the New
Democratic Party. It was reflected in the novel *In His Steps* that
was written by the Congregational minister
[Charles Sheldon](index.php?title=Charles_Sheldon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Charles Sheldon (page does not exist)"),
who coined the motto "What would Jesus do?" Sheldon was committed
to Christian Socialism and identified with the Social Gospel. One
of the early theologians of the Social Gospel was
[Walter Rauschenbusch](index.php?title=Walter_Rauschenbusch&action=edit&redlink=1 "Walter Rauschenbusch (page does not exist)"),
and he indicated how Sheldon's novel inspired his theology. Social
Gospel is still influential in Canada's
[United Church](index.php?title=United_Church&action=edit&redlink=1 "United Church (page does not exist)")
and in the [Anglican Church](Anglican_Church "Anglican Church") but
has less influence in the United States. It also remains
influential among Christian socialist circles in Britain in the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England"),
[Methodist](Methodist "Methodist"), and some
[Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism") movements.

Both [Catholicism](Catholicism "Catholicism") and
[Liberation theology](Liberation_theology "Liberation theology")
both have similarities to the Social Gospel. In the Anglican
Church, the Social Gospel has found expression in
[pacifism](index.php?title=Pacifism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pacifism (page does not exist)").
