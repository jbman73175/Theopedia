**Socinianism** is a version of the old
[Arian](Arianism "Arianism") anti-trinitarian
[heresy](Heresy "Heresy") named after Fausto Sozzini (or Socinus,
1539-1604), a product of the radical skepticism of the Italian
Renaissance. Socinianism denies the full deity of Christ,
predestination, original sin, total inability (of man to convert
himself), the atonement as a penal satisfaction, and justification
by faith alone.

The Socinian attacks on the substitutionary and propitiatory nature
of the atonement were strongly opposed by 16th century jurist
[Hugo Grotius](Hugo_Grotius "Hugo Grotius"), who, in response to
the Socinians, developed what has become known as the
[Governmental theory of atonement](Governmental_theory_of_atonement "Governmental theory of atonement").

Forms of Socinianism continue today in the Unitarians and the
[Jehovah's Witnesses](Jehovah's_Witnesses "Jehovah's Witnesses").
