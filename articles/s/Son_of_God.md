**Son of God** is a title applied uniquely to
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") and in various ways to other people, even
nations (e.g., Israel). Used by virtually every author of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), the title "is
arguably the most significant christological title... 'Son of God'
or its equivalents ('the Son,' or 'my Son,' etc.) occur more than
124 times in the NT..." ^[[1]](#note-0)^. The title, one that is
applied by Jesus to himself (e.g., Mark 13:32) and by others as
well (e.g. John 20:31), points to a special intimacy between Jesus
and [God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father").

"Though the title 'Son of God' can sometimes be used simply to
refer to Israel (Matt. 2:15), or to man as created by God (Luke
2:38), or to redeemed man generally (Rom. 8:14, 19, 23), there are
nevertheless instances in which the phrase 'Son of God' refers to
Jesus as the heavenly, eternal Son who is equal to God himself (see
Matt. 11:25-30; 17:5; 1 Cor. 15:28; Heb. 1:1-3, 5, 8)." - Wayne
Grudem, *Systematic Theology*, 547.

"In the New Testament revelation and later in Christian theology,
'Son of God' came to have a higher significance; Jesus is the Son
of God because he is God and partakes of the divine nature." -
George Eldon Ladd, *A Theology of the New Testament*, 160.

"The phrase 'Son of God' (*huios theou*) it a title used of Jesus
to indicate that he is divine in nature, just as the title 'Son of
Man,' among other things, indicates that he is human." - Walter
Elwell, *Theological Dictionary of the Bible*, 411.

## Sonship in the NT

In the NT, Jesus is understood as *the* Son of God, while believers
are distinguished as "adopted" children of God (cf. Gal 4:5; Eph
1:5). For example, in the letter of [1 John](1_John "1 John"),
Jesus is designated as the Son while believers are simply called
children. Jesus' relationship is unique in comparison to that of a
believers.
