The phrase "**Son of Man**" is a title often applied by
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") to Himself. It is an allusion to Daniel
7:13-14, which reads:

"I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven
there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of
Days and was presented before him. And to him was given dominion
and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages
should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which
shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be
destroyed."
The allusion is clearest in Mark 14:61-62:

But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest
asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?" And Jesus
said, "I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right
hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."
The phrase to which Jesus alludes so frequently is, in the original
text of Daniel 7:13, *bar enash*, as opposed to the more usual
phrase *bar 'adam*. *Bar enash* carries the connotation of a
foremost heir to a throne. ^[[1]](#note-0)^ Therefore, it can be
seen as a strong claim to
[divinity](Deity_of_Jesus "Deity of Jesus").
