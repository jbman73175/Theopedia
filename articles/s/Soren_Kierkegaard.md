Søren Kierkegaard
**Søren Kierkegaard** (5 May, 1813 – 11 November, 1855), a 19th
century Danish philosopher and
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian"), is generally recognized as
the first [existentialist](Existentialism "Existentialism")
philosopher. He bridged the gap that existed between
[Hegelian](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel "wikipedia:Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel")
philosophy and what was to become Existentialism. Kierkegaard
strongly criticised both the Hegelian philosophy of his time, and
what he saw as the empty formalities of the Danish church. Much of
his work deals with religious problems such as the nature of faith,
the institution of the Christian Church, Christian ethics and
theology, and the emotions and feelings of individuals when faced
with existential choices. Because of this, Kierkegaard's work is
sometimes characterized as Christian existentialism and existential
psychology. Since he wrote most of his early work under various
pseudonyms, and often these pseudo-authors would comment on and
critique the works of his other pseudo-authors, it can be
exceedingly difficult to distinguish between what Kierkegaard truly
believed and what he was merely arguing for as part of a
pseudo-author's position.
[Ludwig Wittgenstein](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein "wikipedia:Ludwig Wittgenstein")
opined that Kierkegaard was "by far, the most profound thinker of
the nineteenth century".

## Theology of Kierkegaard

Søren Kierkegaard's theology has been a major influence in the
development of 20th century theology. Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855)
was a 19th century Danish philosopher who has been generally
considered the "Father of Existentialism". During his later years
(1848-1855), most of his writings shifted from being philosophical
in nature to being religious.

Kierkegaard's theology focuses on the single individual in relation
to an unprovable, yet known God. Much of his writings were a
directed assault against all of Christendom, Christianity as a
political and social entity. His target was the Danish State
Church, which represented Christendom in Denmark. Christendom, in
Kierkegaard's view, made individuals lazy in their religion. Many
of the citizens were officially "Christians", without having any
idea of what it means to be a Christian. Kierkegaard attempted to
awaken Christians to the need for unconditional religious
commitment.

Kierkegaard's primary religious audience was
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") Christian readers, especially
those who did not fully grasp what Christianity was all about. It
was not his intention to convert non-Christians to Christianity,
although much of Kierkegaard's religious writings do appeal to some
non-Christian readers. For example,
[Martin Buber](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Buber "wikipedia:Martin Buber")
was a Jewish existentialist theologian who critiqued much of
Kierkegaard's ideas.

### Christendom

Kierkegaard took up a sustained attack on all of
[Christendom](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom "wikipedia:Christendom"),
or Christianity as a political entity, during the final years of
his life. In the 19th century, most Danes who were citizens of
[Denmark](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark "wikipedia:Denmark")
were necessarily members of the
[Danish State Church](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Denmark "wikipedia:Church of Denmark").
Kierkegaard felt this state-church union was unacceptable and
perverted the true meaning of Christianity. The main points of the
attack include:

-   *Church congregations are meaningless*: The idea of
    congregations keeps individuals as children since Christians are
    disinclined from taking the initiative to take responsibility for
    their own relation to God. Kierkegaard stresses that "Christianity
    is the individual, here, the single individual."

-   *Christendom had become secularized and political*: Since the
    Church was controlled by the State, Kierkegaard believed the
    State's bureaucratic mission was to increase membership and oversee
    the welfare of its members. More members would mean more power for
    the clergymen: a corrupt ideal. This mission would seem at odds
    with Christianity's true doctrine, which is to stress the
    importance of the individual, not the whole.

-   *Christianity becomes an empty religion*: Thus, the state
    church political structure is offensive and detrimental to
    individuals, since everyone can become "Christian" without knowing
    what it means to be Christian. It is also detrimental to the
    religion itself since it reduces Christianity to a mere fashionable
    tradition adhered to by unbelieving "believers", a "herd mentality"
    of the population, so to speak.

Attacking the incompetence and corruption of the Christian
churches, Kierkegaard seemed to have anticipated philosophers who
would go on to criticize the Christian religion.
