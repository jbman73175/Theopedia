In religion and philosophy, the **soul** is "the immaterial aspect
or essence of a human being, that which confers individuality and
humanity, often considered to be synonymous with the mind or the
self. In theology, the soul is further defined as that part of the
individual which partakes of divinity and often is considered to
survive the death of the body."^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Soul vs Spirit

The soul and the spirit are the two primary immaterial aspects that
Scripture ascribes to humanity. It can be confusing to attempt to
discern the precise differences between the two. The word “spirit”
refers only to the immaterial facet of humanity. Human beings have
a spirit, but are we not spirits. The word “soul” can refer to both
the immaterial and material aspects of humanity. Unlike human
beings having a spirit, human beings are souls. In its most basic
sense, the word “soul” means “life.”^[[2]](#note-1)^ Specifically,
in Genesis 2:7, we see that God breathed the breath of life into
Adam, causing Adam to become a “living soul.”

## Creationism vs Traducianism

**Creationism** teaches that [God](God "God") directly creates all
souls individually at the time of conception.
[Traducianism](Traducianism "Traducianism") is the theory that a
soul is generated in the process of procreation by the physical
parents along with the body.

### Problems with the Creationism view

-   God is not the immediate cause of evil. So how can He be the
    direct creator of a sinful soul? Creationism seems to only work
    with a [Traducian](Traducianism "Traducianism") view of the sin
    nature.
-   Creationism makes God's work of creation continue past the
    Genesis sixth day where we are told that God ceased his creation
    activity.
