**Soul competency** is a [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine")
specifically articulated in a Southern Baptist context, first by
E.Y Mullins in *The Axioms of Religion* (1908). This view
emphasizes that each person (soul) is individually and personally
accountable to [God](God "God") and "competent" to relate to God
without mediation through other humans or human institutions. It
may be properly related to, but not the same as, the doctrine of
the
[Priesthood of all believers](Priesthood_of_all_believers "Priesthood of all believers").
One clue to the significance of *The Axioms of Religion* by Mullins
is found in the sub-title:
*a new interpretation of the Baptist faith*.

The effect of Mullins' emphasis on soul competency has been
criticized by some as planting the seeds of experientialism within
the
[Southern Baptist Convention](Southern_Baptist_Convention "Southern Baptist Convention"),
thus undermining the importance of its founding Baptist theology
and biblical doctrine.
