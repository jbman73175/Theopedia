The **Southern Baptist Convention** (SBC) is term referring to both
the denomination and its annual meeting of delegates, both at the
national level and local levels. The SBC is the largest Baptist
group, and the largest Protestant denomination in the United
States, claiming 16 million members. According to the
*Religious Congregations Membership Study*, the Convention had
15,922,039 members in 41,514 churches in the United States in
2000.

Because Baptist churches believe strongly in the autonomy of the
local church, the SBC is a cooperative organization by which
churches can pool resources, rather than as a body with any
administrative control over local churches. It maintains a central
administrative organization based in Nashville, Tennessee, which
has no authority over its affiliated state conventions, local
associations, or individual churches or members. Its "confession of
faith", the *Baptist Faith and Message* (2000 edition), is also not
binding on churches or members (see "SBC Beliefs" below).

## History

Baptists arrived in the southern United States near the end of the
17th century. The first Baptist church in the south was formed in
Charleston, South Carolina under the leadership of William Screven,
a Baptist preacher and shipbuilder who arrived there from Maine in
1696.

The first associations formed in the South were the Charleston
Association (org. 1751) and the Sandy Creek Association (org.
1758). Baptists in the South participated in forming the first
national Baptist organization in 1814 known as the Baptist Board of
Foreign Missions or the *Triennial Convention* which met every
three years.

The **Southern Baptist Convention** was formed May 8-12, 1845 in
Augusta, Georgia. Its first president was William Bullein Johnson
(1782-1862), who was president of the Triennial Convention in 1841.
The immediate, though not the only, cause for forming the SBC was
the controversy over slavery between Northerners and Southerners
within the Triennial Convention and the Home Mission Society.
Though the bodies were theoretically neutral, some Baptists in the
South did not believe the assurances of neutrality. They knew
several leaders were engaged in abolitionist activity. To test
this, Georgia Baptists recommended James E. Reeve, a slaveholder,
to the Home Mission Society as a missionary in the South. The
Society did not appoint Reeve, presumably not on the basis of his
being a slaveholder, but because the Georgia Baptists wished his
appointment specifically because he was a slaveholder. Baptists
from the South subsequently broke from this organization and formed
the new Southern Baptist convention.

Another issue that disturbed the churches in the south was the
perception that the American Baptist Home Mission Society (org.
1832) did not appoint a proportionate number of missionaries to the
southern region of the U. S.

It is also evident that Baptists north and south preferred a
different type of denominational organization: the Baptists in the
north as a whole preferred a loosely structured society composed of
individuals who paid annual dues, with each society usually focused
on a single ministry, while the southern churches preferred an
organization composed of churches patterned after their
associations, with a variety of ministries brought under the
direction of one denominational organization.

## SBC Beliefs

The general theological perspective of the churches of the Southern
Baptist Convention is represented in the
*Baptist Faith and Message* (BF&M). The BF&M was first drafted in
1925, then revised significantly in 1963 and again in 2000, with
the latter revision being the subject of much controversy.

The BF&M is not considered to be a creed along the lines of
historic Christian creeds such as the Nicene Creed; members are not
required to adhere to it nor are churches required to use it as
their "Statement of Faith" or "Statement of Doctrine" (though many
do in lieu of creating their own Statement). Despite the fact that
the BF&M is not a "creed," missionaries who apply to serve through
the various SBC missionary agencies must "affirm" that their
practices, doctrine, and preaching are consistent with the BF&M;
this affirmation has also been the subject of controversy. For
