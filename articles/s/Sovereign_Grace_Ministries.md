**Sovereign Grace Ministries** is a family of 68 churches in 23
states and 5 countries outside the US. The movement, which has its
origins in the early 1970s, focuses on the centrality of the cross,
a passion for starting, establishing, and strengthening local
churches with the gospel, and the essential truths of Reformed
theology, (such as justification by faith alone and Scripture alone
as the sole infallible,
[inerrant](Inerrancy_of_the_Bible "Inerrancy of the Bible") source
of authority), but does not hold other traditionally Reformed
doctrines (such as
[infant baptism](Infant_baptism "Infant baptism") and
[cessationism](Cessationism "Cessationism")).

One distinctive of the organization is that it writes and publishes
most of its own worship music, much of which is available for free
on their
[website](http://www.sovereigngraceministries.org/music/).
