The **Sovereignty of God** is the biblical teaching that all things
are under God's rule and control, and that nothing happens without
His direction or permission. [God](God "God") works not just some
things but all things according to the counsel of His own will (see
Eph. 1:11). His purposes are all-inclusive and never thwarted (see
Isa. 46:11); nothing takes Him by surprise. The sovereignty of God
is not merely that God has the power and right to govern all
things, but that He does so, always and without exception. In other
words, God is not merely sovereign *de jure* (in principle), but
sovereign *de facto* (in practice).

## Quotes

-   "What do we mean by [the sovereignty of God]? We mean the
    supremacy of God, the kingship of God, the god-hood of God. To say
    that God is Sovereign is to declare that God is God. To say that
    God is Sovereign is to declare that He is the Most High, doing
    according to His will in the army of Heaven, and among the
    inhabitants of the earth, so that none can stay His hand or say
    unto Him what doest Thou? (Dan. 4:35). To say that God is Sovereign
    is to declare that He is the Almighty, the Possessor of all power
    in Heaven and earth, so that none can defeat His counsels, thwart
    His purpose, or resist His will (Psa. 115:3). To say that God is
    Sovereign is to declare that He is "The Governor among the nations"
    (Psa. 22:28), setting up kingdoms, overthrowing empires, and
    determining the course of dynasties as pleaseth Him best. To say
    that God is Sovereign is to declare that He is the "Only Potentate,
    the King of kings, and Lord of lords" (1 Tim. 6:15). Such is the
    God of the Bible." (A. W. Pink, *The Sovereignty of God*, chap. 1)

## God's sovereignty in salvation

God's sovereignty in salvation means that He saves whom He will,
and those whom He saves owe nothing to anything in or of
themselves. They are saved because God graciously chose them in
eternity and regenerated and called them in history. They cannot
even take credit for their faith because it is the gift that He
Himself sovereignly bestows.
