**Speaking in tongues** is one of the manifestations of the
[Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") in 1 Corinthians 12:4-11. And
appears to be the same gift is in Acts 2:4 - "And they were all
filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other *tongues*
as the Spirit gave them utterance" (ESV). The understanding of this
gift differs greatly between
[Continuationists](Continuationism "Continuationism") and
[Cessationists](Cessationism "Cessationism"), and is the probably
most controversial issue separating the two camps.

Speaking in tongues is claimed to be is widely practiced today by
[Pentecostal](Pentecostalism "Pentecostalism") and
[Charismatic](Charismatic "Charismatic") churches. Cessationists on
the other hand reject that, and claim that such ecstatic utterances
are not the geniune gifts of tongues. They (cessationists) claim
that the gift of tongues refers only to known languages, and were
available only to the early church.

## Cessationist Understanding

The cessationist understanding of the gift of tongues, is that it
refers only to known languages (like Greek, Egyptian or Arabic),
and not ecstatic speaking. At Pentecost this gift allowed believers
to communicate with foreigners in their native languages (tongues)
which they did not previously know. These were clearly the existing
native languages of the foreigners. Continuatiuonists therefore,
who see the gift of tongues listed in 1 Corinthians 12:10 as an
ecstatic utterance rather than a known language, must therefore
distinguish what Paul is describing in 1 Corintians from the
*tongues* described in Acts 2.

### A Cessationist argument from 1 Corinthians

[Cessationism](Cessationism "Cessationism"), is the belief that
*speaking in tongues* as well as all the other miraculous and
supernatural gifts of the Apostolic era have ceased. This view
understands 1 Cor. 13:8 to categorically state that at some point
tongues will *cease* and that prophecy and knowledge will
*pass away*.
^[***[citations\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

There is much debate regarding the timing of the cessation of the
items mentioned in 1 Cor.13:8. In order to see when this occurred,
or when it is meant to occur, the word *remain* in 1 Cor. 13:13
needs to be examined in the light of its connection to the three
items in 1 Cor. 13:8 which are said to cease/fade/vanish when
*that which is perfect* is come.

#### Tongues, prophecy and knowledge will cease before Jesus returns

In 1 Cor. 13:13, faith, hope and love are said to remain. For the
word *remain* to make any grammatical sense, then something else
must first be removed. The things targeted to be removed are
mentioned a few verses back in 1 Cor. 13:8, namely tongues,
prophecy and knowledge. Even after these gifts are removed, faith,
hope and love will remain. Considering that the gift of faith (1
Cor. 12:9) will remain with mankind until Jesus returns, then the
items of 1 Cor. 13:8 must be gone before this time. As already
noted, something must go before something else can be said to
remain. It is not possible for the three gifts of 1 Cor. 13:8 to
remain along with our faith and hope because that would be saying
that the things targeted to cease will actually remain until the
things that remain cease. Logic dictates that the items in v.8 have
to be gone in order for the items in v.13 to be said to remain so
tongues, prophecy and knowledge must cease before Jesus'
return.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

#### Prophecy and knowledge have ceased because the Bible is completed

It can be noted that the coming of *that which is perfect* (1 Cor.
13:10) is only linked to the *in part* gifts of prophecy and
knowledge and not to any other gifts. The inspired writers of the
Bible were given these gifts of futuristic prophecy and special
knowledge. Futuristic prophecy, such as in the book of Revelation,
was given to these men to foretell the things which God wanted to
reveal to
man.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
Supernatural knowledge was needed to explain things like
redemption, Christian living, church guidelines etc. When 1
Corinthians was written, the Bible was incomplete ... it was
*in part*, and that is why prophecy and knowledge, in 1 Cor. 13:9,
were said to be *in part*. When the Bible was completed, this
special, revelatory prophecy and knowledge ceased because all the
future prophecy and special knowledge, which God wanted us to have,
was now contained in the Bible. The word *perfect* can be
translated *complete* or *finished* and these words well describe
our completed, *that which is perfect* Bible. With the completed
Bible, the *in part* gifts of supernatural prophecy and knowledge
were done away with and so today no one can add to the Bible.

##### Face to face

The term *face to face* in 1 Cor. 13:12 is sometimes interpreted as
seeing Jesus face to
face.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
However, reading on from the coming of perfection in v.10, we see
that v.11 speaks of leaving childish things behind and becoming
mature. If this maturing awaits Jesus' return then it means that
believers will remain babes in Christ, never reaching spiritual
maturity, until that time. Passages such as Jam. 1:23-25, Heb.
5:11-6:3 and Eph. 4:11-15 speak of a believer's growth and maturing
in Christ through the Word of God. In 1 Cor. 13:12 the writer
explains that *now*, before the perfect had come, they saw things
dimly but *then*, when the perfect had come, they would know fully.
Like v.11, this verse speaks of the growth from immaturity to
maturity. Today, with the completed Bible, a believer can mature in
Christ, see themselves clearly (come *face to face*), know
themselves as they are Divinely known and know God's full plan and
purpose.

##### The purpose of tongues

1 Cor. 14:22 says, “Tongues then ... are a sign for unbelievers”.
The word *then* indicates that this verse is referring to the
previous verse(s). 1 Cor. 14:21 says that God will speak to
*this people*. The New Testament term *this people* always refers
to the Jews so the unbelievers being referred to in 1 Cor. 14:22
(from Isa 28) were Jews and in Acts it can be noted that whenever
tongues was used Jews were present. So, the purpose of tongues was
to be a sign to unbelieving
Jews.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
One sign was to show that salvation was also for the Gentiles,
hence the foreign languages. The book of Acts shows that the Jews
did not believe and often fiercely resisted the fact that God's
salvation plan also included the Gentiles (Acts 11:1-18, 22:17-22).
Tongues was also a sign of judgment against the Jews. The quote in
1 Cor. 14:21-22 comes from Isaiah 28:11-13 where judgment was
pronounced against Israel (Their Temple was destroyed in 70AD).
With the completion of the Bible, speaking in tongues was no longer
necessary as it was clearly revealed in Scripture that the Gentiles
were part of God's plan of salvation. To sum up, tongues,
supernatural prophecy and knowledge were temporary gifts for
specific purposes and they were withdrawn when they had served
their purpose.

##### Mark 16:15-18

In Mark 16:15-18, Jesus said that tongues would be one of the signs
that followed the evangelists as they went into the world. This was
fulfilled, as Acts shows. About 20 years after Jesus said this, 1
Corinthians was written stating that tongues would cease and this
occurred some 40 years later, when the Bible was
completed.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
1 Cor. 14 has many rules governing the use of tongues and these
rules applied to the church before the gift was withdrawn. The
rules were put in place because of the abuse of the gift and had no
bearing on the fact that tongues, being just a sign, was to cease
at a later stage when the completed Bible made it clear to the Jews
that the Gentiles were part of God's salvation plan.

##### 1 Cor. 14:39

In 1 Cor. 14:39 Paul said “do not forbid speaking in tongues”
because at that point in time speaking in tongues was still a gift
and was to remain so for some 40 more years. He also said in 1 Cor.
14:18 that he spoke in tongues more than anyone. This is because he
was on the front-line of evangelism. He travelled widely doing the
pioneering work for the Gospel and always went to the Jews first,
the very people the sign was for. With this in mind it is easy to
see why he spoke in tongues more than anyone else. In 1 Cor. 14:5
he said that he wished all spoke in tongues. Two possible reasons
for his saying this are 1) more individuals would be evangelising
the Jews and 2) it was edifying to be used of God in such a manner
and he wished this edification on others.

## Continuationist position

[Continuationism](Continuationism "Continuationism") is the belief
that miraculous gifts have not ceased (1 Cor. 1:7, Acts 2:16-18),
and is normative for those who believe and seek (James 5:17-18,
Mark 11:22-24, Matt 7:7-11), just as it is taught and shown
throughout the bible (2 Tim 3:16-17). Continuationists believe
that :

1.  Christians should desire the gift of tongues (1 Cor 14:5, 15)
2.  Christians should not forbid speaking in tongues (1 Cor
    14:39-40)
3.  the gift of tongues is valuable in personal worship and
    edification (1 Cor 14:4, 15)
4.  the utterance of the gift tongues can be languages of men or of
    angels (1 Cor.
    13:1)^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
5.  the utterance of the gift tongues is not understandable to the
    one speaking it (1 Cor 14:13-14) - (unless he/she has the gift of
    interpretation at the time)

In addition, Pentecostals believe that the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit is evidenced by it (Acts 10:45-46, Acts 2:4, Acts
19:5-6).^[[1]](#note-0)^

### Arguments for the gift of tongues

#### Cessationism is not taught in the Bible

Cessationists use Eph 2:20 :

"having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
Christ Jesus Himself being the corner {stone,}" (NASB)
... to say that supernatural gifts have ceased ^[[2]](#note-1)^.
They that once the foundation of a building is laid, there is no
need to add to it. Then they say that the "foundation of the
apostles and prophets" refers to the bible. Then they say that the
purpose of the gift of prophecy was only to enable bible writers to
write the bible and give confirmation of it. So they conclude that
the gift of prophecy must have ceased (the bible being completed).
Then they say that the gift of tongues along with the gift of
interpretation, enables revelation from God (just like prophecy) so
therefore the gift of tongues must have ceased also (otherwise the
bible would be growing).^[[3]](#note-2)^

But the context of Eph 2:20 is that Paul was talking about Jews and
Gentiles being reconciled in Christ and not about spiritual gifts.
Paul simply using a temple analogy to show that the Jews and
Gentiles are reconciled and have the same
foundation.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
He is not saying at all, that the spiritual gifts will cease when
the N.T. is complete. Also, if the foundation refered to is the
completed New Testament (of which Paul has no idea of), then his
argument fails because the foundation is not there yet. The point
of an analogy depends on the context that it is used. It is not
hermeneutically sound to put various interpretations on parts of an
analogy independent from the context that it is being used. (e.g.
Just like some early Church fathers put various interpretation on
parts of the parable of the Good Samaritan).

Also, there is no direct relationship between the revelatory gifts
and the inspiration of the bible. Not all the biblical writers had
the gift of prophecy (e.g. Mark who only recorded Peter and even
adds his own comment-Mark 13:14, Luke who only investigated, the
compiler of Jeremiah, those who recorded Moses death in the
Pentateuch, Tertius who wrote Romans for Paul "in the Lord" (see
Greek order) and adds his own greetings- Rom 16:22, etc.) even
though what they wrote was the Word of God. And not all prophecies
of all genuine prophets were included in the bible, not in the
O.T., not in the N.T. In fact, not all of Paul's letters and
sermons were included in the Bible, only a few and yet the bible is
not incomplete but complete. Of the apostles in the N.T., only a
few made contributions to the Bible (Paul, Peter, John, James,
Matthew). Philip's four prophesying daughters made no made no
contribution at all, nor did Agabus (Luke records him, but he did
not write anything that was included). No one from the Corinthian
church of whom Paul commanded to desire the gift of prophecy made
any contribution. No one who spoke in tongues in Corinth and then
translated, made its way to the bible. In fact Paul who boasts that
he spoke in tongues more than any of the Corinthians, doesn't have
a single untterance in tongues that was translated and added to the
bible. Nor of the 120 disciples who spoke in tongues at Pentecost.
To say that if someone genuinely speaks in tongues, then he is
adding to scriptures is not biblical at all.

#### Spiritual gifts are here to stay until Jesus returns

##### 1 Cor. 13:8-13

"Love never fails; but if {there are gifts of} prophecy, they will
be done away; if {there are} tongues, they will cease; if {there
is} knowledge, it will be done away. For we know in part and we
prophesy in part; but when the perfect comes, the partial will be
done away. When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think
like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away
with childish things. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then
face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully just
as I also have been fully known. But now faith, hope, love, abide
these three; but the greatest of these is love." (NASB)
Cessationist claim that "when the perfect comes" refers to the
completion of the N.T. scriptures, and "partial" or "know in part"
or "prophesy in part" refers to their time because the N.T. is not
yet completed (thus they don't have the complete
revelation).^[[4]](#note-3)^ When the scripture is complete, the
childish things are to be done away with (like gifts of prophecy,
tongues) because one can study the bible and be mature.

However that argument doesn't work. For one thing, when the N.T.
scriptures were completed, very very few people had copies of it,
and of those who had copies, most have only parts of it. It was not
until the invention of the printing press during the reformation
(approx. 1500 years later) that whole accurate copies of the bible
were made available to the middle class in Europe. And even today,
millions of Christians don't have a copy of the bible that they can
understand (assuming they can read).

Also, even when a Christian has a copy of a complete accurate
bible, no can claim to understand it 100%. The very fact that
cessationist claim that continuationists (who make up the vast
majority of bible-believing born again
Christians)^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
are wrong, point to the fact that the bible is not easy to
understand. In fact even the apostle Peter found some of Paul's
writings hard to understand (2 Pet.3:16). To say that because some
Christians have the bible today, therefore we know fully just as we
are fully known (by God) is not true. To claim that Christians
today fully know, even more than Paul who claims to only know in
part (even when had personally spoken with the Lord Jesus, and had
been taken up to paradise, having heard inexpressible words which a
he is not permitted to tell) is just obviously not true.

Also the claim by Cessationionist that because the gift of faith
will remain until Jesus returns, therefore the gift of prophecy/
knowledge/ tongues must cease before Jesus returns, is not a
logical
statement.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
In fact the statement "faith will remain until Jesus returns" (the
way it is used in the argument) is directly contrary to the
statement "faith will remain forever" (along with love and hope).
Also, the gift of faith in 1 Cor.12:9 (whom some Christians have)
and 1 Cor. 13:13 (whom all Christians have) are not the same
thing.

1 Cor. 13:8-13 more naturally therefore refers to the time when
Jesus returns, when all believers recieve the ressurection body
(the perfect state) and have intimate fellowship with Jesus Christ
(see face to face/ know fully).^[[5]](#note-4)^ A time when even
Paul's mighty gift of prophecy and knowledge will be no longer
needed. A parallel is found in 1 John 3:2 :

"Beloved, now we are children of God, and
*it has not appeared as yet what we will be*. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we *will* see Him just as He
is." (NASB)
Christians will see Jesus just as He is, when He appears and not
earlier. Christians today necessarily do not know in full, with or
without the bible, the apostle John plainly says so.

Therefore if the gift of tongues will cease when Jesus returns,
then they must be available today.

#### The Bible commands not to forbid the speaking in tongues

Jesus said in Mark 16:15-18 ^[[6]](#note-5)^ that the sign of
tongues would follow the evangelists as they preached the Gospel.
The Gospel is still being preached throughout the world and nowhere
does the Bible say that the gift will cease before Jesus returns.
Also, in 1 Cor. 14:1 we are told to earnestly desire spiritual
gifts and 1 Cor 14:29 tells us that speaking in tongues should not
be forbidden so it is obvious that tongues is still a gift today.
To add to this, we are told that speaking in tongues would edify
the believer (1 Cor. 14:4) and that we should pray in the Spirit on
all occasions (Eph. 6:18).

    Cessationists also closely associate the gift of tongues with the
