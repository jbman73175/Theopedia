Stanley J. Grenz
**Stanley Grenz** (1950-2005) an
[Evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical")
[Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") [theologian](Theologian "Theologian"),
[ethicist](Ethics "Ethics"), and proponent of a postmodern
evangelicalism. His *Theology for the Community of God*, a large
work of nearly 900 pages, sets forth his
[postmodern](Postmodernism "Postmodernism") evangelical theology.
Grenz became a leading exponent of this approach, and thus can be
considered as representative of postmodernism’s influence on
theology.^[[1]](#note-0)^ Toward the end of his life, he was
involved in the beginnings of the
[Emerging church](Emerging_church "Emerging church") movement.

Grenz received a BA from the University of Colorado at Boulder in
1973 and received an M.Div. at Denvery Seminary in 1976. He then
studied at the University of Munich where he received his D.Th.
under the supervision of
[Wolfhart Pannenberg](Wolfhart_Pannenberg "Wolfhart Pannenberg") in
1978. His dissertation was titled, "Isaac Backus--Puritan and
Baptist". Grenz suddenly passed away on March 12th, 2005 due to a
brain hemorrhage.

## Educational positions

For twelve years (1990-2002), Stan held the position of Pioneer
McDonald Professor of Baptist Heritage, Theology and Ethics at
Carey Theological College and at Regent College in Vancouver BC.
After a one-year sojourn as Distinguished Professor of Theology at
Baylor University and Truett Seminary in Waco TX (2002-2003), he
returned to Carey in August 2003 to resume his duties as Pioneer
McDonald Professor of Theology. In fall 2004, he assumed an
additional appointment as Professor of Theological Studies at Mars
Hill Graduate School, Seattle WA. Prior to his initial move to
Vancouver, he was Professor of Systematic Theology and Christian
Ethics at the North American Baptist Seminary, Sioux Falls SD
(1981-1990). While in the pastorate (1979-1981), he taught courses
both at the University of Winnipeg and at Winnipeg Theological
Seminary (now Providence Seminary). From 1996 to 1999 he carried an
additional appointment as Professor of Theology and Ethics
(Affiliate) at Northern Baptist Theological Seminary, Lombard IL.

has worked within the local church context as youth director and
assistant pastor (Northwest Baptist Church, Denver, CO, 1971-1976),
pastor (Rowandale Baptist Church, Winnipeg, MB 1979-1981), and
interim pastor on several occasions. In addition he has preached

seminaries in North America, Europe, Africa, Australia and Asia.

## Theology

Grenz was a leading expert on the theology of Wolfhart Pannenberg,
but he was also a favorite theologian of the emerging church
network.
[[3]](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/111/12.0.html) Grenz
is viewed by many evangelical scholars as the theologian who has
most influenced the postconservative evangelical/Emergent movement.
At a time when other evangelical thinkers were warning of the
dangers of [postmodernism](Postmodernism "Postmodernism"), Grenz
adopted a more open attitude that considered how the move from
foundationalist epistemology could be used as a theological method.
He also deemphasized the role of doctrine in evangelical theology,
preferring to focus on shared narrative and a renewed focus on
piety. This embrace of postmodernism has led many of Grenz's
critics, including David S. Dockery and
[D.A. Carson](D.A._Carson "D.A. Carson"), to question whether his
theology retained anything distinctly evangelical.
[[4]](http://www.evangelicaloutpost.com/archives/001300.html)

In their *Beyond Foundationalism* (2000), "Grenz and
[Franke](John_Franke "John Franke") are clearly distinguishing
themselves from historic [evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical")
[theology](Theology "Theology") and especially what has been meant
by [Sola Scriptura](Sola_Scriptura "Sola Scriptura"), namely, that
Scripture is first-order language and thus the final, sufficient
authority for all Christian faith and praxis. For them,
[Scripture](Scripture "Scripture") is authoritative because it is
the vehicle through which the Spirit speaks, yet in the Spirit's
appropriation of Scripture, the Spirit's intention is not simply
and totally tied to the author's intention in the text. Hence,
reminiscent of [Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth"), they are
reluctant to posit a one-to-one correspondence between the Word of
God and the words of scripture."
