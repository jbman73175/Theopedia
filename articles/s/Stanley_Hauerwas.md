In his career, Hauerwas has attempted to emphasize the importance
of virtue and character within the [Church](Church "Church"). He
has been an outspoken Christian pacifist and has promoted
nonviolence, having been mentored by Mennonite theologian John
Howard Yoder. Hauerwas has also been an opponent of nationalism,
particularly American patriotism, arguing that it has no place in
the Church. He has also been associated with the
[narrative theology](Narrative_theology "Narrative theology")
movement.

*TIME Magazine* in 2001 named him "America's Best Theologian". He
responded by saying "Best is not a theological category." That same
year, he was invited to give the prestigious Gifford Lectures at
St. Andrews in Scotland, which were published as
*With the Grain of the Universe*, a text in which
[Karl Barth's](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth") interpretation of
[Anselm](Anselm "Anselm")'s
[analogy of faith](Analogy_of_faith "Analogy of faith") was
featured.

Hauerwas is a prominent and influential theological ethicist in the
United States. As John Howard Yoder had attempted to demonstrate
what he felt were problems with Reinhold Niebuhr's ethics in his
1972 book *The Politics of Jesus*, Hauerwas attempted the same with
the positions of both H. Richard Niebuhr (particularly his 1951
book *Christ and Culture*) and
[Paul Tillich](Paul_Tillich "Paul Tillich"), thus calling into
question the modern philosophical foundations for just war
thinking. Hauerwas has also been deeply influenced by Catholic
philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, who uses Thomist thought regarding
virtue ethics to critique modern and postmodern culture.

As a teacher and lecturer, Hauerwas is known for his wit, sharp
criticisms of positions he disagrees with, breadth of reading, and
(more than) occasional use of profanity, which he explains as being
the result of having a brick-layer father.

While Hauerwas has been self-identified with the United Methodist
Church for the bulk of his career, as of his latest work, he has
begun to identify himself as an
[Anglican](Anglicanism "Anglicanism") and attends an Episcopal
Church in Chapel Hill, NC.
