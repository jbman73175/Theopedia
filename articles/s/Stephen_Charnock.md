## History

The events of Charnock's life are somewhat vague and have been
assembled from his writings and from various accounts of those who
knew him. Born in the St. Katharine Cree parish of London, he
studied at Emmanuel College in Cambridge, and was converted to the
Christian faith. After leaving the college, he held a position
possibly as a private teacher or tutor, then for a short time as a
minister of the faith in Southwark, winning others to the faith. He
then spent some time in Oxford at New College, where he gained a
position as senior proctor, after distinguishing himself there by
his learning and his labors.

Charnock has been described as "a grave and impressive preacher and
a man of fervent
piety"[[1]](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc03.c.i.html#c.i-Page_19),
but is best known for his writings, which are "distinguished for
sound theology, profound thinking, and lively imagination"
[[2]](http://www.puritansermons.com/charnock/charnoc4.htm). Nearly
all of the numerous writings attributed to him were transcribed
after his death.
