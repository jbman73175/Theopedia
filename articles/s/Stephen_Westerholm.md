**Stephen Westerholm** (b. 1949) is a Canadian scholar and
associate professor of biblical studies at McMaster University,
Hamilton, Ontario. He received BA and MA degrees from the
University of Toronto and a ThD from the University of Lund
(Sweden). He is noted for his work in
[Pauline studies](Pauline_studies "Pauline studies") and is most
recently known for his interaction with the
[New Perspective on Paul](New_Perspective_on_Paul "New Perspective on Paul").

Westerholm, in response to [Dunn](James_Dunn "James Dunn"),
[Wright](N._T._Wright "N. T. Wright"), Stendahl and others, writes
that "Students who want to know how a Rabbinic Jew perceived
humanity's place in God's world will read Paul with caution and
Luther not at all. On the other hand, students who want to
understand Paul, but feel that they have nothing to learn from
Martin Luther, should consider a career in metallurgy. Exegesis is
learned from the masters." ^[[1]](#note-0)^
