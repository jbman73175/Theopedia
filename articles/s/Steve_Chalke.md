Steve Chalke is a UK Christian leader. He is one of the most
influential leaders in the British Evangelical movement. Chalke is
on the leadership team of the UKs biggest Christian conference
Spring Harvest. He is best known for his work with Oasis Trust
which is a social action charity. Chalke serves on the boards of
many Christian organisations and is a regular feature on British
televison.

Thus, controversy erupted in 2004 when it became clear that Chalke
had denied the doctrine of Penal Substitution (PSA) in his book The
Lost Message of Jesus. A section in this book has been called
blasphemous by John Piper. The Evangelical Alliance censored Chalke
but did not expel him, and he continues to be a speaker for Spring
Harvest. When Spring Harvest and Word Alive separated in 2007 the
controversy over Chalke was once again fanned into flame as the
book Pierced for Our Transgressions had also been recently written.
NT Wright has strongly supported Chalke and claims that he does
after all believe in PSA despite an article by Chalke which denies
this categorically.
