## Early English Baptists

In the early 17th century, [Baptists](Baptists "Baptists") in
England developed along two different theological lines. The
**General Baptists** were so-called because they held to a General
Atonement -- the view that Christ in His death made a general
provision for all men, making salvation possible for all who would
believe. This is essentially identical to the
[Universal atonement](Universal_atonement "Universal atonement") of
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"). Early General Baptist
leaders included John Smyth and Thomas Helwys. The
**Particular Baptists**, on the other hand, were so-called because
they held to a
[Particular atonement](Definite_atonement "Definite atonement")
which is limited in its design to God's elect. The Particular view
of the atonement is that Christ in His death accomplished
redemption for particular individuals, usually referred to as the
elect. This position is identified with five-point
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"). Some early Particular Baptist
leaders included [Benjamin Keach](Benjamin_Keach "Benjamin Keach"),
Hanserd Knollys, and William Kiffin.

During the 18th century, General Baptists lapsed into theological
liberalism and practically disappeared from the scene in England.
In this same period, the Particular Baptists moved toward more
extreme doctrinal conservatism, which some have described as
[Hyper-Calvinism](Hyper-Calvinism "Hyper-Calvinism") and
[Antinomianism](Antinomianism "Antinomianism"). In 1785,
[Andrew Fuller](Andrew_Fuller "Andrew Fuller") (1754-1815)
published *The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation*, which helped turn
many Particular Baptists toward a new evangelicalism that was
dubbed
"[Fullerism](index.php?title=Fullerism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Fullerism (page does not exist)"),"
and eventually led to division among the Particular Baptists of
England. The "Fullerites" are probably best represented by Fuller
and [William Carey](William_Carey "William Carey") (1761-1834),
Baptist missionary to India. The leading spokesman for strict
Calvinism among the Particular Baptists was
[John Gill](John_Gill "John Gill") (1696-1771), perhaps best known
for his *Exposition of the Whole Bible*. Among the "Fuller strain"
of Particular Baptists, Calvinism declined and the practice of open
communion grew.

When the Baptist Union was founded in 1813, it was a Particular
Baptist organization. In 1833, it was restructured to allow for
membership of General Baptists. General and Particular Baptist work
was eventually united in the Baptist Union in 1891.

## Strict Baptists

Present day Strict Baptists of England are descendants of the
Particular Baptists. Sometimes they are referred to as
*Strict and Particular Baptists*. The term "strict" here refers to
the *strict* or *closed* position held with regard to membership
and communion. The majority of early Particular Baptists rejected
open membership and open communion -- one notable exception being
[John Bunyan](John_Bunyan "John Bunyan"), the author of
*Pilgrim's Progress*.

Strict Baptists represent the strain of Particular Baptists that
tended toward [hyper-Calvinism](Hyper-Calvinism "Hyper-Calvinism"),
maintained the practice of strict or closed communion, and remained
aloof from the Baptist Union of 1813. They are roughly equivalent
to the Primitive Baptists in the U. S. Leaders among them include
William Gadsby (1773-1844), whose
*A Selection of Hymns for Public Worship* is still in use among
their churches today, John Warburton (1776-1857), John Kershaw
(1792-1870), and [J. C. Philpot](J._C._Philpot "J. C. Philpot")
(1802-1869). Having no central organization or rallying point,
Strict Baptists were nicknamed based on the newspapers they
supported - *Christian Pathway* Strict Baptists, *Earthen Vessel*
Strict Baptists, *Gospel Herald* Strict Baptists, and
*Gospel Standard* Strict Baptists.

*Earthen Vessel*, *Gospel Herald* and other Strict Baptists united
in what would later become the Grace Baptist Assembly (founded 1980
as a merger of the Strict Baptist Assembly and the Assembly of
baptised churches). The Grace Baptist Assembly churches represent a
modification of Strict Baptists close to the "Fullerism" of the
18th century. These English churches additionally meet together in
three regional associations - Association of Grace Baptist Churches
(East Anglia), Association of Grace Baptist Churches (East
Midlands), Association of Grace Baptist Churches (South East) - and
one fellowship - the Fellowship of Northern Particular Baptist
Churches. The Gospel Standard Strict Baptists, remains the closest
to the roots of the movement, both theologically and practically.
Most Strict Baptists do not own a TV, go to the movies, or listen
to modern music. They stand faithful in their opposition to
Fuller's modified Calvinism, open membership and open communion. At
times, Gospel Standard Strict Baptists have been called
*Gadsbyites* after William Gadsby. In recent times, B. A.
Ramsbottom has been an outstanding leader among the Strict
Baptists, serving as editor of the *Gospel Standard* magazine since
1971.

In 1995, the Grace Baptist Assembly had over 10,000 members in
about 260 churches. The Gospel Standard Strict Baptists had 6400
members in 156 churches in the British Isles, plus 3 churches in
the United States.

## Order of service

Meetings in Gospel standard churches follow a non-litergical
litergical pattern. A typical service is as follows: Opening Hymn
(from the Gadsby's selection, Scripture reading (King James version
only), Long prayer, Hymn, Sermon, Hymn, Closing prayer. Ministers
are usually older men chosen by vote by church members. Ministers
are almost always untrained. Sermons are not written, and preachers
rely on God to give them "a word". Sermons are strictly bible
based, often repetative and void of humour. Many ministers will not
mention any non-biblical person by name, as they do not want to
detract from the word of God. If a church member has problems or is
ill, the minister will simply pray for "the one amongst us who is
in sickness". Many chapels are pastorless and rely on visiting
preachers. If a preacher is unavailable then a "reading service"
will be held. The consists of a male church member reading a sermon
from a book. Women are unable to hold positions of leadership.
Women are not allowed to pray in prayer meetings (this is reserved
only for baptised male members). Many churches even forbid women
from speaking at church business meetings. Women must also cover
their heads in public worship, and are discouraged from wearing
trousers, wearing make-up or having pierced ears. Musical
instraments are usually restricted to an organ, and many churches
accapella. Communion is held once a month, usually on the first
sunday evening of the month and is refered to as "Ordnance". This
meeting is reserved strictly for persons baptised in Gospel
standard churches. No other christian many partake. This is due to
an over literal interpretation of the G.S. rules of faith and
practice. Which states the only a person "of the same faith and
practice" may partake of bread and wine. This meeting is also used
to welcome into membership a newly baptised person, or someone who
has transfered membership from another G.S. church. Baptised
members are few compared to service attendance. Many people who
have spent the whole of their lives in the denomination many never
get baptised. This often leads to a two tier attitude in the
denomination.
