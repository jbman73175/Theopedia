**Strong's Concordance** ^[[1]](#note-0)^ is an exhaustive
cross-reference of every word in the [Bible](Bible "Bible"),
compiled by
[James Strong](index.php?title=James_Strong&action=edit&redlink=1 "James Strong (page does not exist)")
and first published in 1890. With the help of more than one-hundred
colleagues, Strong linked each original-language root word to an
entry number in the dictionary (now known as "Strong's numbers"),
and listed every verse containing that word in the
[King James](King_James_Version "King James Version") text in order
of its appearance, giving a short excerpt of the sentence in which
each word is found. Strong's system has been developed and used for
other
[translations of the Bible](Translation_of_the_Bible "Translation of the Bible")
besides the KJV.
