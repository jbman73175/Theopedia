***Studies in Theological Interpretation*** is a book series
published by [Baker Academic](http://www.bakeracademic.com) and is
edited by Craig G. Bartholomew (Redeemer), Joel B. Green (Asbury)
and Christopher R. Seitz (St. Andrews). "In sum, the series is
dedicated to the pursuit of constructive theological interpretation
of the church's inheritance of prophets and apostles in a manner
that is open to reconnection with the long history of theological
reading in church. The primary emphasis is on the constructive
theological contribution of the biblical texts themselves" (series
preface).
