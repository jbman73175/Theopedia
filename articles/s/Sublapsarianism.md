**Sublapsarianism** is one of the primary views of the logical
order of God's decrees regarding the creation, fall, and redemption
of mankind. It is very similar to
[infralapsarianism](Infralapsarianism "Infralapsarianism"), putting
God’s decrees in the following order: (1) God decreed to create
human beings, (2) God decreed to permit the fall, (3) God decreed
to provide salvation sufficient to all, (4) God decreed to choose
some to receive this salvation. The only difference between
infralapsarianism and sublapsarianism is whether God decreed to
provide salvation through Jesus Christ and then decreed to choose
some to be saved, or vice-versa.
