"Christ is only functionally subordinate to the Father,
*not [ontologically](Ontology "Ontology") subordinate* ...
Evangelicals strongly affirm the ontological equality of Son with
Father. Yet it is difficult to find doctrinal statements—either in
churches or in seminaries—in which the Son is said to be
functionally subordinate to the Father. Yet John 14:28; Phil
2:6-11; 1 Cor 11:3; 15:28 all plainly teach the eternal
subordination of the Son (John 14 and 1 Cor 11 speak of his present
subordination; Phil 2 speaks of his subordination in eternity past;
and 1 Cor 15 speaks of his subordination in eternity future). Since
these same books strongly affirm the ontological equality of Son
with Father, the subordination in view must be functional."

In other words, to say that the Father and the Son are
"ontologically equal" means that their being is not to be
distinguished, thus preserving the [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine")
of [monotheism](Monotheism "Monotheism") which is essential to the
larger doctrine of the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"). Furthermore,
to say that the Son (or Jesus) is "functionally subordinate" means
that Jesus is subordinate according to his functions in the
Godhead.

[Cyril of Alexandria](Cyril_of_Alexandria "Cyril of Alexandria")
(376-444) said that,"yet we are not ignorant that while he remained
God, he also became man and subject to God, according to the law
suitable to the nature of the manhood. But how could he become the
God or Lord of himself? Consequently as man, and with regard to the
measure of his humiliation, it is said that he is equally with us
subject to God; thus he became under the Law, although as God he
spake the Law and was the Law-giver."
(*Epistle of Cyril to Nestorius with the XII Anathematisms*)
