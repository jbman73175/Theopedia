## Gracious purposes in planned suffering

[God](God "God") works "all things according to the counsel of his
will" (Ephesians 1:11), even trials and tribulation and suffering.
Since "we know that for those who love God all things work together
for good, for those who are called according to his purpose"
(Romans 8:28), we can be confident that even in suffering God has
purposed and planned everything for our good.

One of these purposes is that we comfort others who have likewise
suffered:

"If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if
we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when
you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer." - 2
Corinthians 1:6

## Our salvation is founded on the predestined suffering of the Son

"... for truly in this city there were gathered together against
your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both
[Herod](index.php?title=Herod&action=edit&redlink=1 "Herod (page does not exist)")
and [Pontius Pilate](Pontius_Pilate "Pontius Pilate"), along with
the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever your hand
and your plan had predestined to take place." - Acts 4:27-28

## Joyful and expected suffering

-   "...we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation
    produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character
    hope. Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has
    been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to
    us." - Romans 5:3-5 (NKJV)

-   "...that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and
    the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if,
    by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead." -
    Philippians 3:10

-   "...though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things
    which He suffered." - Hebrews 5:8

## Quotes

-   "When confronted by the sheer savage immensity of worldly
    suffering--when we see the entire littoral rim of the Indian Ocean
    strewn with tens of thousands of corpses, a third of them
    children's--no Christian is licensed to utter odious banalities
    about God's inscrutable counsels or blasphemous suggestions that
    all this mysteriously serves God's good ends. We are permitted only
    to hate death and waste and the imbecile forces of chance that
    shatter living souls, to believe that creation is in agony in its
    bonds, to see this world as divided between two kingdoms--knowing
    all the while that it is only charity that can sustain us against
    'fate,' and that must do so until the end of days." - David B.
    Hart, "Tremors of Doubt: What kind of God would allow a deadly
    tsunami?" (Wall Street Journal, December 31, 2004)
