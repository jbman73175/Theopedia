**Suicide** (from Latin *sui caedere*, to kill oneself) is the act
of ending one's own life.

## Unforgivable?

Some Christians would deny this, appealing to Matthew 12:31-32
where only blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is "unforgivable".

## A form of murder?

In John Bunyan's famous allegory, *The Pilgrim's Progress*, the two
characters Christian and Hopeful discuss suicide in the dungeon of
the Giant Despair, giving us an insight into Bunyan's views of
suicide as a form of murder:

"CHR. Brother, said Christian, what shall we do? The life that we
now live is miserable. For my part I know not whether is best, to
live thus, or to die out of hand. "My soul chooseth strangling
rather than life", and the grave is more easy for me than this
dungeon. [Job 7:15] Shall we be ruled by the Giant?

HOPE. Indeed, our present condition is dreadful, and death would be
far more welcome to me than thus for ever to abide; but yet, let us
consider, the Lord of the country to which we are going hath said,
Thou shalt do no murder: no, not to another man's person; much
more, then, are we forbidden to take his counsel to kill ourselves.
Besides, he that kills another, can but commit murder upon his
body; but for one to kill himself is to kill body and soul at once.
And, moreover, my brother, thou talkest of ease in the grave; but
hast thou forgotten the hell, for certain the murderers go? "For no
murderer hath eternal life," &c"

## Can a Christian commit suicide?

Many argue that suicide is *probably*, but not always, a fruit of a
non-Christian, citing verses like Exodus 20:13 ("Thou shall not
kill"), and Hebrews 10:26 ("If we deliberately keep on sinning
after we have recieved knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for
sins is left"). But much allowance and exception is given for
likely reality that some Christians do commit this sin. "A
Christian, who in a weak moment, falls into the sin of self-murder
cannot be characterized as a habitual murderer."
