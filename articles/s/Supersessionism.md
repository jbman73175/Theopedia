**Supersessionism** is the traditional
[Christian](Christian "Christian") belief that
[Christianity](Christianity "Christianity") is the fulfillment of
Biblical [Judaism](Judaism "Judaism"), and therefore that Jews who
deny that [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") is the Jewish Messiah fall short
of their calling as God's Chosen people.

Supersessionism, in its more radical form, maintains that the Jews
are no longer considered to be God's Chosen people in any sense.
This understanding is generally termed "replacement theology."

The traditional form of supersessionism does not theorize a
replacement; instead it argues that Israel has been superseded only
in the sense that the Church has been entrusted with the
fulfillment of the promises of which Jewish Israel is the trustee.
This belief has served not only as the explanation for why
believers in Christ should not become Jews, but is also the reason
that Jews are not exempted by the Christian churches, from the call
of the Gospel to believe in Jesus Christ for salvation from sin and
from the penalties due to sin.

In recent times, the doctrine of supersessionism has been blamed
for mistreatment of the Jews in the past. Some liberal Protestant
groups have therefore formally renounced supersessionism, affirming
that Jews and other non-Christians have a valid way to find God
within their own faith, which breaks from historic
[Protestant teaching](Sola_Fide "Sola Fide").
[Dispensationalism](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") affirms
that salvation is only through faith in Christ, and that Jews fall
short of obtaining the kingdom of the promised Messiah, unless they
are converted to Christianity. However, in their view, a future
mass conversion will result in the restoration of the *nation*
Israel prior to the
[Millennium](Millennial_Kingdom "Millennial Kingdom"), apart from
the church dispensation. This anticipation of a future role for the
ethnic and geo-political *nation* of Israel in the plan of God,
apart from the Church, is what is meant by some dispensationalists
who style themselves as rejectors of "supersessionism" or
"replacement theology", and thus they are using the terms in a way
that is distinctive to their expectation of future events.
