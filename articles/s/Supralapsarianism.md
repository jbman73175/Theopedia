"**Supralapsarianism** is the view that God, contemplating man as
yet unfallen, chose some to receive eternal life and rejected all
others. So a supralapsarian would say that the reprobate
(non-elect) vessels of wrath fitted for destruction (Rom. 9:22)
were first ordained to that role, and then the means by which they
fell into sin was ordained. In other words, supralapsarianism
suggests that God's decree of election logically preceded His
decree to permit Adam's fallâ€”so that their damnation is first of
all an act of divine sovereignty, and only secondarily an act of
divine justice."

This view is most often contrasted with
[Infralapsarianism](Infralapsarianism "Infralapsarianism") (also
known sometimes as "sublapsarianism") which suggests that God's
decree to permit the fall logically preceded His decree of
election. So when God chose the elect and passed over the
non-elect, He was contemplating them all as fallen creatures.
