**Synergism**, in general, may be defined as two or more agents
working together to produce a result not obtainable by any of the
agents independently. The word synergy or synergism comes from two
[Greek](Greek "Greek") words, *erg* meaning to work and *syn*
meaning together, hence synergism is a "working together."

Regarding the [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation"), this is essentially the view
that [God](God "God") and [humanity](Humanity "Humanity")
*work together*, each contributing their part to accomplish
salvation in and for the individual. This is the view of salvation
found in [Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism") and its
theological predecessor
[Semi-Pelagianism](Semi-Pelagianism "Semi-Pelagianism"). John
Hendryx has stated it this way. Synergism is "...the doctrine that
there are two efficient agents in regeneration, namely the human
will and the divine Spirit, which, in the strict sense of the term,
cooperate. This theory accordingly holds that the soul has not lost
in the fall all inclination toward holiness, nor all power to seek
for it under the influence of ordinary motives." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

In other words, God has done His part, and humanity must do theirs.
This is opposed to the [monergistic](Monergism "Monergism") view
^[[2]](#note-1)^, held by [Reformed](Reformed "Reformed"),
[Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") ^[[3]](#note-2)^
^[[4]](#note-3)^ and Lutheran ^[[5]](#note-4)^ groups where
salvation is seen as the work of God alone.

A distinction is to be made, however, between Calvinism and
Lutheranism. Calvin seems to have held that God's calling to faith
is irresistible, and is the result, not of God's mercy and grace in
Christ, but rather flows out of God's divine decree of election.
^[[6]](#note-5)^. The Lutheran Church, however, holds that a person
may choose to resist the work of the Holy Spirit. ^[[7]](#note-6)^
