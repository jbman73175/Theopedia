Council of the National Synod of the Reformed Church. Remontrants
sit at the table.
The **Synod of Dordt** (1618-1619), held in order to settle
controversy in the Dutch churches initiated by the rise of
[Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism"), met in the city of
Dordrecht as a national assembly of the Dutch Reformed Church, to
which were also invited voting representatives from the
[Reformed churches](Reformed_churches "Reformed churches") in eight
foreign countries.

The convocation and proceedings of the Synod of Dordt (1618- 1619)
may be considered "among the most interesting events of the
seventeenth century. The Westminster Assembly was indeed more
immediately interesting to British and American Presbyterians, yet
the Synod of Dordt had a species of importance peculiar to itself
and altogether pre-eminent. It was not merely a meeting of select
divines of a single nation, but a convention of the
[Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") world, to bear testimony
against a rising and obtrusive error; to settle a question in which
all the Reformed churches of Europe had an immediate and deep
interest. The question was whether the opinions of Arminius, which
were then agitating so many minds, could be reconciled with the
confession of the Belgic churches." (Thomas Scott,
*The Articles of the Synod of Dort*, Sprinkle Publications, 1993
reprint, p. 5.)

This synod convened on November 13, 1618 consisting of 39 pastors
and 18 ruling Elders from the Belgic churches, 5 professors from
the universities of Holland, 19 delegates from the Reformed
churches in Germany and Switzerland, and 5 professors and bishops
from Great Britain. France was also invited but did not attend. The
Synod was thus constituted of 86 voting members in all. There were
154 formal sessions and many side conferences held during the six
months that the Synod met to consider these matters. The last
session of the Synod was held on May 9, 1619.

## Result

“The Synod gave a very close examination to the ‘five points’ which
had been advanced by the Remonstrants, and compared the teaching in
them with the testimony of Scripture. Failing to reconcile that
teaching with the Word of God, . . . they unanimously rejected
them. They felt however, that a mere rejection was not sufficient.
It remained for them to set forth the true Calvinistic teaching in
relationship to those matters which had been called into question.
This they proceeded to do, embodying the Calvinistic position in
five chapters which have ever since been known as
[the five points of Calvinism](TULIP "TULIP")." (Steel and Thomas,
*The Five Points of Calvinism*, P&R Publishing, 1963, p. 14,
quoting Ben A. Warburton, *Calvinism*, p. 61.)

## Additional Background

"The controversy was purely theological in its nature, but owing to
the intimate connection of Church and State it became inevitably
entangled in political issues, and shook the whole country. The
Reformed Churches in France, Switzerland, Germany, England, and
Scotland took a deep interest in it, and sided, upon the whole,
with the Calvinistic party; while the
[Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran") Church sympathized to some extent
with the Arminian." (Schaff, *Creeds*, Vol. I, 510)

"Orthodox Calvinism achieved a complete triumph. The
[Five Articles of Remonstrance](Five_Articles_of_Remonstrance "Five Articles of Remonstrance")
were unanimously rejected, and five Calvinistic canons adopted,
together with the
[Belgic Confession](Belgic_Confession "Belgic Confession") and the
[Heidelberg Catechism](Heidelberg_Catechism "Heidelberg Catechism").
A thorough and most excellent revision of the Dutch Bible from the
Hebrew and Greek was also ordered, besides other decisions which
lie beyond our purpose.

"The victory of orthodoxy was obscured by the succeeding deposition
of about two hundred Arminian clergymen, and by the preceding
though independent arrest of the political leaders of the
Remonstrants, at the instigation of Maurice.
[Grotius](Hugo_Grotius "Hugo Grotius") was condemned by the
States-General to perpetual imprisonment, but escaped through the
ingenuity of his wife (1621). Van Olden Barneveldt was unjustly
condemned to death for alleged high-treason, and beheaded at the
Hague (May 14, 1619). His sons took revenge in a fruitless attempt
against the life of Prince Maurice." (Schaff, *Creeds*, Vol. I,
514)

"The banishment of the Arminians was of short duration. After the
death of Prince Maurice of Nassau (1625), and under the reign of
his milder brother and successor, Frederick Henry, they were
allowed to return and to establish churches and schools in every
town of Holland, which became more and more a land of religious
toleration and liberty.

"The distinctive Arminian doctrines of sin and grace, free-will and
predestination, have been extensively adopted in the Episcopal
Church since the reign of Charles I., and in the last century by
the [Methodists](Methodist "Methodist") of Great Britain and
America, and thereby have attained a larger territory and influence
than they ever had in the land of their birth. Methodism holds to
the essential doctrines of the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation"), but also to the five
points of Arminianism, with some important evangelical
modifications." (Schaff, *Creeds*, Vol. I, 516)
