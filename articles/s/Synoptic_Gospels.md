The **Synoptic Gospels** is a term used by modern New Testament
scholars for the Gospels according to
[Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew"),
[Mark](Gospel_of_Mark "Gospel of Mark"), and
[Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke") of the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") in the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"). They are three of the four gospels, of
which the [Gospel of John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") is not
included due to it's different style from the other three gospels.

The term synoptic is derived from a combination of the
[Greek](Greek "Greek") words συν (syn = together) and οψις (opsis =
seeing) to indicate that the contents of these three Gospels can be
viewed side-by-side, whether in a vertical parallel column
synopsis, or a horizontal synoptic alignment.
