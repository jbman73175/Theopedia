"The **Synoptic Problem**, briefly stated, is the attempt to
explain how [Matthew](Gospel_of_Matthew "Gospel of Matthew"),
[Mark](Gospel_of_Mark "Gospel of Mark"), and
[Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke") agree, yet disagree, in
these three areas: content, wording, and order... Synoptic Problem
is the term that has been used to describe the task in determining
the precise relationships between the first three gospels. Scholars
note the alternating array of agreements and disagreements among
the three gospels and wonder why and how the disparities came to
be. Why, on the one hand, do the
[Synoptic Gospels](Synoptic_Gospels "Synoptic Gospels") have so
much material in common? About 90 percent of Mark's material is
found in Matthew, while about 50 percent of Mark is found in Luke.
In addition, nearly 235 verses in Matthew and Luke are similar to
one another. In those places where agreement appears, incredible
similarities can extend even to identical tense and mood for every
word in an entire verse (or more). Given that
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") probably spoke in Aramaic, these
similarities are even more asounding. In some places, the
Evangelists have identical parenthetical material," (Williams,
*Two Gospels From One*, p. 22-23).

## Synoptic theories

This section is a brief overview of current speculative solutions
to the Synoptic Problem including scholarly thought first proposed
in the 1800's and traveling back through traditional church history
and church views citing the writings of the ancient church fathers.
Most modern study focuses on the first theory.

-   The
    [Two-source hypothesis](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-source_hypothesis "wikipedia:Two-source hypothesis")
    states that Matthew and Luke independently copied Mark for its
    narrative framework and independently added discourse material from
    a non-extant collection of sayings which scholars denote as
    [Q](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_document "wikipedia:Q document").
    Much work has gone into speculating the extent and wording of Q,
    particularly since the discovery of the
    [Gospel of Thomas](Gospel_of_Thomas "Gospel of Thomas") which
    attests to the *sayings* gospel genre.
    [Holtzmann's](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Julius_Holtzmann "wikipedia:Heinrich Julius Holtzmann")
    1863 theory posited an Ur-Marcus in the place of canonical Mark,
    with our Mark being a later revision. Some scholars occasionally
    propose an unattested revision of Mark, a deutero-Mark, being the
    base of what Matthew and Luke used.

-   The
    [Farrer hypothesis](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrer_hypothesis "wikipedia:Farrer hypothesis")
    posits that Mark was written first and Matthew used Mark, but that
    Luke used both, thus dispensing with the hypothetical Q document.

-   The
    [Griesbach hypothesis](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griesbach_hypothesis "wikipedia:Griesbach hypothesis")
    holds that Matthew was written first, and Luke used it in preparing
    his gospel. Then, Mark conflated the two in a procedure that mostly
    followed where Matthew and Luke agree in order except for discourse
    material.

-   The
    [Augustinian hypothesis](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustinian_hypothesis "wikipedia:Augustinian hypothesis")
    holds that Matthew was written first, then Mark, then Luke, and
    each Evangelist depended on those who preceded him. This position
    is in the closest agreement with church father testimony of the
    gospels origins. John Wenham was considered one of the prominent
    scholars who supported the Augustinian hypothesis. A variant of
    this hypothesis that was popular mainly among
    [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
    scholars in the first half of the 20th century was that Matthew was
    written first, and copied by Mark and then Luke, but that Matthew
    was written in [Aramaic](Aramaic "Aramaic"), and when it was
    translated to [Greek](Greek "Greek") the translator liberally
    adapted some of the phraseology of the other gospels which were
    already in Greek.

Other theories usually posit more hypothetical and proto-sources.
Generally their plausibility is in inverse relation to the number
of additional sources. For example, Pierson Parker (1953) argued
for a proto-Matthew in addition to Q. Marie-Ã‰mile Boismard calls
for seven hypothetical documents, one of them a form of Q.
