**Syriac** is the most important later dialect of
[Aramaic](Aramaic "Aramaic"). It originated in the city-state of
Edessa in Northern Syria. It is first recorded in inscriptions
written in the monumental Estrangelo script in the 2nd century BC.
All extant literature is Christian. The earliest material dates
from the 2nd century AD. Syriac spread widely throughout the
Near-East, and into Persia. It was at its widest extent during the
7th century AD. The Arab conquest during that time meant that
thereafter it declined and was replaced by Arabic in popular use.
The literary period ends in the 13th century, when Syria was
devastated by the Mongols. However oral use has continued to our
own day. The Syriac dialect of Turoyo is spoken today in the plain
of Tur Abdin in South-Eastern Turkey.

During the 6th century the language began to diverge into Eastern
and Western dialects. This was related to the ecclesiastical splits
of the period following the Council of Ephesus in 433 (which
condemned the Nestorians) and the Council of Chalcedon in 450
(which condemned the monophysites).

The East Syriac dialect and script is used by the
[Nestorians](Nestorianism "Nestorianism"), based in Persia, who
spread the gospel along the Silk Route as far as China in the 7th
century. A stele in Chinese and Syriac dated 781 AD was found in
Xi'an.^[[1]](#note-0)^ Modern Mongolian is still written in Syriac
letters. East Syriac script represents vowels by clouds of dots
above and below the letters, when vowels are written at all.

The West Syriac dialect is used by the
[Monophysites](Monophysitism "Monophysitism"). This uses the Serto
script. One innovation by Jacob of Edessa was the use of tiny Greek
vowels written above and below the line to represent vowels. He
also sought to get vowels written on the line like consonants, but
in vain. West Syriac contains the richest collection of material
translated from Greek.

Neo-Syriac began to be printed when an American mission to Urmiah
in the 1840's installed a printing press.

As knowledge of Syriac declined, and as pressure from Islam grew,
Garshuni came into existence. This is Arabic, but written using
Syriac script, in order to conceal the contents from possible
Moslem persecutors.
