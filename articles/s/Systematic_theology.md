**Systematic theology** is a discipline which addresses theological
topics one by one (e.g. [God](God "God"), [Sin](Sin "Sin"),
[Humanity](Humanity "Humanity")) and attempts to summarize all the
biblical teaching on each particular subject. Sometimes called
**constructive theology** or even **dogmatic theology**, the goal
is to present the major themes (i.e.
[doctrines](Doctrine "Doctrine")) of the Christian faith in an
organized and ordered overview that remains faithful to the
biblical witness.

Systematic theology integrates
[biblical](Biblical_theology "Biblical theology"),
[historical](Historical_theology "Historical theology") and
sometimes
[philosophical theology](Philosophical_theology "Philosophical theology")
into its methodology. Its main goal is to draw a clear description
of what the [Bible](Bible "Bible") teaches about a particular
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine"). Furthermore, systematic theology
not only looks to biblically construct individual doctrines of the
Christian faith, but remains aware of the cause-effect relationship
of each doctrine. That is, on the one hand, if one doctrine is
changed, effects will take place in other areas of doctrine. On the
other hand, each doctrine has implications for other doctrines. For
example, within the
[doctrine of Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") (i.e.,
Christology) the belief in Jesus' resurrection means that we are
not left in our sins (cf. 1 Cor 15:17). Jesus has conquered sin,
and those who are in Christ also experience this victory (cf. Rom
6). Moreover, Christians have a future hope that they too will be
resurrected and experience
[eternal life](Eternal_life "Eternal life"). These are just a few
of many other examples of how each doctrine is interrelated to one
another. In the end, systematic theology should naturally flow into
[practical theology](Practical_theology "Practical theology") where
the conclusions drawn from Scripture are made applicable to the
[Church](Church "Church").

## General areas of systematic theology

-   **Prolegomena** - the study of methods and presuppositions
    before one does systematic theology (sometimes this involves the
    study of how God [reveals](Revelation "Revelation") himself).
-   **Bibliology** - the study of the [Bible](Bible "Bible").
-   **Theology Proper** - the study of the doctrine of
    [God](God "God").
-   **Christology** - the study of [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus").
-   **Pneumatology** - the study of the
    [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit").
-   **Anthropology** - the study of
    [humanity](Anthropology "Anthropology").
-   **Soteriology** - the study of
    [Salvation](Salvation "Salvation").
-   **Ecclesiology** - the study of the [Church](Church "Church").
-   **Eschatology** - the study of last things or
    [end times](End_times "End times").
-   **Angelology** - the study of the angelic beings.

## History

The systematic presentation of the Christian faith is not a new
concept.
[Wolfhart Pannenberg](Wolfhart_Pannenberg "Wolfhart Pannenberg")
writes that "systematic theology... emerged long before the term
came into common use. Materially the systematic presentation of
Christian teaching is very much older. It was already the object of
[Gnostic](Gnosticism "Gnosticism") systems in the 2nd century, and
although it remained merely implicit in the works of the early
Apologists, and anti-Gnostic fathers like
[Irenaeus](Irenaeus "Irenaeus"), [Origen](Origen "Origen")
presented his work on origins (*peri-archon*) in the form of a
systematic presentation of the Christian
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of [God](God "God")."

## Interpreting the Bible

Systematic theology also has major implications in the area of
interpreting scripture. For example, the
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity")
is not gathered from one passage of the Bible. Instead, the Trinity
is an authoritative interpretation of what *all* of scripture says.
Or, as David Yeago puts it, scripture contains "a pattern of
implicit and explicit judgments concerning the God of Israel and
his relationship to the crucified and risen Jesus of
Nazareth."^[[2]](#note-1)^ Although some passages in the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") may appear to show a
clear distinction between [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") and
[God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father") (e.g. John 17),
other passages that clearly teach
[monotheism](Monotheism "Monotheism") (e.g. Ex. 20:3; Deut. 6:4)
must be taken into account before a final interpretation can be
concluded. A correct interpretation of scripture must take into
account all relevant passages in the [Bible](Bible "Bible"), and
this is done through the method of a systematic reading of
scripture.
