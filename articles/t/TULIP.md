## History of TULIP

There is no certainty regarding the origin of the acronym TULIP.
However, the five points of Calvinism were discussed, as such,
before the popular rise of this acronym, for example in R. L.
Dabney's work, *The Five Points of Calvinism*, circa 1878. Dabney's
five headings are total depravity, effectual calling, God's
election, particular redemption, and perseverance of the
saints.^[[1]](#note-0)^

The earliest use of TULIP in this regard appears to be in 1905 by
Rev. Cleland Boyd McAfee, in a lecture before the Presbyterian
Union, Newark, NJ, as recorded by William H. Vail, writing in
*The New Outlook* (1913).^[[2]](#note-1)^

The popular use of TULIP as a teaching device was stimulated by
[Loraine Boettner](Loraine_Boettner "Loraine Boettner") in
*The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination* first published in
1932.^[[3]](#note-2)^

## The Five Points of Calvinism

### Total depravity

#### In the Canons of Dort:

*See main page: [Canons of Dort](Canons_of_Dort "Canons of Dort")*
Therefore, all people are conceived in sin and are born children of
wrath, unfit for any saving good, inclined to evil, dead in their
sins, and slaves to sin; without the grace of the regenerating Holy
Spirit they are neither willing nor able to return to God, to
reform their distorted nature, or even to dispose themselves to
such reform. (Human Corruption, Conversion to God, and the Way It
Occurs, Article 3)^[[4]](#note-3)^

#### In the Westminster Confession:

*See main page: [Westminster Confession](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession")*
Man, by his fall into a state of sin, has wholly lost all ability
of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation: so as, a
natural man, being altogether averse from that good, and dead in
sin, is not able, by his own strength, to convert himself, or to
prepare himself thereunto. (Chapter 9, Paragraph
3)^[[5]](#note-4)^

*See main page: [Total depravity](Total_depravity "Total depravity")*
*Contrast with [Universal prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace")*
### Unconditional election

#### In the Canons of Dort:

The fact that some receive from God the gift of faith within time,
and that others do not, stems from his eternal decision. For "all
his works are known to God from eternity" (Acts 15:18; Ephesians
1:11). In accordance with this decision he graciously softens the
hearts, however hard, of his chosen ones and inclines them to
believe, but by his just judgment he leaves in their wickedness and
hardness of heart those who have not been chosen. And in this
especially is disclosed to us his act--unfathomable, and as
merciful as it is just--of distinguishing between people equally
lost. This is the well-known decision of election and reprobation
revealed in God's Word. This decision the wicked, impure, and
unstable distort to their own ruin, but it provides holy and godly
souls with comfort beyond words. (Divine Election and Reprobation,
Article 6)^[[6]](#note-5)^

#### In the Westminster Confession:

By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some men
and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life; and others
foreordained to everlasting death. (Chapter 3 Paragraph
3)^[[7]](#note-6)^

These angels and men, thus predestinated, and foreordained, are
particularly and unchangeably designed, and their number so certain
and definite, that it cannot be either increased or diminished.
(Chapter 3 Paragraph 4)^[[8]](#note-7)^

*See main page: [Unconditional election](Unconditional_election "Unconditional election")*
*See also [Election](Election "Election"), [Predestination](Predestination "Predestination"), and [Foreknowledge of God](Foreknowledge_of_God "Foreknowledge of God")*
### Limited atonement

#### In the Canons of Dort:

For it was the entirely free plan and very gracious will and
intention of God the Father that the enlivening and saving
effectiveness of his Son's costly death should work itself out in
all his chosen ones, in order that he might grant justifying faith
to them only and thereby lead them without fail to salvation. In
other words, it was God's will that Christ through the blood of the
cross (by which he confirmed the new covenant) should effectively
redeem from every people, tribe, nation, and language all those and
only those who were chosen from eternity to salvation and given to
him by the Father; that he should grant them faith (which, like the
Holy Spirit's other saving gifts, he acquired for them by his
death); that he should cleanse them by his blood from all their
sins, both original and actual, whether committed before or after
their coming to faith; that he should faithfully preserve them to
the very end; and that he should finally present them to himself, a
glorious people, without spot or wrinkle. (Christ's Death and Human
Redemption Through It, Article 8)^[[9]](#note-8)^

#### In the Westminster Confession:

God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and
Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise
again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not
justified, until the Holy Spirit does, in due time, actually apply
Christ unto them. (Chapter 11 Paragraph 4)^[[10]](#note-9)^

*See main page: [Limited atonement](Limited_atonement "Limited atonement")*
*See also [Atonement of Christ](Atonement_of_Christ "Atonement of Christ") and [Penal substitutionary atonement](Penal_substitutionary_atonement "Penal substitutionary atonement")*
### Irresistible grace

#### In the Canons of Dort:

The fact that others who are called through the ministry of the
gospel do come and are brought to conversion must not be credited
to man, as though one distinguishes himself by free choice from
others who are furnished with equal or sufficient grace for faith
and conversion (as the proud heresy of Pelagius maintains). No, it
must be credited to God: just as from eternity he chose his own in
Christ, so within time he effectively calls them, grants them faith
and repentance, and, having rescued them from the dominion of
darkness, brings them into the kingdom of his Son, in order that
they may declare the wonderful deeds of him who called them out of
darkness into this marvelous light, and may boast not in
themselves, but in the Lord, as apostolic words frequently testify
in Scripture. (Human Corruption, Conversion to God, and the Way It
Occurs, Article 10)^[[11]](#note-10)^

#### In the Westminster Confession:

All those whom God hath predestinated unto life, and those only, He
is pleased, in His appointed time, effectually to call, by His Word
and Spirit, out of that state of sin and death, in which they are
by nature to grace and salvation, by Jesus Christ; enlightening
their minds spiritually and savingly to understand the things of
God, taking away their heart of stone, and giving unto them an
heart of flesh; renewing their wills, and, by His almighty power,
determining them to that which is good, and effectually drawing
them to Jesus Christ: yet so, as they come most freely, being made
willing by His grace. (Chapter 10 Paragraph 1)^[[12]](#note-11)^

*See main page: [Irresistible grace](Irresistible_grace "Irresistible grace")*
*See also [Faith](Faith "Faith"), [Repentance](Repentance "Repentance"), and [Regeneration](Regeneration "Regeneration")*
### Perseverance of the saints

#### In the Canons of Dort:

Because of these remnants of sin dwelling in them and also because
of the temptations of the world and Satan, those who have been
converted could not remain standing in this grace if left to their
own resources. But God is faithful, mercifully strengthening them
in the grace once conferred on them and powerfully preserving them
in it to the end. (The Perseverance of the Saints, Article
3)^[[13]](#note-12)^

#### In the Westminster Confession:

They, whom God has accepted in His Beloved, effectually called, and
sanctified by His Spirit, can neither totally nor finally fall away
from the state of grace, but shall certainly persevere therein to
the end, and be eternally saved. (Chapter 17 Paragraph
1)^[[14]](#note-13)^

*See main page: [Perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints")*
*See also [Lordship salvation](Lordship_salvation "Lordship salvation") and [Assurance of salvation](Assurance_of_salvation "Assurance of salvation")*
