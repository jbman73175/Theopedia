**Talbot School of Theology** is a non-denomination seminary in La
Mirada, CA. "In 1952, during his last year as Biola's president,
[Louis] Talbot worked to establish a fully accredited theological
seminary. The seminary's first dean was noted Christian scholar
[Charles Feinberg](index.php?title=Charles_Feinberg&action=edit&redlink=1 "Charles Feinberg (page does not exist)"),
who, along with his colleagues, unanimously voted to name the
seminary "Talbot Theological Seminary." In 1981, the seminary's
name was changed to "Talbot School of Theology" when
[Biola](Biola_University "Biola University") moved from college to
university status. [[1]](http://www.talbot.edu/about/history.cfm)

Today, Talbot is one of the nation's leading evangelical seminaries
and continues to grow with the needs of Christian leaders. Talbot
has approximately 900 students, 52 full-time faculty members, and
offers seven master's degrees and three doctoral degrees. Dennis
Dirks, a Talbot alumnus, is Talbot's fifth and current dean,
serving since 1992. [[2]](http://www.talbot.edu/about/history.cfm)
