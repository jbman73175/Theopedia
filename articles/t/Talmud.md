The **Talmud** is a multi-volume book of Jewish law which expands
upon the
[Mosaic law](index.php?title=Mosaic_law&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mosaic law (page does not exist)")
as given in [Scripture](Scripture "Scripture"). In the traditions
of the
[Jews](index.php?title=Jew&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jew (page does not exist)"),
it was regarded as the Oral Torah. The Talmud was preserved and
transmitted orally until the Middle Ages when
[rabbis](index.php?title=Rabbi&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rabbi (page does not exist)")
were being persecuted and killed in significant numbers. Fearing
that it would be lost, rabbis committed the Talmud to print.

## Form

The form of modern editions of the text follows a fairly regular
pattern: Mishna and Gemara. The Mishna is ostensibly a statement of
a principal from rabbinic law or tradition. A section of
commentary, Gemara, follows. Gemara often takes a vaguely
argumentative tone, as the doctrinal positions of competing schools
may be offered, with the most pithy and clever comment given as a
last word on the subject.

## Interest to Christians

As one of a handful of classes of rabbinic texts, the Talmud
contains a mixture of [exegesis](Exegesis "Exegesis"),
[tradition](index.php?title=Tradition&action=edit&redlink=1 "Tradition (page does not exist)"),
and historical
[commentary](index.php?title=Commentary&action=edit&redlink=1 "Commentary (page does not exist)").
It offers evidence of how rabbis interpreted several
[Messianic prophecies](Messianic_prophecies "Messianic prophecies").
