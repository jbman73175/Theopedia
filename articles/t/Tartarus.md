**Tartarus** comes from the [Greek](Greek "Greek") word *Tartaroo*
which is used only once in the New Testament in 2 Peter 2:4.

"For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them
into hell (Lit. *Tartarus*) and committed them to chains of gloomy
darkness to be kept until the judgment; . . ." (2 Peter 2:4, ESV).
Most English versions, such as the [KJV](KJV "KJV"),
[NASB](NASB "NASB"), [NIV](NIV "NIV"), and [ESV](ESV "ESV"),
translate the word as [Hell](Hell "Hell"). According to
*Thayer’s Greek Definitions*, *Tartaroo* is "the name of the
subterranean region, doleful and dark, regarded by the ancient
Greeks as the abode of the wicked dead, where they suffer
punishment for their evil deeds; it answers to
[Gehenna](Gehenna "Gehenna") of the Jews." John F. Walvoord writes
that the term "is frequently found in Jewish apocalyptic
literature, where it refers to a place even lower than hell where
the wicked are punished."^[[1]](#note-0)^

In Greek mythology, Tartarus is a place in the underworld — even
lower than [Hades](Hades "Hades"). In Roman mythology, Tartarus is
the place where enemies of the gods are sent. Virgil describes it
in the *Aeneid* as a gigantic place, the deepest part of the
underworld, surrounded by the flaming river Phlegethon and triple
walls to prevent its tormented captives from escaping.
