**Tatian** (110-180) was an early Christian apologist, probably
born in Syria. "He was a pupil of
[Justin Martyr](Justin_Martyr "Justin Martyr"). After his master’s
death, he left Christianity, becoming an Encratitic
[Gnostic](Gnosticism "Gnosticism") — i.e., he regarded all matter
as evil and denied the salvation of Adam. While a Christian, he
wrote *Oratio ad Graecos* (Address to the Greeks) (152–55), a
defense of Christianity bolstered by a bitter attack on Greek arts,
philosophers, and institutions, and the *Diatessaron*, a harmony of
the four Gospels that was long the only life of Jesus available in
Syria." (*The Columbia Encyclopedia*, Sixth Edition)
