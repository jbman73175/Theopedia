**Teetotalism** is the principle or practice of complete abstinence
from alcoholic beverages. A person who practices this is a
**teetotaler**.[1](http://wiki.tatet.ru/en/Teetotalism.html)

In [Christianity](Christianity "Christianity") this is attributed
to groups of Christians who believe that drinking alcohol is a sin
in that it detracts from our walk with
[Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ").

## Is Teetotalism Legalistic?

"Legalism is a more dangerous disease than alcoholism because it
doesn't look like one. Alcoholism makes men fail; legalism helps
them succeed in the world. Alcoholism makes men depend on the
bottle; legalism makes them self-sufficient, depending on no one.
Alcoholism destroys moral resolve; legalism gives it strength.
Alcoholics don't feel welcome in church; legalists love to hear
their morality extolled in church. Therefore, what we need in this
church is not front end regulations to try to keep ourselves pure.
We need to preach and pray and believe that "Neither circumcision
nor uncircumcision, neither teetotalism nor social drinking,
neither legalism nor alcoholism is of any avail with God, but only
a new creation (a new heart)" (Gal. 6:15; 5:6)." -
