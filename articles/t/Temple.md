A model of the Temple.
The chief characteristic of a **temple** in
[Biblical theology](Biblical_theology "Biblical theology") is that
it is the dwelling-place of a god. The Temple at
[Jerusalem](Jerusalem "Jerusalem"), thought of as great house of
the God of Israel, is a key part of the history of
[Israel](Israel "Israel"), and a major theme in the storyline of
the [Bible](Bible "Bible").

## Temples before Solomon

[Solomon](Solomon "Solomon") is rightly credited as the first
builder of a temple of God in Jerusalem, but temples to
[Israel's God](Yahweh "Yahweh") appear in the Biblical narrative
prior to the construction in Jerusalem. The
[tabernacle](Tabernacle "Tabernacle"), which travelled with Israel
during the days of the [Exodus](Exodus "Exodus"), provided the same
point of reference for the Israelite *cultus* which the Temple was
later to provide.

When the people of Israel entered the land of Canaan and had
subdued it, the tabernacle appears to have acquired a more
permanent residence in
[Shiloh](index.php?title=Shiloh&action=edit&redlink=1 "Shiloh (page does not exist)")
(Jos. 18:1, Jer. 7:12). It is here that the
[books of Samuel](Books_of_Samuel "Books of Samuel") open, with
Hannah and
[Eli](index.php?title=Eli&action=edit&redlink=1 "Eli (page does not exist)")
the priest in "the temple of Yahweh", a designation which seems
aimed at asserting the kingship of Yahweh over Israel and his
supremacy over the surrounding nations' gods.

The psalms also make reference to the temple of God, some written
by David. These speak of seeking Yahweh in his temple, and look
forward to the day when God's temple will be in Jerusalem.

## Solomon's Temple

In [2 Samuel](2_Samuel "2 Samuel")
[7](index.php?title=2_Samuel_7&action=edit&redlink=1 "2 Samuel 7 (page does not exist)"),
we see [David](David "David"), who has just seen the entry of the
[Ark of the Covenant](Ark_of_the_Covenant "Ark of the Covenant")
into Jerusalem, propose to build a house for Yahweh. He was told
through the prophet
[Nathan](index.php?title=Nathan&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nathan (page does not exist)")
that his task was to fight for Israel's peace, but that Yahweh
would establish David's house, and one from his line would build
the house he wanted to build. Solomon, not even yet conceived, was
the direct fulfillment of this promise.

The building of the Temple under Solomon spared no expense to
provide a house for Yahweh, the covenant god of Israel. This Temple
served as the headquarters for the priestly order, the place for
true worship of Yahweh, and the visible sign of his presence with
Israel.

Throughout the following turbulent history of Israel, the Temple
was one of the fixed reference points for Israel. The
[priests](Priest "Priest") ministered in it, the
[prophets](Prophet "Prophet") invoked it, and the
[kings](index.php?title=King&action=edit&redlink=1 "King (page does not exist)")
sought Yahweh in it. The Temple's gold was frequently used by
Israel's kings in emergencies to assuage belligerent neighbours,
although the Egyptians and Babylonians also plundered the Temple in
war. It is the second of these events which was to be the end of
the history of the Temple built by Solomon:
[Nebuchadnezzar](index.php?title=Nebuchadnezzar&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nebuchadnezzar (page does not exist)")
ransacked the Temple twice, carrying off the sacred objects and
burning what remained to the ground.

In his account, the
[Chronicler](Books_of_Chronicles "Books of Chronicles") refuses to
leave the story there, for Yahweh had spoken through the prophets
Isaiah and Jeremiah, who foretold of
[Cyrus](index.php?title=Cyrus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cyrus (page does not exist)")
and his edict, that he would say "of the temple, 'Your foundation
shall be laid.'" (Isa. 44:28)

## The Second Temple

The Edict of Cyrus, and subsequent confirmatory edicts, gave the
Jews the charge to rebuild Jerusalem, including the Temple. The
work was led by [Ezra](Ezra "Ezra") and
[Nehemiah](index.php?title=Nehemiah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nehemiah (page does not exist)"),
and overseen by Zerubbabel. Although it met opposition from
surrounding nations, the people worked to re-build the Temple.
After the foundation had been laid, the people rejoiced, although
many of those who were older wept, because they had seen the former
Temple (Ezr. 3:12). We suppose that this is because the Second
Temple was not more glorious than the first. However, Yahweh spoke
to Zerubbabel through the prophet
[Haggai](index.php?title=Haggai&action=edit&redlink=1 "Haggai (page does not exist)"),
and promised that one day, when the Desire of all nations came, he
would fill the Temple with glory to make its glory greater than
that of the former house of the LORD [2:6–9].

The subsequent history of the Second Temple, recorded by the
Apocrypha and secular historians, was no less chequered than that
of the first. It was rendered unclean by the Greek king Antiochus
Epiphanes, sparking the Maccabean revolt, and knocked down and
expanded under Herod the Great into the Temple complex known by
Jesus and the disciples.

## The Temple in the prophets

As already mentioned, the Old Testament prophets frequently invoked
the Temple of Yahweh in their teaching.

## The Temple in New Testament theology and beyond

The Temple features heavily in the gospel accounts, both as a
literary device and a setting.
[John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John")'s gospel opens by telling
us that the Word became flesh and "tabernacled" among us, while
[Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke")'s gospel starts with
[Zechariah](index.php?title=Zechariah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Zechariah (page does not exist)")
in the Temple, and concludes with the first Christians worshipping
there. Of course, all four gospels record the events of
[Easter](Easter "Easter") week, which were focussed on the Temple.

### Jesus and the Temple

*The Purification of the Temple* by El Greco (1541–1614).
Although the Temple naturally featured in the life of
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") prior to his public ministry, we will focus
on how Jesus interacted with the Temple during his time in
Jerusalem, the last week of his life, where the majority of that
interaction occurred.

The Temple appears in Jesus' teaching just prior to the
[Olivet discourse](index.php?title=Olivet_discourse&action=edit&redlink=1 "Olivet discourse (page does not exist)")
and, some commentators will argue, during it. The disciples point
out to Jesus the grandeur of
[Herod](index.php?title=Herod&action=edit&redlink=1 "Herod (page does not exist)")'s
edifice, to which Jesus responds "Truly, I say to you, there will
not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown
down." (Matt. 24:1) Within the Discourse, there is a reference to
an "abomination that causes desolation" [24:15–28], which is
language drawn from [Daniel](Book_of_Daniel "Book of Daniel")'s
prophecy of a desolation of the Temple [11:31]. Commentators differ
on why Jesus chooses to use this phrase, although the most natural
reading would seem to be that this refers in some way to the
subsequent history and particularly the Temple's end.

The most known and studied incident, of course, is the one termed
the "Purification of the Temple"^[[1]](#note-0)^. Rightly regarded
as one of the most significant interactions of Jesus with the
Temple, we see Jesus casting out traders and pronouncing judgment.
The two major schools of thought have been that, on the one hand,
Jesus was attempting to purify (or to announce the purification of)
the Temple system; and on the other hand, that Jesus was
symbolically destroying the Temple system. Taking the near context
of this incident in the synoptic gospels (the withered fig tree in
Matthew and Mark, weeping over Jerusalem in Luke), we may suppose
that Jesus was enacting a destructive judgment rather than a
purificatory one, but either way, this action is most definitely a
judgment.

He caused immense outrage among the religious authorities, and this
incident proved to be the immediate cause for the plotting against
Jesus' life (Mark 11:18). However, Jesus was not aiming directly to
provoke the authorities; he was taking aim at the entire Temple
system. The Temple, for so long the focal point of Jewish national
life, had been warped and twisted by the nation: that which was
originally given as an
[annual reminder](index.php?title=Sacrifice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sacrifice (page does not exist)")
of sins had been turned into a badge of righteousness; that which
exposed the people before a holy God had become an attempted
defence against that same holy God; and now that the messenger of
the covenant, the desire of all nations, had come, he was despised
and rejected.

It is in the context of this judgment against the Temple that Jesus
utters his famous prophecy, "Destroy this temple and I will raise
it up again in three days."^[[2]](#note-1)^ As John explains, by
this Jesus was referring to his body, and to the Resurrection.
Matthew tells us that Jesus said of himself that "one greater than
the Temple is here" (Matt. 12:6). These words are self-explanatory:
the presence of God with man, signified for so long by the Temple,
has been revealed in Jesus Christ. No longer is there a need for
elaborate ceremonies and ritual purifications, for God has come to
earth, and walks among us. God's presence with man, a promise for
so long, has been fulfilled in Jesus Christ.

Finally, at the [crucifixion](Crucifixion "Crucifixion"), the
curtain of the Temple, symbolising the separation between God and
man, was torn in two (Matt. 27:51, Mark 15:38, Luke 23:45).

### The New Testament and the Temple

Temple worship practices feature in various parts of the New
Testament, particularly in Paul and Revelation. Worth mentioning in
this connection is the epistle to the Hebrews, whose author is
focussing on tabernacle worship as opposed to Temple worship, but
the similarities are sufficient to warrant consideration here.

### The end of the Temple

In
[AD 70](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(70) "w:Siege of Jerusalem (70)"),
the Roman armies of Titus sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the
Temple, directly fulfilling Jesus' words in Matthew 24.

## Notes

1.  [↑](#ref-0) There is a body of opinion which holds to two
    Temple cleansings, on the basis that this incident occurs at the
    beginning of John's gospel but the end of the Synoptists'. We will
    treat all four reports together since, even should this notion
    prove correct, the message of John's account is not thoroughly
    dissimilar from that of the Synoptists.
2.  [↑](#ref-1) Only John [2:19] records these words as coming from
    Jesus. Mark [14:57–59] implies that he said this, while Matthew
    [26:61] is content to leave the charge with the false witnesses.
    Luke, presumably as he is writing for Gentiles, does not record
    these words at all.
