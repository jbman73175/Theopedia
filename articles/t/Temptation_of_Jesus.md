"No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good.
A silly idea is current that good people do not know what
temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to
resist temptation know how strong it is. After all, you find out
the strength of the German army by fighting against it, not by
giving in. You find out the strength of a wind by trying to walk
against it, not by lying down. A man who gives in to temptation
after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been
like an hour later. That is why bad people, in one sense, know very
little about badness. They have lived a sheltered life by always
giving in. We never find out the strength of the evil impulse
inside us until we try to fight it: and Christ, because he was the
only man who never yielded to temptation, is also the only man who
knows to the full what temptation means--the only complete
realist." [C.S. Lewis](C.S._Lewis)
