The **Ten Commandments**, also called the **Decalogue** (Lit.
*ten words*), form the moral foundation of the law given by God to
the ancient people of [Israel](Israel "Israel") through
[Moses](Moses "Moses") in the form of two stone tablets. The
commandments are listed in Exodus 20:3-17 and again in Deuteronomy
5:7-21.

# God's authority

In the preamble to the Ten Commandments. Moses asserts God's
authority for imposing them, as follows (Deut 5: 2-5):

-   The Lord had made a [covenant](Covenant "Covenant") with the
    Israelites at Horeb,
-   The covenant was with the very people that Moses was speaking
    with, not even with their parents,
-   The Lord had spoken to the Israelites
    [face to face](Theophany "Theophany") out of the fire on the
    mountain, so dramatically in fact that they had asked Moses to
    stand between them and the Lord for fear of death (Exodus 20:19),
-   They owed the Lord their allegiance, as he had brought them out
    of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.

# The commandments

The commandments are listed in Exodus 20:3-17 and again in
Deuteronomy 5:7-21. Neither text actually provides numbers for the
individual commandments, which has allowed for three main numbering
traditions:
