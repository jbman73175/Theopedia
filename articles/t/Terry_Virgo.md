## Quotes

"Anyone in newfrontiers would know how much we treasure these
doctrines. I am not sure that someone would feel they couldn't join
us if they were not reformed. We have never said you have to be
reformed to belong. But it is widely known and understood outside
our circles that we are reformed and charismatic. That's how people
see us. I have often said that I don't know how people who don't
fully believe in the sovereignty of God can sleep peacefully at
night . . .

The Bible is full of language about fathers, sons, brothers, named
people. Even when Paul writes to the Romans he mentions people who
are dear friends, who are co-laborers. The atmosphere is like a
family. The whole structure is relational. The essential Apostolic
doctrine is followed by a lifestyle which is very transparent, full
of tenderness, mercy, forgiveness and affection. Its about building
churches that are flooded with the Holy Spirit's presence and
genuine integrity of relationship. Into those churches the truth is
taught and from them the truth is proclaimed to the world."

"Today, many Christians still live secular lives, attend church but
have a privatized religion and a 'personal savior' instead of being
captivated by the fact that we are God's people and are therefore
at the centre of world history . . .

What thrills me is a local church full of individuals celebrating
the triumph of grace, knowing what it is to be a son of God, full
of the Holy Spirit, enjoying personal fellowship with God in an
intimate way and also reveling in a huge picture of our world
mission to glorify Jesus among the nations, and the vast place of
the Church in world history. That vision is both intimately
personal and massively broad -- both things thrill me."
