Tertullian
**Tertullian** (ca. 150-225), classified as one of the
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers"),
was a notable early Christian
[apologist](Apologetics "Apologetics"). He was born in the city of
Carthage in North Africa. Both of his parents were pagan, and his
father was a centurion. Tertullian received a thorough education in
the knowledge of the Romans and the Greeks, and he apparently
practiced law in Rome before his return to Carthage and conversion.
His writings indicate that he did not become a Christian until he
was in his thirties or forties.

## Biographical sketch

Once Tertullian converted to Christianity, he held nothing back. He
used his vast learning in the cause of Christ. At the risk of his
life, he wrote several works to the Romans, defending Christianity
and attempting to persuade the authorities to halt their senseless
persecution.

Tertullian apparently served as an elder or presbyter in Carthage,
completely devoting his life to the ministry of Christ. Not only
did he write apologetic works to the Romans, but he also composed a
considerable number of writings in which he defended orthodox
Christianity against various heretics. Tertullian also wrote
exhortations for the Church itself. He lived during an era in which
the Church was coming to grips with the reality that Christ had not
returned within the expected time frame of the earliest Christians.
Tertullian often felt that the leadership of the Church was growing
complacent as it sought to find its place in a secular world which
would be its home for the long haul. ^[[1]](#note-0)^A number of
his works speak out against capitulating not only to the direct
pressures of Roman persecution but while the Church waits for
Christ that it should not trade hope in God for dependency in the
power of the Empire, including its economic, political and military
power. Like Paul, he rejected earthly power and advantage,
including worldly education and social rank as "dung" in relation
to the things of Christ, even concluding that Christian
discipleship was incompatible with military service.

Until the time of Tertullian nearly all Christian works had been
written in Greek. Although Tertullian was fluent in Greek and wrote
several works in Greek, he penned most of his works in Latin--in
order to benefit the growing number of western Christians who knew
only Latin. This effort has often earned him the title of "The
Father of Latin Christianity." In this effort Tertullian often
developed Latin terminology to express ideas of christian theology
that had previously been unique to the Greek language. He is well
known for being the first to use the words "substance" and "person"
to define God.^[[2]](#note-1)^

Because of his fiery temperament and forceful convictions, nearly
all of Tertullian's writings have polemic overtones. Church
historian Phillip Schaff said of him: "He resembled a foaming
mountain torrent rather than a calm, transparent river in the
valley. His vehement temper was never fully subdued, although he
struggled sincerely against it. He was a man of strong convictions,
and never hesitated to express them without fear or favor. ...His
polemics everywhere leave marks of blood. It is a wonder that he
was not killed by the heathens, or excommunicated by the
Catholics." [Philip Schaff, *History of the Christian Church*, vol.
2 (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1910), pp. 822-824].

In his later years, having become ever more disturbed with the
complacency he saw within the Church's leadership, Tertullian
joined the charismatic [Montanist](Montanism "Montanism") sect. His
attraction to the Montanists was that they shared many of his views
regarding that aforementioned ecclesial complacency, as well as a
strict moralism fueled by their maintenance of the early Christian
hope in the imminent return of Christ. It is unfortunate that in
subsequent decades after Tertullian's death the Montanists became
extremely radical, if not outrightly heretical, causing latter
theolgians to often dismiss him and his works.

Tertullian’s *Apology (Apologeticus)* is one of the best-known
works of the pre-Nicene era. In it, he provides not only a stirring
defense of Christianity to the Roman rulers, but takes exhaustive
measures to show that Roman culture and religion is inferior and
hopeless when compared to Christianity.

## Relation of Jerusalem with Athens

In chapter 7 of his work
*De praescriptione haereticorum (On the prescription of heretics)*
he asks "What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?", which scholars and
others now frequently quote. For Tertullian, it was part of a
larger argument on how to deal with those who claim to be
Christians (i.e., believers in Jesus), but in truth don't accept
the authority of scripture, only their own powers of reason (i.e.,
the philosophy of Athens). ^[[3]](#note-2)^
