The term **Textus Receptus** is Latin meaning "Received Text". It
comes from the preface to the second edition of a
[Greek](Greek "Greek")
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") published by the
brothers Elzevir in 1633. In this preface the Elzevirs wrote,
*Textum ergo habes, nunc ab omnibus receptum: in quo nihil immutatum aut corruptum damus*
-- “What you have here, is
**the text which is now received by all**, in which we give nothing
changed or corrupted.”^[[1]](#note-0)^ From this statement comes
the term Textus Receptus or TR, which today is commonly applied to
all editions of the printed Greek NT before the Elzevir’s,
beginning with Dutch humanist
[Desiderius Erasmus](Desiderius_Erasmus "Desiderius Erasmus")
(1496-1536) and his first published edition in 1516.

## Background

Erasmus was the author of five published editions from 1516 to
1535. His consolidated Greek text was based on only seven minuscule
manuscripts of the Byzantine text type that he had access to in
Basel at the time, and he relied mainly on two of these - both
dating from the twelfth century.^[[2]](#note-1)^

Although many point to obvious limitations and certain
short-comings in Erasmus' first Greek text, later editors used it
as their starting point, making minor revisions as needed based on
additional Greek manuscript evidence.

Robert Estienne (known as Stephanus) (1503-1559) edited and printed
four editions from 1546 to 1551. His third edition of 1550 was the
first to have a critical apparatus, with references to the
Complutensian Polyglot and fifteen additional Greek manuscripts.
The fourth edition of 1551 had the same Greek text as the third,
but is especially noteworthy for its division of the NT books into
chapters and verses, a system still in use today.^[[3]](#note-2)^

[Theodore Beza](Theodore_Beza "Theodore Beza") (1519-1605)
published four independent editions from 1565 to1604. His text was
essentially a reprinting of Stephanus’ third edition (1550) with
minor changes.

The third edition of Stephanus (1550) became the standard form of
the Greek NT text in England and that of the Elzevirs (1633) on the
continent.^[[4]](#note-3)^ The Stephanus 1550 text as given in
Beza’s edition of 1598 was the main source for translators of the
1611 King James Version of the Bible.

## Scrivener's Textus Receptus (1881)

The Scrivener 1881 text was produced by Frederick Henry Ambrose
Scrivener in an attempt to reconstruct the Greek text underlying
the King James or Authorized Version of 1611.^[[5]](#note-4)^

The KJV translators never published the Greek text from which they
worked, so Scrivener attempted to reverse-engineer the text by
examining the various texts that would have been available to them.
Scrivener merely matched various readings (primarily the Beza and
Stephanus texts) to fit the English used by the KJV translators.
Thus the Scrivener text properly belongs to the family of Textus
Receptus.

In several places, the 1611 KJV translators apparently depended
upon readings from the Latin Vulgate for which there was no
supporting Greek text and in these cases Scrivener followed the
closest Greek reading possible. Therefore Scrivener's text does not
quite perfectly conform to the KVJ text, although it is perhaps the
closest that could have been done without having to rely on Latin
readings lacking Greek manuscript authority.

This Scrivener 1881 text is supposedly identical to the 1894
edition which was published posthumously and has been reprinted by
the Trinitarian Bible Society. There is no single Greek manuscript
that represents the Textus Receptus, for the more than 30 varieties
of the Textus Receptus were all eclectic texts formed by
incorporating variant readings.

## Notes

1.  [↑](#ref-0) The Elzevirs printed seven editions of the Greek NT
    between 1624 and 1678. Unlike the editions of Erasmus, Estienne,
    and Beza before them, the Elzevirs were not editors of the editions
    attributed to them, only the printers. Ref. J. Harold Greenlee,

    verses was the Geneva Bible published in 1560. These verse
    divisions soon gained acceptance as a standard way to notate
    verses, and have since been used in virtually all English Bibles.
