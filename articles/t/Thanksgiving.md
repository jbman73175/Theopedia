**Thanksgiving** is an annual one-day holiday to return thanks for
the abundant blessings of God. Traditionally held at the close of
the harvest season, it has been designated in the US (since 1941)
on the fourth Thursday of November and in Canada on the second
Monday in October. These annual celebrations have their history
rooted in harvest festivals and feasts celebrated by early settlers
and explorers and particularly in the well-documented Thanksgiving
held by the colonists at Plymouth in 1621.
