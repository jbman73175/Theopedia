The **Acts 29 Network** (A29) is a peer to peer church planting
network composed of pastors from around the nation and world whose
dream is to help qualified leaders called by God plant new churches
and replant declining churches. The gospel has the power to
transform lives, and indeed our culture. The goal of the Acts 29
Network is to plant churches that effectively reach the emerging
generation. To accomplish this, young leaders need to be equipped
with a solid theological understanding of the gospel.
