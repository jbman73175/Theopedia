The **Angelical Salutation**, or **Hail Mary**, is probably one of
the best known prayers unique to
[Catholicism](Catholicism "Catholicism"). It recounts the words
used by the Angel Gabriel when saluting [Mary](Mary "Mary") in the
[Gospel of Luke](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke"), and ends with a
request that Mary prays to [God](God "God") for the penitent sinner
now and in the hour of their death. The Angelical Salutation is
also one of the central prayers in
[Mariology](Mariology "Mariology"), and one of the two prayers used
with the
[Rosary](index.php?title=Rosary&action=edit&redlink=1 "Rosary (page does not exist)").
