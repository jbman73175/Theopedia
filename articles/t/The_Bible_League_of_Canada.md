## History

In 1948, The Bible League of Canada began as the Canadian affiliate
of the American Home Bible League. Throughout the 1950s, the
affiliate organization distributed Bibles door-to-door through
local churches and various outreach ministries, although the
organization was suffering financially. The organization's
financial situation began to change in 1959 when Jo Vander Boom was
appointed to manage the organization's activities. In 1960, Jo's
husband, John Vander Boom, was appointed as the first Canadian
directory and officially changed the name of the organization to
the Canadian Home Bible League in 1962^[[2]](#note-1)^. In 1971,
the organization was incorporated and became a legal entity
separate from the American Home Bible League. The same year, an
office in Weston, Ontario became the first purchased property, and
an appeal for Cuba became the organization's first international
project. Vander Boom formed a group of prominent evangelical church
leaders who lent their endorsements to the ministry of the Canadian
Home Bible League. This action started the attainment of
interdenominational support which continues to influence The Bible
League of Canada today. On December 11, 1984 the name of the
organization was changed to the World Home Bible League of Canada,
reflecting the organization's increasing commitment to
international ministry. The present name, The Bible League of
Canada, became official in 1992. In 1994, offices were moved to the
present location in Burlington, Ontario. In 2007, the organization
began operating its own international ministries apart from the
U.S. Bible League operations.

## Funding

The Bible League of Canada’s revenue comes from individual donors,
churches, corporations, foundations, and BFM Thrift Stores. In
2009, 5.11% of its funding was spent on administration and 3.88%
was spent on fund-raising.^[[3]](#note-2)^

## Activities

The Bible League of Canada provides Bibles and community training
worldwide by partnering with churches and mission organizations in

organizations.^[[4]](#note-3)^
