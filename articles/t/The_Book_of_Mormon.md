**The Book of Mormon** is an extra-Biblical text of
[Mormonism](Mormonism "Mormonism"). It is claimed that
[Joseph Smith](Joseph_Smith "Joseph Smith"), the founder of
Mormonism, translated golden plates and the result of this work was
the *Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ* (hereafter
BoM). First published in 1830, the BoM has gone through many
changes involving grammar, name corrections, and even some
[doctrinal](Doctrine "Doctrine") changes. The BoM is considered as
inspired scripture in the Mormon church, and thus to LDS has equal,
and arguably more authority than the Bible.

The BoM claims to be a translation of the historical record left by
Hebrew descendants known as the "Nephites" who lived somewhere in
the Americas between about 600 B.C. and 420 A.D.. With regard to
theology, the BoM generally reflects the Protestantism of the early
19th century in America, and contains very few of the doctrinal
distinctives found in the mainstream sect of Mormonism. This makes
the BoM a key component of Mormon marketing. It is freely
distributed and is designed to be the first exposure that many get
to the largest and most popular sect of the Mormon religion.

## Archaeology

Most Mormon apologists and many laymen, in response to DNA
research, BoM demographics, and the Native American traditions
(which do not correlate with the Book of Mormon), hold to a
"limited" geographical model.

"[O]nce you say there were other people here, you say: OK, where
were the Nephites, and how many more people were here. We have all
kinds of other DNA signatures to worry about all of a sudden. It
may be that we never find any Hebrew DNA (whatever that looks like)
in the New World. ... But if we do find some, that's fine; if we
don't find some, that's fine too. There's no way that negative
evidence on that hurts the Book of Mormon whatsoever once you
believe in a limited geography. If you believe in a global
geography, you're basically done, toasted, game over." -John Clark

Archeological Foundation, BYU)

Others hold to the traditional archaeological model of the Book of
Mormon. This is either held as a traditional belief, or in appeal
to the Mormon organization's historic, consistent stance (from the
beginning for over 100 years) on the Native Americans as Lamanites.
Also of interest to those who hold this position is an incident
where a group with Smith came upon bones, which Smith prophetically
declared to belong to a white Lamanite named Zelph who had fought a
great battle for the Nephites.

"...the visions of the past being opened to my understanding by the
Spirit of the Almighty, I discovered the person whose skeleton was
before us was a white Lamanite, a large, thick-set man, and a man
of God. His name was Zelph ... who was known from the Hill Cumorah,
or eastern sea to the Rocky mountains." (History of the Church,
1948 ed., II: 79-80)
The introduction to the Book of Mormon, since 1981, describes the
Lamanites as, "the principal ancestors of the American Indians."

## Quotes

-   "If belief in the *Book of Mormon* was a prerequisite to
    joining the Church, it was a belief in the book's divine origin
    rather than the doctrinal content of the book. The *Book of Mormon*
    taught nothing different from what early 19th-century religious
    seekers would have already been familiar with. The theology of the
    *Book of Mormon* was [monotheistic](Monotheism "Monotheism"). Early
    Mormon theology then would not have been unique in comparison to
    other beliefs of the day." -Kurt Widmer,
    *Mormonism and the Nature of God: A Theological Evolution, 1830-1915*
-   "I would never tell anybody to try to prove the Book of Mormon
    is true through physical evidence, just because of the way
    metaphysics and epistemology workâ€”it's not possible. And so, you
    have to get the testimony some other way, and then the evidence
    will become very clear." -John E. Clark (Professor of Anthropology
    and Director of the New World Archeological Foundation, BYU)
