**The Confessional Presbyterian** is a relatively new journal with
a goal to provide a forum for ecumenical discussion among
conservative Presbyterians of different denominations wishing to
defend closer adherence to the Westminster Confession of Faith and
Catechisms. This journal is published annually and overseen by a
board of contributing editors from several denominations, including
the
[Presbyterian Church in America](Presbyterian_Church_in_America "Presbyterian Church in America"),
[Orthodox Presbyterian Church](Orthodox_Presbyterian_Church "Orthodox Presbyterian Church"),
Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church and the Reformed
Presbyterian Church of North America.
