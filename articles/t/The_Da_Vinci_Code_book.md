***The Da Vinci Code*** is an adventure novel by Dan Brown
(Doubleday, 2003) in which a man and a woman seek the Holy Grail by
following a trail of clues composed by a secret society called "The
Priory of Sion." They are hounded throughout by a corrupt group
within the French police and by the Vatican "secret service,"
including a monk with a license to kill. The author interrupts the
novel in mid-chase to build an absurd conspiracy theory asserting
that the Jesus of Christianity is a lie promulgated by the Church
to consolidate its power. According to that conspiracy theory:

-   the "true religion" that Jesus believed in was a *gnostic*
    fertility cult, and
-   the "Holy Grail" is the "royal bloodline" of direct descendents
    of a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

Although the novel fails on many levels ^[[1]](#note-0)^, and is
ridiculed by many biblical scholars, there is anecdotal evidence
that it has succeeded in persuading many previously-neutral
non-believers to be skeptical of the Bible and suspicious of the
Church. A 2006 survey, for example, found that seventeen percent of
Canadians "think Jesus's death on the cross was faked and that he
married and had a family." ^[[2]](#note-1)^

## Fertility cult as true religion

In *The Da Vinci Code* there is no higher form of spirituality than
the ancient [gnostic](Gnosticism "Gnosticism") fertility cults:

> Physical union with the female remained the sole means through
> which man could become spiritually complete and ultimately achieve
> *gnosis* -- knowledge of the divine. Since the days of Isis, sex
> rites had been considered man's only bridge from Earth to Heaven .
> . .   
> The ability of the woman to produce life from her womb made her
> sacred. A god. Intercourse was the revered union of the two halves
> of the human spirit -- male and female -- through which the male
> could find spritual wholeness and communion with God. (Chapter 74)

A featured scene in Chapter 74 describes what Brown calls a "deeply
sacrosanct ceremony" where participants, dressed in black and white
robes and wearing masks, stand in a circle and chant while watching
a masked man and woman copulate on a low altar in the center of the
circle.

Religions based on ritual sex are very old. Scripture indicates
that sex-worship of this type occurred in Old Testament times (e.g.
Genesis 38:21), was apparently commonplace among Israel's
neighbouring tribes, and was profoundly unacceptable to God. The
people of God were to have no part in such cults (e.g. Deuteronomy
23:17, Numbers 25:1-3, and 1 Samuel 2:22-25) and sex in the
sanctuary was "an abomination" (Ezekiel 23
[NIV](New_International_Version "New International Version")).
Christians see, in this, God at work drawing his chosen people away
from primitive, flesh-centered, self-fulfilling forms of religion
in preparation for sending his Son into that society to redeem the
whole world.

Need it be said that a fertility cult of this type would be
unthinkable blasphemy to a pious young Jewish man in first century
Palestine? This was, after all, a society where young women would
be subject to public disgrace just for getting pregnant out of
wedlock (Matthew 1:19). Jesus, a Jew, would not have taken part in
any of these activities and there is no evidence at all to suggest
otherwise.

## Jesus according to *The Da Vinci Code*

Much of the energy of Brown's book is devoted to attacking
[church history](Church_history "Church history") and promoting a
false view of [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ"). Brown's
strategy in these attacks is clearly revealed in the middle of the
book, when "Teabing" introduces "Sophie" to the *secret truths*:

> "To fully understand the Grail," Teabing continued, "we must first
> understand the Bible. How well do you know the New Testament?"   
> Sophie shrugged. "Not at all, really. I was raised by a man who
> worshipped Leonardo da Vinci."   
> Teabing looked both startled and pleased. "An enlightened soul.
> Superb! . . ." (Chapter 55)

Sadly it can be safely assumed that, like Sophie in the novel, most
of Brown's readers are not well-versed on the content of the Bible
or the history of the Christian church. Biblically literate readers
and biblical scholars alike do not take this book seriously.

The core elements of Brown's christology are explained in Chapters
55 and 56:

-   Jesus was human, not divine -- which in reality is the old
    [Arian](Arianism "Arianism") heresy.
-   The Roman emperor Constantine engineered a take-over of
    Christianity in 325 AD by convening the
    [First Council of Nicaea](Ecumenical_councils "Ecumenical councils").
-   Until Constantine, Christians viewed Jesus as only mortal.
-   Constantine "stole Jesus from His original followers" and
    "turned Jesus into a deity" to solidify the "new Vatican power
    base."
-   The church subsequently invented the Genesis creation story,
    where man is created first, as a way to disempower women: "Sadly,
    Christian philosophy decided to embezzle the female's creative
    power by ignoring biological truth and making *man* the Creator. .
    . Genesis was the beginning of the end for the Goddess." (Chapter
    56)
-   The church has fought continually since Constantine to suppress
    the "true religion" of the fertility cult and thus to suppress
    women.

## Is The DaVinci Code Heresy?

There is no evidence that Dan Brown speaks from within the
Christian Church, nor have any Christian authorities endorsed his
book, so is it fair to refer to The DaVinci Code as
"[heresy](Heresy "Heresy")"? Normally, the term *heresy* is
reserved for attacks on the true faith from people claiming to be
within the church.

Dan Brown has, however, based much of his conspiracy theory on
heretical assertions sometimes referred to as the
[Liberal Myth of Christian Origins](Liberal_Myth_of_Christian_Origins "Liberal Myth of Christian Origins").
Those assertions truly are heresy, because they have been taught,
in various forms, in liberal Christian institutions across North
America and Europe for decades.

The novel is thus more properly identified as a "vector"
^[[3]](#note-2)^ for heresies, rather than a heresy in and of
itself.

## Is the DaVinci Code Historical Fiction?

Professor
[Anne Macleod](http://www.hbook.com/exhibit/article_macleod.html)
affirms the following perhaps-obvious statement about the
"historical fiction" literary genre:

"...we can all agree that historical fiction should be good fiction
and good history"
Books in this genre, by convention, embed a fictional plot (perhaps
based on some factual event) within as factual a past world as
possible. Writers are fastidious about getting the historical facts
correct down to the last detail, and readers expect them to be so.

Dan Brown positions the novel squarely in this genre by including
elements such as the following:

-   the promise (in true historical-fiction style) that "all
    descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals
    in this novel are accurate."
-   the historical-fiction trappings of the novel including:

-   settings, and richly detailed descriptions of, classical
    architectural sites such as The Louvre, Temple Church London,
    Rosslyn Chapel, and Westminster Abbey
-   the central use of puzzles and riddles based on historical
    events and people
-   skillful use of classical and ancient "oddities" to enliven the
    text

-   the first-page assertion that the Priory of Sion (a key element
    of the book's "past world") is an historical "fact." More
    specifically that it is a European secret society founded in 1099
    with a membership that includes Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli,
    Victor Hugo, and Leonardo da Vinci.

The novel however breaks covenant with the reader by not being
"subject to normal standards of demonstrable historical evidence
and sound reasoning," which is a core
[convention](http://www.hbook.com/exhibit/article_macleod.html) of
historical fiction. Instead, it uses those well-understood
conventions to deliver historically false material in the guise of
historical facts. The
[real story](http://priory-of-sion.com/posd/posdebunking.html) of
the Priory of Sion, for example, can be summarized as follows:

-   the Priory of Sion was a housing society invented in 1956 by
    André Bonhomme and Pierre Plantard in their home town of
    St-Julien-en-Genevoise, France
-   in the 1950's Bonhomme and Plantard created a mythology for it,
    including the distinguished membership list, using material written
    by Noel Corbu, a restauranteur in the Villa Béthanie
-   Bonhomme appeared on the BBC program "History of a Mystery" in
    1996 (seven years before the publication of Brown's novel) and
    stated "It was four friends who came together to have fun. We
    called ourselves the Priory of Sion because there was a mountain by
    the same name close-by."

The *The da Vinci Code* is thus historical fiction in **form** but
departs from the genre in **content**. The resulting blend of fact
and fiction is dangerously deceptive for all readers, except those
that are well equipped to discern the truth.

## Is the Problem with the Readers?

Brown counters these criticisms by underlining that
*The da Vinci Code* is fiction, and placing the responsibility on
the readers to determine what is true:

"While it is my belief that some of the theories discussed by these
characters may have merit, each individual reader must explore
these characters' viewpoints and come to his or her own
interpretations"
([Dan Brown website](http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html))
Even if Brown was correct in placing the responsibility on the
readers, the reality is that a very large number of readers would
be ill-equipped to read the novel critically, for at least the
following reasons:

-   there is a disturbing inability in our culture to tell fact
    from fiction. Perhaps, as Malcolm Muggeridge suggested, this is
    partially a result of mass media's efforts to "present fantasy in
    terms of reality and reality in terms of fantasy."
-   many people are inexcusably ignorant about what the Bible says.
    Even many educated individuals, who consider themselves to be
    widely read, have very poor biblical literacy.

The readers are not the problem, however. One cannot yell "Fire!"
in a theatre and then blame the ensuing stampede on the poor
fact-checking skills of the patrons.

## As literature and film

The novel has been criticised for the mediocrity of the prose and
the lack of development of the characters, and is thus generally
recognized as a piece of "popular" or "pop historical" fiction
rather than literature. It can be contrasted, for example with
Umberto Eco's novel
[*Foucault's Pendulum*](http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_works_fiction.html),
which also includes references to ancient secret societies,
descriptions of classical architecture and art, and a quest that
follows obscure clues. Even in translation, Eco's novel is more
literary than Brown's.

From the way the *Da Vinci* scenes are set up, one can't help but
suspect that the author had the eventual movie in mind as he wrote
it. That
[film version](http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thedavincicode/)
was released in the spring of 2006.
