**The Fall** is the traditional term referring to the first sin of
Adam and Eve which brought judgment upon both nature and mankind.
Genesis 3:1-24 gives the account of *the Fall* of humanity.
[Sin](Sin "Sin") and [death](Death "Death") entered the world, and
humanity has been affected by it ever since. This came about
because Adam and Eve disobeyed God's commandment not to eat of the
"tree of knowledge of good and evil."

## Before the Fall

Before sin and death entered this world, man reflected the image of
God perfectly. Although each person is still created in the image
of God, it continues to be veiled due to the sinfulness of
humanity. Adam and Eve walked with God and enjoyed perfect
fellowship with him.

## After the Fall

"The effects of this first sin upon our first parents themselves
were (1) "shame, a sense of degradation and pollution; (2) dread of
the displeasure of God, or a sense of guilt, and the consequent
desire to hide from his presence. These effects were unavoidable.
They prove the loss not only of innocence but of original
righteousness, and, with it, of the favour and fellowship of God.
The state therefore to which Adam was reduced by his disobedience,
so far as his subjective condition is concerned, was analogous to
that of the fallen angels. He was entirely and absolutely ruined"
(Hodge's Theology)."

## Why God allowed the Fall

"Commenting on John 9:3, Ryle well remarks: "A deep and instructive
principle lies in these words. They surely throw some light on that
great question, the origin of evil. God has thought fit to allow
evil to exist in order that he may have a platform for showing his
mercy, grace, and compassion. If man had never fallen there would
have been no opportunity of showing divine mercy. But by permitting
evil, mysterious as it seems, God's works of grace, mercy, and
wisdom in saving sinners have been wonderfully manifested to all
his creatures. The redeeming of the church of elect sinners is the
means of 'showing to principalities and powers the manifold wisdom
of God' (Eph. 3:10). Without the Fall we should have known nothing
of the Cross and the Gospel."
