**The Fundamentals** is a twelve volume set of essays outlining
orthodox Christian doctrine that was influential in the early U.S.
[fundamentalist](Fundamentalism "Fundamentalism") movement circa
1910. The books contain ninety essays, many by recognized Christian
scholars of the day, on topics such as basic
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine"), [inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy")
of Scripture, and errors in unorthodox groups such as
[Mormons](Mormonism "Mormonism") and
[Christian Science](Christian_Science "Christian Science"). From
1910 to 1916 they were distributed free of charge, primarily to
churches in the United States, due to a grant from Milton and Lyman
Stewart of Union Oil Company. In 1917 the
[Bible Institute of Los Angeles](Bible_Institute_of_Los_Angeles "Bible Institute of Los Angeles")
reprinted the set in four volumes under the editorship of
evangelist [R. A. Torrey](R._A._Torrey "R. A. Torrey").

Although these books are strongly associated with the
fundamentalist movement, to which they gave their name, they are
for the most part not guilty of the extremism that has come to mark
that movement. Evangelical Christians can read them nearly 100
years later and see in them a moderate and rational statement of
the basics of the faith.

## Historical Context

*The Fundamentals* was written in the years leading up to World War
I, when Germany was unquestionably the intellectual hot-spot of the
planet. Modern physics was emerging in the hands of Germans such as
Einstein and Heisenberg and a new science of psychology was being
promoted by Sigmund Freud. Before the final volume of
*The Fundamentals* was complete, Germany would be the villain in a
desperate war with Europe.

And out of Germany was coming a steady stream of very influential
[liberal](Liberalism "Liberalism") theological thought, much of it
under the banner of
"[Higher Criticism](Higher_Criticism "Higher Criticism")," that
brought into question the core [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") on
which the church has stood for millenia. And it was doing so in the
name of science.

This was seen as a very real threat, a "clear and present danger"
to the souls of the faithful. As Franklin Johnson concludes in one
of the essays:

> The natural view of the Scriptures is a sea which has been rising
> higher for three-quarters of a century. Many Christians bid it
> welcome to pour lightly over the walls which the faith of the
> church has always set up against it, in the expectation that it
> will prove a healthful and helpful stream. It is already a
> cataract, uprooting, destroying, and slaying.

"The Fundamentals" thus came out of a very strong sense of danger.
The main danger, of course, was from the (German) liberal theology,
but it was made more frightening by the growing sense of danger
from Germany in general. Canon
[Dyson Hague](Dyson_Hague "Dyson Hague"), a Canadian Anglican,
reveals both of these in the first essay of *The Fundamentals*:

> "The term Higher Criticism, then, means nothing more than the study
> of the literary structure of the various books of the Bible, and
> more especially of the Old Testament. Now this in itself is most
> laudable. It is indispensable...   
> "How is it, then, that the Higher Criticism has become identified
> in the popular mind with attacks upon the Bible and the
> supernatural character of the Holy Scriptures?  
> "In the first place, the critics who were the leaders, the men who
> have given name and force to the whole movement, have been men who
> have based their theories largely upon their own subjective
> conclusions.   
> "In the second place, some of the most powerful exponents of the
> modern Higher Critical theories have been Germans, and it is
> notorious to what length the German fancy can go in the direction
> of the subjective and of the conjectural. For hypothesis-weaving
> and speculation, the German theological professor is unsurpassed.
> One of the foremost thinkers used to lay it down as a fundamental
> truth in philosophical and scientific enquiries that no regard
> whatever should be paid to the conjectures or hypotheses of
> thinkers, and quoted as an axiom the great Newton himself and his
> famous words, "Non fingo hypotheses": I do not frame hypotheses. It
> is notorious that some of the most learned German thinkers are men
> who lack in a singular degree the faculty of common sense and
> knowledge of human nature..."

*The Fundamentals* remains, however, as far more than a reactionary
document from a difficult point in history. It is, as its subtitle
says, a "testimony to the truth."

## Contents and Authorship

The ninety essays were written by a wide range of authors, mainly
from the United States, but also a large contingent from Canada and
Britain. Most are theologians, most have higher degrees, and most
are men (there is at least one woman author).

Many of the author's names are still recognized for their
foundational influences.

The essays are not strictly arranged, in part because of the way
that they were issued as a series of tracts. They cover the
following topics:

-   an overview of the bible
-   the [inspiration](Inspiration "Inspiration") and inerrancy of
    the bible
-   arguments against [liberalism](Liberalism "Liberalism") and
    higher criticism
-   basics of the Christian faith (sin, atonement, justification,
    grace)
-   denunciations of false churches
-   personal testimonies

## Editorial differences in pre/post 1917 compilations

The original 1910 to 1916 printings divided the articles into 12
paper bound volumes. Printed on each of these covers was "Volume
[Roman Numerals I to XII] Compliments of Two Christian Laymen."
Printings after 1917 divided the articles into 4 hard bound books.
Somewhat confusingly, these four books are called volumes I to IV,
re-dividing the original twelve volumes into four and thus have a
different volume structure but retain the same article structure.
Printed on the first page of each of the four post 1917 books is
[Roman Numberals I to IV] and the new-to-the-1917-edition is the
statement "published by THE BIBLE INSTITUTE of LOS ANGELES."
