Promo postcard from *The Gospel According to John*
***The Gospel According to John*** is a vision of Marchiano
Ministries to produce a word-for-word adaptation of the
[NIV](NIV "NIV")
[Book of John](http://wikible.org/en/Book_of_John "wikible:Book of John").
Bruce Marchiano played the part of Jesus in
*The Visual Bible: Matthew* and had a cameo in
*The Visual Bible: Acts*. Financial hurdles for all of these films,
including
[Visual Bible International's](index.php?title=Visual_Bible_International&action=edit&redlink=1 "Visual Bible International (page does not exist)")
*[The Gospel of John](The_Gospel_of_John_(movie) "The Gospel of John (movie)")*
and
*[The Gospel of Mark](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gospel_of_Mark_(film) "wikipedia:The Gospel of Mark (film)")*,
have hindered production schedules and challenged the future of
these projects, particularly VBI's vision to make the whole Bible
available in film.^[[1]](#note-0)^

A partner of Marchiano Ministries has posted the following on the
official blog:^[[2]](#note-1)^

> The JOHN gospel being produced by MarchMin is not related to the
> former companies or their versions/series and is a new birthing all
> of it's own. So as to the former, they are what they are; and as to
> the new, it is what it is - which is different! ;) I think in this
> world there is plenty of room for more of the presence of God, and
> for more of Gods Word being put out there and come to life on
> screen in a biblical manner no matter how many former versions
> there may be! The Lord put it on Bruce Marchiano's heart to do JOHN
> in the way that he is doing it; MarchMin is being faithful and
> obedient in it, and He will make and is making a way for this
> awesome new film.

A fund drive is currently in progress for the film. Marchiano
Ministries is asking for tax deductable donations on their
website.
