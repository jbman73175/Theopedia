**The Local Church** is a term referring to the religious
organization based on the teachings of its Chinese founder, Witness
Lee (1905-1997). They adopt no public name and among themselves use
only the terms "Lord's recovery" or "local churches" as
descriptions of what they are, not official designations. Local
groups legally incorporate under the term "The Church in" followed
by the official name of the municipality and can be found in phone
books thus. While the "local church" teaches that the Bible is God
inspired, generally only the Recovery Version is used in their
meetings, along with other publications from the Living Stream
Ministry. The Recovery Version, a study Bible, includes outlines,
cross-references and extensive footnotes written by Witness Lee on
almost every page. A main principle of interpretation used by
Witness Lee and reflected in the footnotes is to use the Bible to
interpret the Bible.

Christian writers and watchdog organizations view the teachings of
this group as departing from Christian
[orthodoxy](Orthodoxy "Orthodoxy"), although its adherents contend
they are merely misunderstood and quoted out of context. The
essential teaching of the group is Witness Lee's doctrine of
*mingling*, which is usually defended with a saying borrowed from
[Athanasius](Athanasius "Athanasius"), "God became man that man
could become God." Witness Lee argued that believers would become
God himself, using Psalm 82:6, "Ye are Gods," in support. However,
Athanasius intended that the true Christian was being restored to
the [*image* of God](Image_of_God "Image of God") — as God
originally created man in the garden of Eden — that is, each
Christian is one soul of breath and dust, spirit and flesh (Gen.
2:7) glorifying God.

## Brief History

Adherents of The Local Church claim its beginning in the teachings
of Christian teacher and author, Watchman Nee (1903-1972) who
ministered in China, and whose followers were called by some
western missionaries "The Little Flock" (the name of their hymnal).
In 1952 he was imprisoned for his faith and he remained in prison
until his death in 1972. While Watchman Nee was in prison on
mainland China, he never corroborated Lee's claims that he had been
Nee's coworker or was his successor to the leadership of the Little
Flock.

In 1962, Witness Lee came to the United States claiming to bring
the teachings of Watchman Nee. It was in the U.S. that Lee's
followers subsequently became known as "The Local Church" or "The
Lord's Recovery." Much controversy derived from Lee's leadership
and peculiar teachings.

In keeping with their unofficial designation, they believe and
teach that local churches include all of the believers in their
respective cities. All the adherents, and only adherents, in a
given city comprise "the local church" in that city,and all
Christians meeting elsewhere are apostate.

## Mingling

Witness Lee taught that his adherents could be changed from man to
God through a process he called *mingling.* As the process took
place, the two natures of man and God would mix together, producing
a God-man hybrid like Jesus, according to Lee. This teaching is
usually justified by a saying of
[Athanasius of Alexandria](Athanasius_of_Alexandria "Athanasius of Alexandria"),
an
[early church father](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers"),
that "God became man that man could become God."

In point of fact however, Athanasius specifically ruled out the
possibility of mingling the natures of God and man in Jesus Christ.
For example, regarding Jesus Christ the
[Athanasian Creed](Athanasian_Creed "Athanasian Creed") reads,
*Unus omnino, non confusione substantiae, sed unitate personae,*
meaning "One altogether, not by mingling of the natures, but by the
unity of Person." *Confusione* (< Latin *confundere*) literally
means "pouring together, mixing, mingling; joining
together,"^[[1]](#note-0)^ which is exactly the way that Witness
Lee defines his doctrine of
"mingling".^[[2]](#note-1)^^[[3]](#note-2)^

Thus ironically, Athanasius refuted the doctrine of mingling as
dangerously heretical as early as the 4th century.

## Criticisms

"Growth and controversy developed during the administration of
their second leader, the late Witness Lee, who moved to America in
1962 founding Living Stream Ministry. Among issues drawing
criticism from evangelical Christians is the Local Church's use of
the term "mingling" to describe the relationship between God and
believers (i.e., Christians become both divine and human like
Jesus). Some evangelicals have also charged that the church
compromises the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") doctrine by confusing
the Persons of the Holy Spirit and the Son in a way similar to
[modalism](Modalism "Modalism"). The organization's exclusivity has
also come under fire. According to Lee, each city can and should
have only one church. Denominationalism is seen as of the Devil.
According to critics, the effect is that Lee-led local churches,
usually called by the name of their cities (e.g., the Church in
Anaheim or the Church in Chicago), become the only true expressions
of the Body of Christ. Thus, according to former members, all other
churches or denominations are seen as being outside the will of God
or not true churches at all. The Local Church has also gained a
reputation for threatening legal action to prevent unfavorable
public evaluation of its movement. Even Christian critics have been
targeted, adding to the evidence that they do not consider
believers outside their movement to be true or obedient Christians
(1 Corinthians 6:1-8)." ^[[4]](#note-3)^
