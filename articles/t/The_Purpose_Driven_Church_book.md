## Quotes

-   "I believe that you measure the health or strength of a church
    by its sending capacity rather than its seating capacity." (p. 32)
-   "I feel right at home with entrepreneurial businessmen,
    managers, and professions. In fact, I've noticed that they are
    attracted to my ministry. It's nothing I planned, it's just the way
    God wired me." (p. 176)
-   "Beginning a message with people's felt needs is more than a
    marketing tool! It is based on the theological fact that God
    chooses to reveal Himself to man according to our needs." (p. 295)
