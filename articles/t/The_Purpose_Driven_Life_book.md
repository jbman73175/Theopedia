***The Purpose Driven Life*** is a book written by
[Rick Warren](Rick_Warren "Rick Warren"), pastor of Saddle Back
Church of Lake Forest, CA. Published by Zondervan, it is a
best-seller, having sold more than 22 million copies (As of Arpil,
2005). It has topped the *New York Times* Bestseller list for
nonfiction for the past 115 weeks (as of April 2005). The book
comprises a 40-day course of biblical study, and presents what
Warren believes to be the five biblical principles for a fulfilled
life: [worship](Worship "Worship"),
[fellowship](index.php?title=Fellowship&action=edit&redlink=1 "Fellowship (page does not exist)"),
[discipleship](Discipleship "Discipleship"),
[ministry](index.php?title=Ministry&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ministry (page does not exist)"),
and [evangelism](Evangelism "Evangelism"). The book as of July 2005
has been translated into twelve different languages and continues
as the \#1 best-selling book under the New York Times Advicer
section.

The book is intended to be read as a devotional, with each of the
forty short chapters read on consecutive days. Each chapter
contains a brief at the end with a 'point to ponder', a verse to
meditate on, and a question to ask oneself over the course of the
day. Many people have found this an engaging method of study and
devotion, as the mind is naturally directed to look for answers
when a question is posed.

Rick Warren described his book as an anti self-help book. The first
sentence of the book reads, "It's not about you", and the remainder
of the chapter goes on to explain how the quest for personal
fulfillment and satisfaction can only be found by God's purposes
and not our own. Beginning September 2002, churches across the
United States participated in a "40 Days of Purpose" campaign,
which has since brought Rick Warren to national media attention.

Some in the Christian community have been critical of the book.
[John MacArthur](John_MacArthur "John MacArthur") criticized the
book as pop gospel: "What you've got is a feel-good kind of
approach. This is telling people exactly what they want to hear,
telling people that God agrees with you.... But that is not the
Christian message."

MacArthur, however, seems to be in the minority. A recent survey of
protestant pastors conducted by George Barna (May, 2005) asked
pastors to identify what recent books they had found to be most
helpful to their ministries. *The Purpose Driven* Life was the most
frequent response. [Billy Graham](Billy_Graham "Billy Graham")
endorsed the book upon its publication, ""Make sure you're not
missing the point of your life-read this book! The Purpose Driven
Life will guide you to greatness-through living the Great
Commandment and the Great Commission."

In 2005, Zondervan senior marketing editor Greg Stielstra published
Pyromarketing, which in part described how
*The Purpose Driven Life* was marketed. This led to a dispute with
Rick Warren, who felt that it was inappropriate to associate the
success of his book with marketing, rather than with spiritual
explanations.
