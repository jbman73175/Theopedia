## History

In the 19th Century, Dr
[Horatius Bonar](Horatius_Bonar "Horatius Bonar") had edited a
magazine entitled 'The Quarterly Journal of Prophecy'. On his
death, a Mr John Cox brought out a magazine entitled 'Old Truths'.
When that ceased another magazine entitled 'Perilous Times' was
commenced edited by John Cox and G. T. Hunt.

The Sovereign Grace Advent Testimony was formed after World War I,
when a group of men got together and expressed the view that rather
than leave such vital testimony to magazines, an organisation
should be set up to bear witness to the revealed truth of the
doctrine of free and sovereign grace and the personal,
post-tribulational, pre-millennial return of the Lord Jesus
Christ.

The names of the men who joined together are all given on the
original manifesto, each having signed the document. The Testimony
was started in November, 1918 and the manifesto published early in
1919. Pastor John Hunt Lynn was chosen to be first chairman and Mr
George H. Fromow was elected secretary. Both continued till the
times of their home-call. Mr Lynn was taken at the age of 95 in
February, 1941 and Mr Fromow, aged 85, in April, 1974.

  
In 1919 'Perilous Times' was incorporated into a magazine with a
new title, 'Watching and Waiting'. The magazine continues to be
published by SGAT with the subtitle 'Light For Perilous Times'.
During 2008, 3000 copies of the magazine were distributed during
each quarter throughout various parts of the
world.^[[2]](#note-1)^

George H. Fromow was secretary for over 55 years and in his time
the work spread worldwide. The wording of the manifesto has never
been altered, although, strictly speaking, the land described as
Palestine is now known as [Israel](Israel "Israel").

The present secretary of the Sovereign Grace Advent Testimony, Mr
Stephen A. Toms, took over following Mr Fromow's passing in 1974.
