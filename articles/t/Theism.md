**Theism** affirms both the
[existence](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God "Arguments for the existence of God")
of a [transcendent](Transcendence_of_God "Transcendence of God")
[God](God "God") and one that is involved in
[Creation](Creation "Creation"). Or, according to Webster's
dictionary, it is "belief in the existence of one God viewed as the
creative source of the human race and the world who transcends yet
is immanent in the world."

Theism may be most readily understood in contrast to:

-   [Deism](Deism "Deism") - a belief in a God, but one who is not
    [immanent](Immanence_of_God "Immanence of God") or active in the
    world.
-   [Atheism](Atheism "Atheism") - a belief that there is no God.
-   [Pantheism](Pantheism "Pantheism") - a belief that God is
    everything and everyone, and consequently, that everyone and
    everything is God.
-   [Apatheism](Apatheism "Apatheism") - neither belief nor
    disbelief in a God, considering the issue to be unimportant.

While a strict definition of Theism may not necessarily imply
belief in only one God, it is usually associated with
[Monotheism](Monotheism "Monotheism") rather than
[Polytheism](Polytheism "Polytheism").
