*Never heard of Beza? Don't worry — neither have most 21st century evangelicals. But he is one of the most influential of the Reformers, and may be the clearest proponent of Calvin's teachings after John Calvin's death in 1564.*
**Theodore Beza** (or Theodore de Beza) (1519–1605) was a French
[Protestant](Protestantism "Protestantism") theologian and scholar
who played an important role in the early
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation"). As the successor of John
Calvin, he was closely associated with
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"). He lived most of his adult life
in Switzerland.

## Early years

Beza was born in Vezelay on June 24, 1519 to Pierre de Besze and
Marie Bourdelot. Theodore's mother died when he was only three
years old and so he went off to Paris to be raised by a wealthy
uncle. It was here that he would receive training from the
brightest minds in the city. In 1528, when he was nine, his uncle
sent him to Orleans to study under Melchior Wolmar, a notorious
Greek scholar who would eventually join the Reformed movement.

But Theodore was intent on a career in law — to that end he began
his studies at the University of Orleans and attained his degree
(with honors) in 1539 at only twenty years of age. Returning to
Paris, he turned his attention to the study of literature and also
to romance. He secretly wed Claudine Denosse in 1544, intending to
follow up with a public ceremony when the time was right. He was
attained a high level of fame, with a much-noticed work of poetry
(*Juvenilia*), and he was everywhere considered one of the best
writers of Latin poetry of his time.

But he fell ill and his distress of body, it is reported, revealed
to him his spiritual needs. Gradually he came to the knowledge of
salvation in Christ, which he apprehended with a joyous faith. He
then resolved to sever his connections of the time, and went to
Geneva, the French city of refuge for Evangelicals (adherents of
the Reformation movement), where he arrived with Claudine on
October 23, 1548.

At a loss for immediate occupation, he went to Tübingen to see his
former teacher Wolmar. On his way home he visited Viret at
Lausanne, who at once detained him and brought about his
appointment as professor of Greek at the academy there (Nov.
1549).

While in Lausanne he was petitioned to travel with William Farel to
the German [Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran") princes to plead for the
Waldenses, who suffered at the hands of an outbreak of persecution
in 1557. Beza's noble upbringing gave him an instant credibility
with the nobility and they agreed to intervene.

## Settles in Geneva

The academy in Geneva was organized in 1558 and Beza now assumed
the role of Greek instructor and in March he also assumed the
pastorate of a city church. He would also begin to go out and
intervene for certain members of the nobility who were being
persecuted for their conversion to
[Protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism") and through his
effors he quickly developed a reputation as the most capable
spokesman for the French [Reformation](Reformation "Reformation")
and second in theological abilities only to
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") himself.

Here he occupied at first the chair of Greek in the newly
established academy, and after Calvin's death also that of
theology; besides this he was obliged to preach. He completed the
revision of Olivetan's translation of the New Testament, begun some
years before. In 1559 he undertook another journey in the interest
of the Huguenots, this time to Heidelberg; about the same time he
had to defend Calvin against Joachim Westphal in Hamburg and
Tileman Hesshusen.

More important than this polemical activity was Beza's statement of
his own confession. It was originally prepared for his father in
justification of his course and published in revised form to
promote Evangelical knowledge among Beza's countrymen. It was
printed in Latin in 1560 with a dedication to Wolmar. An English
translation was published at London 1563, 1572, and 1585.
Translations into German, Dutch, and Italian were also issued.

As war broke out between the Prince of Conde (Huguenot Protestant)
and the Duke of Guise (Catholic), Beza found himself in an odd
position. He would serve for seven months with the Huguenot army as
almoner and treasurer until Guise was assasinated on February 18,
1563 thus ending the conflict. Beza and his wife returned to Geneva
in May of the same year to find
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") in poor and declining
health. Calvin would die in May of the following year, so the
intermediate twelve months were spent in preparation for a transfer
of authority from Calvin to Beza. When Calvin did die, Beza
performed the funeral and was elected moderator of the local
presbytery.

## Calvin's successor

Beza was a model of a pastor and theologian who had a deep love and
affection for his parishioners — he had a big picture of the
sovereignty of God, but he also saw the pastoral implications of
such a theology. A great example is in his response to the massacre
on St. Bartholomew's day on August 24, 1572. Beginning in Paris,
and then spreading throughout France, countless Protestants were
murdered or wounded and within a week refugees began showing up in
Geneva seeking asylum. Beza urged his parishioners to care for
their wounded French brethren and to observe a day of prayer and
fasting.

Until 1580 Beza was not only
*moderateur de la compagnie des pasteurs*, but also the real soul
of the great institution of learning at Geneva which Calvin had
founded in 1559, consisting of a gymnasium and an academy. As long
as be lived, Beza was interested in higher education. For nearly
forty years the Protestant youth thronged his lecture-room to hear
his theological lectures, in which he expounded the purest
Calvinistic orthodoxy. As a counselor he was listened to by both
magistrates and pastors.

Soon after the death of Theodore's wife, the Lutheran Count
Frederick of Würtemberg called a conference at Montbéliard in March
21, 1586 as an attempt to bridge the sharp divide between the
[Lutherans](Lutheran "Lutheran") and Calvinists. Beza had been
criticized in his youth for being too accomodating to the Lutheran
parties, but here he made clear the Calvinist position. He did
still attempt some level of civility, offering his hand to Andreä,
the Lutheran delegate, upon departing. But Andreä refused it, and
the unresolved tension was apparent. He would also go on to debate
the Lutherans at the Bern Colloquy in 1588 and gave a theological
thrashing to Samuel Huber, the Lutheran representative.

As Beza's life drew to a conclusion he would lose his hearing and
most of his short-term memory. He gave up his daily preaching
schedule in 1586 and only preached once a week (on Sundays) until
1600.

## Theological works

Although Beza produced numerous secular and historical studies,
inluding a biography of Calvin, they were all surpassed by his
theological productions (contained in *Tractationes theologicae*).
In these Beza appears the perfect pupil or the alter ego of Calvin.
His view of life is deterministic and the basis of his religious
thinking is the predestinate recognition of the necessity of all
temporal existence as an effect of the absolute, eternal, and
immutable will of God, so that even the fall of the human race
appears to him essential to the divine plan of the world. In a most
lucid manner, Beza shows in tabular form the connection of the
religious views which emanated from this fundamental
[supralapsarian](Supralapsarianism "Supralapsarianism") mode of
thought. This he added to his highly instructive treatise
*Summa totius Christianismi*.

## Controversial legacy

Beza has often been maligned by modern historians as a cold-hearted
scholar who twisted the teachings of John Calvin into rigid "high"
Calvinism. But this couldn't be further from the truth. Beza and
Calvin shared an incredible affection for one another, such as
resembles that of Paul and Timothy or Luther and Melancthon. Beza
was an astute theologian and saw the daily implications of his
theology — he saw the persecution that the Huguenots were suffering
in France and willingly left the comfort of home and friends to
intercede for them in the courts of the nobility. And even in his
debates with other Protestants (Lutherans), he always saw them as
brethren with whom he may have disagreed on certain points, but
with whom he shared the bond of Christ. A good example for those of
us who consider ourselves to be inheritors of the Reformed
tradition in the 21st century.
