**Theodore Zahn** (1838-1933) German Lutheran theologian, patristic
scholar (study of
[early church fathers](Early_church_fathers "Early church fathers"))
and [New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") exegete, was
born in Mors, Rhenish Prussia. He taught at the universities of
Goettingen (1865-1877), Kiel (1877-1878), Erlangen (1878-1888 and
1892-1909) and Leipzig (1888-1892). He was the author of many
important monographs and commentaries. Nevertheless, his influence
was underrated because he defended the conservatives in New
Testament studies, opposing the radical critics of the Bible. Among
his leading works was his three-volume
*Introduction to the New Testament* (1897-1899; English translation
1909).
