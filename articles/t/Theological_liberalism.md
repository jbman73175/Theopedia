**Theological liberalism**, sometimes known as
*Protestant Liberalism*, is a theological movement rooted in the
early 19th century German Enlightenment, notably in the philosophy
of [Immanuel Kant](Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant") and the religious
views of
[Friedrich Schleiermacher](Friedrich_Schleiermacher "Friedrich Schleiermacher").
It is an attempt to incorporate modern thinking and developments,
especially in the sciences, into the Christian faith. Liberalism
tends to emphasize ethics over doctrine and experience over
Scriptural authority. While essentially a 19th century movement,
theological liberalism came to dominate the American mainline
churches in the early 20th century. Liberal Christian scholars
embraced and encouraged the
[higher biblical criticism](Biblical_criticism "Biblical criticism")
of modern Biblical scholarship.

Protestant liberal thought in its most traditional incarnations
emphasized the universal Fatherhood of God, the brotherhood of man,
the infinite value of the human soul, the example of Jesus, and the
establishment of the moral-ethical
[Kingdom of God](Kingdom_of_God "Kingdom of God") on Earth. It has
often been relativistic, pluralistic, and non-doctrinal.

Liberalism birthed other movements with varying emphases. Among
these movements have been the
[Social Gospel](Social_Gospel "Social Gospel"), theological
[Feminism](Feminism "Feminism"),
[Liberation theology](Liberation_theology "Liberation theology"),
[Process theology](Process_theology "Process theology"), and the
[Jesus Seminar](Jesus_Seminar "Jesus Seminar"). One product of
these movements is the heretical
[Myth of Christian Origins](Liberal_Myth_of_Christian_Origins "Liberal Myth of Christian Origins")
which denies the divinity of Christ and the authority of
scripture.

## Reactions to theological liberalism

Various movements in Christianity resulted as reactions to liberal
influence. Most of these groups attempted to reclaim and affirm
what they viewed as traditional Christian orthodoxy. Reactions
against liberalism have included:

-   [Evangelicalism](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism"), a
    conservative renewal movement of the 18th and 19th centuries,
    re-affirmed in the mid 20th century as separate from today's more
    narrowly defined "fundamentalism."
-   [Fundamentalism](Fundamentalism "Fundamentalism"), an early
    20th century movement within Evangelicalism in reaction to
    Liberalism and [Modernism](Modernism "Modernism"), has become more
    narrowly associated with
    [dispensational](Dispensationalism "Dispensationalism") theology
    and social separatism.
-   [Neo-Orthodoxy](Neo-Orthodoxy "Neo-Orthodoxy"), an early-to-mid
    20th century movement led primarily by
    [Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth") and
    [Emil Brunner](Emil_Brunner "Emil Brunner") which made use of
    existentialism and emphasized the transcendence of God and the
    sinfulness of humankind.
-   [Pentecostalism](Pentecostalism "Pentecostalism"), an early
    20th century movement which reacted against what some perceived as
    the stale worship and devotional life among churches dominated by
    liberalism.
-   [Neo-Wesleyanism](Albert_C._Outler "Albert C. Outler"), a
    mid-late 20th century movement in
    [Methodism](Methodism "Methodism") dominated by
    [Albert C. Outler](Albert_C._Outler "Albert C. Outler") which
    developed authoritative editions of the works of
    [John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley") in an attempt to reclaim
    pure Wesleyan thought.
-   [Post-Liberalism](Narrative_theology "Narrative theology"),
    also called *narrative theology*, a late 20th century movement led
    initially by George Lindbeck which emphasizes the authority of the
    Biblical narrative as opposed to its historical veracity or
    [inerrancy](Inerrancy "Inerrancy").

Other important liberal theologians include:

-   George W. F. Hegel
-   [Albrecht Ritschl](Albrecht_Ritschl "Albrecht Ritschl")
-   [Adolph von Harnack](index.php?title=Adolph_von_Harnack&action=edit&redlink=1 "Adolph von Harnack (page does not exist)")
-   Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor of Riverside Church in New York
    City, perhaps liberalism's best known preacher
-   [Paul Tillich](Paul_Tillich "Paul Tillich") (referred to by
    Stanley Hauerwas and
    [William Willimon](William_Willimon "William Willimon") in their
    1989 book *Resident Aliens* as the last great 19th century
    theologian due to his substantial influence, not necessarily for
    his theology)

Liberalism has proven to be extremely controversial in the Church.
While it had come to dominate the American religious landscape by
the mid-20th century, by the end of the century it was dying as it
suffered defeats in mainline churches and as American Christianity
began placing a renewed emphasis on doctrinal orthodoxy.

## Quotes

-   "No, I'm delighted that liberal theologians do their best to do
    what Pio Nono said shouldn't be done -- try to accommodate
    Christianity to modern science, modern culture, and democratic
    society. If I were a fundamentalist Christian, I'd be appalled by
    the wishy-washiness of their version of the Christian faith. But
    since I am a non-believer who is frightened of the barbarity of
    many fundamentalist Christians (e.g., their homophobia), I welcome
    theological liberalism. Maybe liberal theologians will eventually
    produce a version of Christianity so wishy-washy that nobody will
    be interested in being a Christian any more. If so, something will
    have been lost, but probably more will have been gained." - Richard
    Rorty, a [postmodern](Postmodern "Postmodern") philosopher
