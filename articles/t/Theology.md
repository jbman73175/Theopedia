**Theology** (from the [Greek](Greek "Greek") *theos* - God - and
*logos* - word or reason) is reasoned discourse concerning
[God](God "God"). More specifically, Christian theology is the
rational study and understanding of the [nature](Nature "Nature")
of [God](God "God") and [doctrines](Doctrine "Doctrine") of the
Christian faith based on the God's
[revelation](Revelation "Revelation") of Himself, chiefly found in
the [Bible](Bible "Bible").

A person who pursues the study of theology is called a
[theologian](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theologians "Category:Theologians").

## Lewis on theology

"Everyone reads, everyone hears things discussed. Consequently, if
you do not listen to Theology, that will not mean that you have no
ideas about God. It will mean that you have a lot of wrong ones —
bad, muddled, out-of-date ideas." -
[C. S. Lewis](C._S._Lewis "C. S. Lewis"), *Mere Christianity*
