## The triune God

"The doctrine of the Trinity is what basically distinguishes the
Christian doctrine of God as Christian, and therefore what already
distinguishes the Christian concept of revelation as Christian, in
contrast to all other possible doctrines of God or concepts of
revelation." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

"It can fairly be said that the chief ecumenical enterprise of
current theology is rediscovery and development of the doctrine of
the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"). It can also fairly be said that
Barth initiated the enterprise" ^[[2]](#note-1)^
[Robert Jenson's](Robert_Jenson "Robert Jenson") quote must be seen
in the context of
[Friedrich Schleiermacher](Friedrich_Schleiermacher "Friedrich Schleiermacher"),
who placed the Trinity at the end of his systematic work,
*The Christian Faith* (1821, rev. 1830). Barth purposefully placed
the Trinity at the beginning of his *Church Dogmatics*, signifying
its importance and centrality to the exposition and proclamation of
theology. Since Barth, Protestant theologians have found a renewed
interest in the Trinity, and contemporary theology has seen it
return to the forefront of dogmatics and theological method.

## Threefold Word of God

Barth held to what is known as the threefold Word of God. In other
words, preaching (or proclamation), scripture, and revelation are
considered to be three different, yet unified forms of the Word of
God. Barth's analogy was the Trinity (see *CD* I/1, 121).
Futhermore,

There is no distinction of degree or value between these three
forms. For to the extent that proclamation really rests on
recollection of the revelation attested in the Bible and is thus
obedient repitition of the biblical witness, it is no less the Word
of God than the Bible. And to the extent that the Bible really
attests revelation it is no less the Word of God than revelation
itself. As the Bible and proclamation become God's Word in virtue
of the actuality of revelation, they are God's Word: the one Word
of God within which there can be neither a more nor a less. Nor
should we ever try to understand the three forms of God's Word in
isolation. The first, revelation, is the form that underlies the
other two (*CD* I/1, 120-121).
[Bruce McCormack](Bruce_McCormack "Bruce McCormack") notes that
what Barth is after is a "*unity*-in-differentiation."
^[[3]](#note-2)^ Each form is distinct from one another (as the
persons of the Trinity are), yet are unified with each other (cf.
*CD* I/2, 463).

### Preaching

"Real proclamation, then, means the Word of God preached and the
Word of God preached means... man's talk about God on the basis of
God's own direction, which fundamentally transcends all human
causation, which cannot, then, be put on a human basis, but which
simply takes place, and has to be acknowledged, as a fact" (*CD*
I/1, 90). Barth's point is that preaching may become the Word of
God not because of something we do, but according to God's
direction. Thus, God's Word is free and not something controlled or
possessed by the church.

## Election

One of the most influential and controversial features of Barth's
*Church Dogmatics* was his doctrine of election (see *CD* II/2).
One thread of the Reformed tradition, following the interpretation
of its most influential thinker,
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin"), argued for the so-called
double predestination: [God](God "God") chose some humans for
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation") through Christ and others for
damnation. These groups were sometimes called the "elect" and
"reprobate." This choice (or election) was made by God and was the
result of His "absolute decree," a mysterious and fundamentally
inscrutable decision which, though it was a decision of ultimate
consequence for the individual human, was fundamentally
inaccessible and unknowable to him or her. God chose each person to
be saved or damned based on the divine will, and it was impossible
to know why God chose some and not others or whether God had
elected or rejected oneself.

Barth's doctrine of election involves a firm rejection of the
notion of an absolute decree. In keeping with his Christo-centric
methodology, Barth argues that to ascribe the salvation or
damnation of humanity to an abstract and absolute decree is to make
some part of God more final and definitive than God's saving act in
Jesus Christ. God's absolute decree, if one may speak of such a
thing, is God's gracious decision to be "for" humanity in the
person of Jesus Christ (Barth calls this God's "Yes"). With the
earlier Reformed tradition, Barth retains the notion of double
predestination, but he makes Jesus simultaneously the object and
subject of both divine election and reprobation: Jesus embodies
God's election of humanity and God's rejection of human sin. He is
the electing God and the elect man. As the electing God, Jesus
elects all of humanity in himself. And thus, as the elected man,
all who are "in Christ" are elect in him. Non-believers, it is
said, have simply not realized or recognized their election in
Christ.

While some regard this revision of the doctrine of election as an
improvement on the Calvinist doctrine of double
predestination,^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^
critics have charged that Barth's view amounts to an implicit
universalism.^[***[citation\ needed](http://www.theopedia.com/Theopedia:Writing_guide#Reference_your_work\ "Theopedia:Writing\ guide")***]^

## Universalism?

Barth has also been criticized for his alleged belief in
[universalism](Universalism "Universalism"), however, Barth himself
noted that insistence on necessary universal salvation impinged on
God's freedom and suggested it was beyond the church's duty to
speculate on the subject (*Church Dogmatics* 2.2, 417). "For Barth,
the grace of God is characterised by freedom. On the one hand, this
means that we can never impose limits on the scope of grace; and on
the other hand, it means that we can never impose a universalist
'system' on grace. In either case, we would be compromising the
freedom of grace - we would be presuming that we can define the
exact scope of God's liberality. So Barth's theology of grace
includes a dialectical protest: Barth protests both against a
system of universalism and against a denial of universalism! The
crucial point is that God's grace is free grace: it is nothing
other than God himself acting in freedom. And if God acts in
freedom, then we can neither deny nor affirm the possibility of
universal salvation." ^[[4]](#note-3)^

Barth says that,

"The proclamation of the Church must make allowance for this
freedom of grace. *Apokatastasis Panton*? No, for a grace which
automatically would ultimately have to embrace each and every one
would certainly not be free grace. It surely would not be God's
grace. But would it be God's free grace if we could absolutely deny
that it could do that? Has Christ been sacrificed only for our
sins? Has he not ... been sacrificed for the whole world? ...
[Thus] the freedom of grace is preserved on both these sides."
^[[5]](#note-4)^
For Barth, then, we can neither affirm nor deny the possibility
that all will be saved. So what can we do? Barth's answer is clear:
we can *hope* (see *CD* IV/3, pp. 477-78). ^[[6]](#note-5)^

## Apologetics

Barth's theology denies the necessity of
[apologetics](Apologetics "Apologetics"). He states in
*The Epistle to the Romans*:

The Gospel is not a truth among other truths. Rather, it sets a
question-mark against all truths. The Gospel is not the door but
the hinge. The man who apprehends its meaning is removed from all
strife, because he is engaged in a strife with the whole, even with
existence itself. Anxiety concerning the victory of the
Gospel--that is, Christian Apologetics--is meaningless, because the
Gospel is the victory by which the world is overcome. ... It [the
Gospel] does not require representatives with a sense of
responsibility, for it is as responsible for those who proclaim it
as it is for those to whom it is proclaimed. It is the advocate of
both. ... God does not need us. Indeed, if He were not God, He
would be ashamed of us. We, at any rate, cannot be ashamed of Him.
