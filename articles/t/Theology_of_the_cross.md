The **theology of the cross** is the name given by
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") to a theological
approach which looks to the cross as the centre, source and sum of
Christian theology. He contrasted it with the various
[theologies of glory](index.php?title=Theology_of_glory&action=edit&redlink=1 "Theology of glory (page does not exist)"),
which are founded upon the idea that humans can, by using what is
within them, reach God's righteousness or revelation. Both these
concepts were introduced in Luther's
[Heidelberg Disputation](index.php?title=Heidelberg_Disputation&action=edit&redlink=1 "Heidelberg Disputation (page does not exist)")
of 1518, where he described the difference between the two
theologies.

"What is, after all, the subject matter of a theology of the cross?
Is it simply a repetition of the Passion story? Hardly. Is it then
perhaps just another treatment of the doctrine of atonement? Not
really. Is it just an account of an unusual sort of religious
experience, a kind of spirituality, as we might say today? That may
be closer to the truth, but still not exactly. It is rather a
particular perception of the world and our destiny, what Luther
came to call looking at all things through suffering and the
cross."^[[1]](#note-0)^
