**Theosis** is the understanding that human beings can have real
union with God, and so become like God to such a degree that we
participate in the divine nature. Primarily a term found in
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy") and
[Oriental Orthodox](Oriental_Orthodox "Oriental Orthodox")
theology, from the Greek meaning *deification* or *making divine*,
theosis is a concept derived from the New Testament regarding the
goal of our relationship with the Triune God. The terms *theosis*
and *deification* may therefore be used interchangeably in this
context.

This does not imply that we become gods, but rather, that we are to
become the fullness of the "divine image" in which we were created
(Gen. 1:26), i.e. a perfect reflection of our God, and become
partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). It may be related to
the Protestant concept of
[sanctification](Sanctification "Sanctification") but goes further
with what may be expected in this life, emphasizing the element of
our mystical union with God in Christ. It may also be seen as
something akin to the Wesleyan idea of "entire sanctification".
However, Theosis remains a mystical concept not easily grasped and
subject to various interpretations.
