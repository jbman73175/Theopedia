**Theotokos** (Greek: *God-Bearer*), in
[Eastern Orthodoxy](Eastern_Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy"), the
designation of the Virgin Mary as *mother of God*. The term has had
great historical importance because the
[Nestorians](Nestorianism "Nestorianism"), who stressed the
independence of the divine and human natures in Christ, opposed its
use, on the ground that it compromised the human nature of Christ,
and held that the more accurate and proper term for Mary was
Christotokos (“Christ-Bearer”). The
[Council of Ephesus](Council_of_Ephesus "Council of Ephesus")
(431), basing its arguments on the unity of the person of Christ,
anathematized all who denied that Christ was truly divine, and
asserted that Mary was truly the mother of God. The
[Council of Chalcedon](Council_of_Chalcedon "Council of Chalcedon")
(451) used the term in formulating the definition of the
[hypostatic union](Hypostatic_union "Hypostatic union") (of
Christ’s human and divine natures).^[[1]](#note-0)^
