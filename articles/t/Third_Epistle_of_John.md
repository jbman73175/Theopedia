## Author and Date

The third epistle of John was written by the
[apostle](Apostle "Apostle") [John](John "John") about the year 90
A.D. from the city of
[Ephesus](index.php?title=Ephesus&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ephesus (page does not exist)")
in Asia Minor.

## Blueprint

The third epistle of John is the second-shortest book in the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"), consisting of only fifteen verses. Despite
its brevity, 3 John is generally divided into two sections:

-   God's children live by the standards of the
    [gospel](Gospel "Gospel") (1-12)
-   Conclusion (13-15)

John wrote to commend
[Gaius](index.php?title=Gaius&action=edit&redlink=1 "Gaius (page does not exist)"),
who was taking care of traveling teachers and
[missionaries](index.php?title=Missionaries&action=edit&redlink=1 "Missionaries (page does not exist)"),
and also to warn against people like
[Diotrephes](index.php?title=Diotrephes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Diotrephes (page does not exist)"),
who was proud and refused to listen to spiritual leaders in
authority. If we are to live in the truth of the gospel, we must
look for ways to support [pastors](Pastors "Pastors"), Christian
workers, and missionaries today. All Christians should work
together to support God's work, both at home and around the world.

## Themes

Major themes contained in third John include:

-   **hospitality** - John wrote to encourage those who were kind
    to others. Genuine hospitality for traveling Christian workers was
    needed then and is still important today. This is imporant as
    faithful Christian teachers and missionaries need our support.
    Whenever you can extend hospitality to others, it will make you a
    partner in their
    [ministry](index.php?title=Ministry&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ministry (page does not exist)").

-   **pride** - Diotrephes not only refused to offer hospitality,
    but he set himself up as a church boss. Pride disqualified him from
    being a real leader. This is important because Christian leaders
    must shun pride and its effects on them. Be careful not to misuse
    your position of leadership.

-   **faithfulness** - Gaius and Demetrius were commended for their
    faithful work in the church. They were held up as examples of
    faithful, sefless servants. We shouldn't take for granted Christian
    workers who serve faithfully. Be sure to encourage them so they
    won't grow weary of serving.
