The **Third Wave** is a term apparently coined by Christian
theologian C Peter Wagner around 1980 to describe the recent
historical working of the [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit")
in the church. It is part of a larger movement called the
"Neocharismatic" movement. The Third Wave involves those Christians
who have received [Pentecostal](Pentecostal "Pentecostal")-like
experiences; however, those who identify with this movement claim
no association with either the Pentecostal or
[Charismatic](Charismatic "Charismatic") movements. According to
Wagner:

-   The First "wave" occurred at the beginning of the twentieth
    century with the rise of the Pentecostal movement, beginning with
    the Azusa Street Revival.
-   The Second "wave" occurred during the 1960s as the Charismatic
    movement spread throughout mainline protestant denominations, as
    well as the Roman Catholic Church. The
    [Word of Faith](Word_of_Faith "Word of Faith") movement is also an
    expression of this wave.
-   The Third "wave" occurred during the mid 1980s and continues
    today, and is associated with Wagner's own ministry, as well as the
    [Vineyard Movement](Vineyard_Movement "Vineyard Movement"), and
    others.
