**Thomas Boston** (1676-1732), was a Scottish church leader born at
Duns. He was educated at Edinburgh, and licensed in 1697 by the
[presbytery](index.php?title=Presbytery&action=edit&redlink=1 "Presbytery (page does not exist)")
of Chirnside. In 1699 he became minister of the small parish of
Simprin, where there were only 90 examinable persons. In 1704 he
found, while visiting a member of his flock, a book brought into
Scotland by a commonwealth soldier. This was the famous
*Marrow of Modern Divinity*, by Edward Fisher, a compendium of the
opinions of leading [Reformation](Reformation "Reformation")
divines on the doctrine of grace and the offer of the
[Gospel](Gospel "Gospel"), which set off the
[Marrow Controversy](Marrow_Controversy "Marrow Controversy").

Its object was to demonstrate the unconditional freeness of the
Gospel. It cleared away such conditions as repentance, or some
degree of outward or inward reformation, and argued that where
[Christ](Jesus "Jesus") is heartily received, full repentance and a
new life follow. On Boston's recommendation, James Hog of Carnock
reprinted *The Marrow* in 1718; and Boston also published an
edition with notes of his own. The book, being attacked from the
standpoint of high [Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"), became the
standard of a far-reaching movement in Scottish
[Presbyterianism](Presbyterian "Presbyterian").

The *Marrow* men were marked by the zeal of their service and the
effect of their preaching. As they remained Calvinists they could
not preach a universal atonement; they were in fact extreme
[particular redemptionists](Limited_atonement "Limited atonement").
In 1707 Boston was translated to Ettrick, Scotland. He
distinguished himself by being the only member of the assembly who
entered a protest against what he deemed the inadequate sentence
passed on John Simson, professor of divinity at Glasgow, who was
accused of heterodox teaching on the
[Incarnation](Incarnation "Incarnation").

Boston, if unduly introspective, was a man of singular piety and
amiability. His autobiography is an interesting record of Scottish
life, full of sincerity and tenderness, and not devoid of humorous
touches, intentional and otherwise.

His books, *The Fourfold State*, *The Crook in the Lot*, and his
*Body of Divinity* and *Miscellanies*, had a powerful influence
over the Scottish peasantry. His *Memoirs* were published in 1776
(ed. GD Low, 1908). An edition of his works in 12 volumes appeared
in 1849.
