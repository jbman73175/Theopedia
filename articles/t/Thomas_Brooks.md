**Thomas Brooks** (1608-1680). "Nonconformist preacher. Born into a
Puritan family, he was sent to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He soon
became an advocate of the Congregational way and served as a
chaplain in the Civil War. In 1648 he accepted the rectory of St.
Margaret's, New Fish Street, London, but only after making his
Congregational principles clear to the vestry. On several occasions
he preached before Parliament. He was ejected in 1660 and remained
in London as a Nonconformist preacher. Government spies reported
that he preached at Tower Wharf and in Moorfields. During the Great
Plague and Great Fire he worked in London, and in 1672 was granted
a license to preach in Lime Street. He wrote over a dozen books,
most of which are devotional in character. He was buried in Bunhill
Fields." (Peter Toon,
*New International Dictionary of the Christian Church*)
