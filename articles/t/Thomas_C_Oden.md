Thomas C. Oden
**Thomas Clark Oden** (b. October 21, 1931) is an American
[Methodist](Methodism "Methodism") theologian associated with Drew
University in New Jersey and the Director of the
[Center for Early African Christianity](http://earlyafricanchristianity.com/index.html).
An ordained United Methodist [Elder](Elder "Elder") (pastor), he is
perhaps most recently known for his call for a return to "classical
Christianity" as exemplified in his *After Modernity...What?*
(1992) and
*The Rebirth of Orthodoxy: Signs of New Life in Christianity*
(2002). Some see his efforts as resulting in a "Paleo-Orthodox
movement" extending beyond Methodism. He has been important in the
contemporary ecumenical movement and in
[evangelical](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") circles. His
influences include United Methodist theologian
[Albert C. Outler](Albert_C._Outler "Albert C. Outler").

Oden adopted the term *paleo-orthodoxy* for his approach to
theology. The term is derived from the roots "paleo" (meaning
"ancient") and "orthodox" (meaning "correct belief"), so it
essentially means "ancient correct belief". He has written, "The
term paleo-orthodoxy is employed to make clear that we are not
talking about *[neo-orthodoxy](Neo-Orthodoxy "Neo-Orthodoxy")*.
*Paleo-* becomes a necessary prefix only because the term
*orthodoxy* has been preempted and to some degree tarnished by the
modern tradition of neo-orthodoxy" (*Requiem*, p. 130). Odens' name
was further linked to the term "paleo-orthodoxy" and to the idea of
the movement by the publication of
*Ancient & Postmodern Christianity: Paleo-Orthodoxy in the 21st Century: Essays In Honor of Thomas C. Oden*
(2002).

Oden believes that Christians need to rely upon the wisdom of the
historic Church, particularly the early Church, rather than on
modern scholarship and theology, which is often, in his view,
tainted by political agendas. This is commendable though somewhat
naive since political agendas can be found in the early church as
well.

Oden's desire is, "...to begin to prepare the
[postmodern](Postmodernism "Postmodernism") Christian community for
its third millennium by returning again to the careful study and
respectful following of the central tradition of classical
Christianity" (*After Modernity...What?*, p. 34). Oden himself has
written that he hopes, "...to make no new contribution to theology"
(*Life in the Spirit*, p. vii), preferring instead to recapture the
spirit and authority of the patristic writers. Oden's work has been
influential within the United Methodist Church and also positively
received in the broader evangelical community.
