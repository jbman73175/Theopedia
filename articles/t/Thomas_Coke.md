[Bishop](Bishop "Bishop") **Thomas Coke** (1747-1814) was the first
American [Methodist](Methodism "Methodism") bishop. He was born in
the Welsh town of Brecon, the son of a wealthy apothecary. He was
educated at Jesus College, Oxford, and took Anglican orders in
1772. Coke was driven from his curacy in 1776 because of his
evangelical leanings and he then joined with the
[Methodists](Methodism "Methodism"). He swiftly rose to become
[John Wesley's](John_Wesley "John Wesley") chief assistant and it
was widely assumed that Wesley intended Coke to be his successor.

In 1784 Wesley appointed him to be "Superintendent" of American
Methodism and during his first trip to the United States later that
year Coke ordained
[Francis Asbury](Francis_Asbury "Francis Asbury") to be his
colleague. The two became the first two American Methodist bishops.
A modern day printing company for the United Methodist, Episcopal,
Presbyterian Churches as well as Disciples of Christ was created
combining the surnames of Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke to make
Cokesbury (the official printing company for the listed
denominations).

Coke was to make repeated visits to the United States during the
next twenty-five years. He travelled extensively on preaching tours
and, while he was never fully accepted because of what Americans
viewed as his divided loyalties, he nevertheless played a
significant part in shaping the American Church.

Coke served two terms as President of the Wesleyan Conference in
Britain and also presided regularly over the Irish Conference.
Arguably most significant contribution was however in the field of
overseas missions. He was seen as a conservative; he is criticised
by the historian E. P. Thompson for his surrender under any
government pressure. According to D. M. Valenze, Coke lived through
particularly trying times for the Methodist movement. Lowther
highlighted this when explaining the genesis of the Primitive
Methodist movement. The pressures of the French Revolutionary wars
were causes of a conservative shift in Methodist strategy.

In addition to his work abroad in the United States, he made four
tours of the West Indies and promoted missionary ventures in
Canada, West Africa and Gibraltar. He was also an author; writing
on such subjects as a multi-volume commentary on the Bible and a
history of the West Indies. Coke died while en route to India as
the leader of the first Methodist mission to that country. He is
known as the "Father of Methodist Missions".
