**Thomas Cranmer** (July 2, 1489 - March 21, 1556) was the
Archbishop of Canterbury during the reigns of the English kings
Henry VIII and Edward VI.

## Biographical sketch

Born in 1489 at Nottingham, Cranmer was educated at Jesus College,
Cambridge and became a priest following the death of his first
wife. By the time of the controversy over the divorce of King Henry
from his wife, Catherine of Aragon, Cranmer had risen to an
influential position, and his willingness to pursue the matter on
the King's behalf won him further advancement, despite the fact
that he had secretly married the niece of Andreas Osiander, a
Lutheran theologian, in Nuremberg. On March 30, 1533, he became
Archbishop of Canterbury, and was able to push through the reforms
that led gradually to the reform of the Church of England. In 1538
he condemned the views of John Lambert when he denied the real
presence of Jesus Christ in the bread and wine of the
[eucharist](Eucharist "Eucharist"). Lambert was burnt at the stake,
but Cranmer later came to adopt his views. Cranmer also opposed
Henry VIII's 6 Articles, which reaffirmed clerical celibacy and
[transubstantiation](Transubstantiation "Transubstantiation").

On Henry's death in 1547, Cranmer became an indispensable advisor
to his son and successor, Edward, who, though still a child, had
been brought up with Protestant views. Cranmer promoted the
Reformation theologically, supporting the English Bible translation
of 1537-40. During Edward's reign, Cranmer introduced the
[Book of Common Prayer](Book_of_Common_Prayer "Book of Common Prayer")
(1549), a modernized version of which is still used today, and in
general, led the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England") in a
more [Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") direction. He also
produced the confession of 1553 called the Forty-two Articles (the
basis of the
[Thirty-nine Articles](Thirty-nine_Articles "Thirty-nine Articles")),
which taught justification by faith.

Edward died in 1553, to be succeeded by his half-sister, Mary I of
England, who had been brought up a
[Catholic](Catholicism "Catholicism") and wished to return the
country to its former faith. Added to that she had personal reason
to dislike Cranmer as, by annulling her parents marriage, he lead
to her being declared illegitimate. Under pressure, he had also
signed in favor of proclaiming Lady Jane Grey Queen. Convicted of
treason and [heresy](Heresy "Heresy") he was condemned to die. In
an effort to save his life he signed seven submissive recantations.
However, he publicly repudiated his recantations just before he was
burnt at the stake on 21st March, 1556. At the point of execution,
he thrust his right hand into the fire, this being the hand which
had signed the document. He was executed in Oxford where two other
bishops, Ridley and Latimer, had been burned in 1555. The event is
commemorated by the so-called Martyrs' Memorial, a Victorian
construction not far from the original site, which is marked by a
cross on the road.
