**Thomas Goodwin** (1600-1680) "Congregational divine. Born in
Norfolk and educated at Cambridge, he became a fellow of St.
Catherine's and vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge. On
becoming a Congregationalist in 1634 he resigned and moved to
London. In 1639 persecution drove him to Holland, where he was a
pastor of a church at Arnheim, He returned to London when the Long
Parliament began to sit and formed a gathered church in London.
Nominated as a member of the Westminster Assembly, he became the
leader of the Dissenting Brethren in it. In 1649 he was appointed a
chaplain to the Council of State, and in 1650 president of Magdalen
College, Oxford. Goodwin was a leading member of both the Board of
Visitors in the university and the Cromwellian Triers. From 1656 he
enjoyed the confidence of Oliver Cromwell. He was a prominent
member of the Savoy Assembly of Congregational elders in 1658 and
was much esteemed among the gathered churches of the nation. After
the Restoration he moved from Oxford to London and was pastor of a
gathered church in the City. His works were published in five folio
volumes between 1682 and 1704 and have often been reprinted. They
include devotional, expository, doctrinal, and ecclesiastical
studies and are Calvinistic in outlook." (Peter Toon,
*New International Dictionary of the Christian Church*).
