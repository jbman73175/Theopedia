**Thomas Manton** (1620-1677) was born in Lawrence-Lydiat,
Somerset, England to a religious family, where his father and both
grandfathers were both ministers. When he was 15 he entered the
Wadham College at the University of Oxford. At nineteen he was
ordained by Bishop Joseph Hall of Exeter (later of Norwich).

He was called to the parish of Stoke Newington in Middlesex in the
winter of 1644-1645, and began to build a reputation as a
forthright and popular defender of
[Reformed](Reformation "Reformation") principles. This led to his
participation in several key events, such as the Westminster
Assembly and confession publication, and his being asked to preach
before Parliament on several occasions. While at Middlesex, he
delivered and wrote his exposition on the Epistles of
[James](Epistle_of_James "Epistle of James") and Jude, which are
still being printed today. He was instrumental in the restoration
of Charles II and became a Royal Chaplain, but in the Great
Ejection he suffered along with other
[Puritans](Puritan "Puritan"). He died October 18th, 1677 and his
body was interred in the church at Stoke Newington.
