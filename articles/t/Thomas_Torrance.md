Thomas F. Torrance
**Thomas F. Torrance** (1913 - Dec 2, 2007) was a 20th century
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant")
[Christian](Christian "Christian")
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian") who served for 27 years as
Professor of Christian Dogmatics at New College, Edinburgh in the
University of Edinburgh. Besides writing many books and articles,
Torrance also translated several hundred theological writings into
English from other languages, including the thirteen-volume,
six-million-word *Church Dogmatics* of the Swiss theologian
[Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth") (co-edited with G.W.
Bromiley). Torrance is considered by some to be one of the most
important Reformed theologians of his era.

Born in 1913 to missionary parents in China, Torrance studied
Classics as an undergraduate at the University of Edinburgh. He
completed his doctorate in 1946 under the supervision of
[Karl Barth](Karl_Barth "Karl Barth") at the University of Basel.
