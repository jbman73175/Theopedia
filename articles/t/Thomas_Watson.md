Thomas Watson
**Thomas Watson** (ca. 1620-1686), an English
[Nonconformist](Nonconformist "Nonconformist") Puritan preacher and
author. Watson was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where
he was noted for remarkably intense study. In 1646 he commenced a
sixteen year pastorate at St. Stephen's, Walbrook. He showed strong
Presbyterian views during the civil war, with, however, an
attachment to the king, and in 1651 he was imprisoned briefly with
some other ministers for his share in Christopher Love's plot to
recall Charles II of England. He was released on June 30, 1652, and
was formally reinstated as vicar of St. Stephen's Walbrook. Watson
obtained great fame and popularity as a preacher until the
Restoration, when he was ejected for nonconformity. Notwithstanding
the rigor of the acts against dissenters, Watson continued to
exercise his ministry privately as he found opportunity. Upon the
Declaration of Indulgence in 1672 he obtained a license to preach
at the great hall in Crosby House. After preaching there for
several years, his health gave way, and he retired to Barnston,
Essex, where he died suddenly while praying in secret. He was
buried on 28 July 1686.
