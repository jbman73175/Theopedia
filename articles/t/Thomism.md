**Thomism** is a philosophical school of thought following the
teachings of [Thomas Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas"),
especially as contained in his most famous summary work,
*Summa Theologica*, the importance of which the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") church arguably
regards as second only to the Bible.

## Thomas Aquinas' philosophy

### Generally

Aquinas worked to create a philosophical system which integrated
[Christian](Christian "Christian") doctrine with elements taken
from the philosophy of Aristotle. Generally, he augmented the
Neo-Platonic view of philosophy which, after
[Augustine](Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo"), had become
tremendously influential amongst medieval philosophers, with
insights drawn from Aristotle. In this he was greatly influenced by
his reading of contemporary Arabic philosophers, especially
Averroes. Aquinas, is, therefore, generally agreed to have moved
the focus of Scholastic philosophy from Plato to Aristotle. The
extent to which he was successful in doing this is, of course,
still hotly debated.

### Distinctive ideas

-   Philosophical realism: Aquinas believed that humans were
    composed of two parts: "prime matter" and "substantial form." The
    prime matter of humans is our body, and the substantial form is our
    soul. The soul is therefore not made of matter. Our souls are
    unique; there can be no two angels or humans that bear the same
    substantial form, or soul.
-   Moral objectivism: The nature of the universe and essences of
    objects do not depend on the free will of God, but on His
    intellect, and ultimately on His essence, which is unchanging. The
    natural law, springing from the mind of God, is therefore
    immutable. Consequently, immoral acts are immoral not simply
    because God forbids them, but because they are inherently immoral.
    (Zigliara, "Sum. phil." (3 vols., Paris, 1889), ccx, xi, II, M. 23,
    24, 25)
-   Teleology: the universe is guided by principles, purpose, and
    design beyond the universe itself; specifically, the principles and
    design of [God](God "God").
-   [Free will](Free_will "Free will"): Decisions are made by the
    interaction of the will and the intellect; the will presents
    objects to the intellect, and the intellect directs the will. Acts
    begin with the apprehension of the good in general by the
    intellect. We desire happiness naturally and necessarily, and not
    by free will; however, we choose particular goods freely. The will
    is a blind faculty, always following the past determination of the
    intellect. (Zigliara, 51).
-   Senses: The senses are passive, in that they perceive, rather
    than creating, their objects. However, the will controls the
    exercise of the faculties, and thus determines and shapes what they
    perceive and how they perceive it.
-   Empiricism: Held to the
    [Peripatetic axiom](index.php?title=Peripatetic_axiom&action=edit&redlink=1 "Peripatetic axiom (page does not exist)"):
    "Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses,"
    modified by saying that the intellect can ascend to the knowledge
    of higher things from the basis of perception, even God, and that
    the soul knows of its existence by its action.
-   First principles: the basis for human knowledge is latent in
    the soul, not in the form of objective knowledge, but in the form
    of subjective inclination to believe them due to the evidentiary
    support: As soon as they are proposed they are known to be true.
    (Zigliara, op. cit., pp. 32-42).
-   Universals: Universals are the primary object of the intellect,
    and are formed by abstraction from sense perception. The process of
    abstraction is so elevated above material conditions as to prove
    that man is spiritual.
-   [Immortality](index.php?title=Immortality&action=edit&redlink=1 "Immortality (page does not exist)"):
    The human soul is immortal by its very nature, because it has no
    principle of disintegration (Zigliara, p. 9).
-   Arguments for the existence of God are made a posteriori,
    rather than a priori. In other words, the existence of God can be
    proven through perceptions and reason, but cannot be known by any
    innate knowledge. Thus the
    [ontological](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God#Ontological_argument "Arguments for the existence of God")
    argument is rejected, but several other arguments are made for the
    existence of God; these are considered in the next section.

## The five ways

Aquinas shows "five ways" to indicate the existence of God, some of
which are developed in detail in his *Summa Contra Gentiles*.

### The first way

(Prime Mover) "It is clear that there are in this world things
which are moved. Now, every object which is moved receives that
movement from another. If the motor is itself moved, there must be
another motor moving it, and after that yet another, and so on. But
it is impossible to go on indefinitely, for then there would be no
first motor at all, and consequently no movement" ("Contra
Gentiles," ii. 33). This proof, like much of
[Thomas Aquinas](Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas")'s thought, is
taken from Aristotle, whose "unmoved mover" forms the first
recorded example of the cosmological argument for God's existence.

### The second way

"We discern in all sensible things a certain chain of efficient
causes. We find, however, nothing which is its own efficient cause,
for that cause would then be anterior to itself. On the other side,
it is impossible to ascend from cause to cause indefinitely in the
series of efficient causes....There must therefore exist one
self-sufficient, efficient cause, and that is God" ("Contra Gent."
i. 22).

### The third way

"We find in nature things which may be and may not be, since there
are some who are born and others who die; they consequently can
exist or not exist. But it is impossible that such things should
live for ever, for there is nothing which may be as well as not be
at one time. Thus if all beings need not have existed, there must
have been a time in which nothing existed. But, in that case,
nothing would exist now; for that which does not exist can not
receive life but from one who exists; . . . there must therefore be
in nature a necessarily existent being."

### The fourth way

Any category has its degrees, such as good and better, warm and
warmer. Each also has one thing that's the ultimate of that
measure, like good and "best", warm and "hottest". And whatever is
the most of that category is the source of that category, as fire
(or, in modern terms, energy itself) is the source of heat, and God
must therefore be the source of goodness.

### The fifth way

Everything, sentient or otherwise, progresses in an orderly way.
Planets move in their orbits, light breaks from and combines into
its spectrum, et cetera. Reality has a natural order, which could
not have come from nothing, yet which precedes mere humans.

Some believe that the Fifth Way is equivalent to what is now called
[Intelligent Design](index.php?title=Intelligent_Design&action=edit&redlink=1 "Intelligent Design (page does not exist)").
However, this is not an accurate presentation of Aquinas' thought,
and is subject to the Cosmogonical Fallacy.

## Demonstrating God's creative power

In order to demonstrate God's creative power, Thomas says: "If a
being participates, to a certain degree, in an 'accident,' this
accidental property must have been communicated to it by a cause
which possesses it essentially. Thus iron becomes incandescent by
the action of fire. Now, God is His own power which subsists by
itself. The being which subsists by itself is necessarily one"
("Summa Theol." i. 44, art. 1). This idea is also expounded by
Bahya ibn Pakuda in his "Duties of the Heart."

## Impact of Thomism

Saint Thomas was important in shifting the influence of medieval
philosophy (also known as Scholasticism) away from Plato and
towards Aristotle. In this he was influenced by contemporary Arabic
philosophy, especially the work of Averroes. The ensuing school of
thought, through its influence on Catholicism and the ethics of the
Catholic school, is by any standard one of the most influential
philosophies of all time, also significant due to the sheer number
of people living by its teachings. Thomism also influenced the
birth of [Protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism"), which
arose partially as a reaction to the authoritarian, Thomic dogma of
the Catholic Church.

Thomism prevailed and became the official dogma of the Catholic
Church, offering a coherent, logical, and clear metaphysical
picture of both the material and spiritual worlds. It prevailed as
a coherent system until the discovery of Newtonian mechanics, which
contradicted the Aristotelian physics, thereby discrediting
supplanting much of the thomistic [ontology](Ontology "Ontology").
However, the ethical parts of Thomism, as well as a large part of
its views on life, humans, and theology, transcended into the
various schools of Neothomism that are the official dogma of the
[Roman Catholic Church](Roman_Catholic_Church "Roman Catholic Church")
today.

## Opponents

Both
[Scotists](index.php?title=Scotism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Scotism (page does not exist)")
and [Molinists](Molinism "Molinism") oppose the beliefs of
Thomism.
