## LaHaye sues *Left Behind* film producers

Previous to the Left Behind film release in 2000, LaHaye sued
Namesake Entertainment and Cloud Ten Pictures in July, 1999,
claiming there had been a breach of contract. The suit said that
the producers told LaHaye that the budget for the movie's
production would be over $40 million. However, productions costs
came to $17.4 million.^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Quotes

-   "To suggest that the merciful, longsuffering, gracious and
    loving God of the Bible would invent a dreadful doctrine like
    Calvinism, which would have us believe it is an act of ‘grace’ to
    select only certain people for heaven and, by exclusion, others for
    hell, comes perilously close to blasphemy."
