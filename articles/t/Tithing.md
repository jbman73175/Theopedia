**Tithing** is the Old Testament duty of giving one-tenth of one's
earnings and/or resources to God. The word *tithe* comes from the
Old English word, "teotha", which means a tenth.
[[1]](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tithe) The Old Testament
word translated tithe is the Hebrew *ma'aser*. The New Testament
word translated tithe is the [Greek](Greek "Greek") *apodekatoo*.

"Every **tithe** of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of
the fruit of the trees, is the LORD's; it is holy to the LORD."
(Lev 27:30 ESV)
"You shall **tithe** all the yield of your seed that comes from the
field year by year." (Deut. 14:22 ESV)

## Is tithing applicable to the N.T. Church?

### Some say "Not as such"

Tithing in the sense of a requirement to give a "tenth" to God is
part of the [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") Law. It
is not taught as such in the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"). The only times
"tithing" is mentioned in the New Testament, it is referring to
usage under the O.T. economy. When the New Testament speaks about
"giving," it goes against "tithing" as a
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") or a
[legalistic](Legalism "Legalism") requirement.

The [apostle Paul](Apostle_Paul "Apostle Paul") also says in 1 Cor.
16:2, "On the first day of every week, each of you is to put
something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that there
will be no collecting when I come." (ESV) This is not *tithing*,
only giving as one has purposed in his heart and as one has
prospered, you choose the amount.

Again in 2 Cor. 9:7, Paul says, "Each one must give as he has made
up his mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a
cheerful giver." (ESV) There is no amount mentioned, it is what you
have settled in your own heart.

### Some say "Yes"

The following is taken from
[The Geneva Institute for Reformed Studies](http://www.girs.com/library/theology/syllabus/nom3b.html)
"Under the Old Testament priestly system the tithes and offerings
were to be brought to the priests who acted as the elders of Israel
to provide for and oversee the worship, to counsel and discipline
the members, and to care for the needy in the covenant community.
The admonition of Malachai 3:10 to bring the whole tithe into the
storehouse, reminds us that the tithe is to be distributed and used
under the authority of God's church, not to the individual."

"In the New Testament this same principle continues with no change
except that the temple services and priestly work were completed in
Christ. The day of worship was set by the Apostles to the first day
of the week based on the Roman calendar that was in use at the
time. Therefore we see the worshippers instructed to bring God's
tithes and their offerings to the Sabbath worship of the church (1
Corinthians 16:1-2 and 2 Corinthians 8-9)."
