## Quotes

-   The New Testament authors sometimes use titles that remind us
    of either the human nature or the divine nature in order to speak
    of the person of Christ, even though the action mentioned may be
    done only bythe other nature than the one we might think of from
    the title. For example, Paul says that if the rulers of this world
    had understood the wisdom of God, they would not have crucified the
    Lord of glory (1 Cor. 2:8). Now when we see the phrase the Lord of
    glory it reminds us specifically of Jesus divine nature. But Paul
    uses this title (probably intentionally to show the horrible evil
    of the crucifixion) to say that Jesus was crucified. Even though
    Jesus divine nature was not crucified, it was true of Jesus as a
    person that he was crucified, and Paul affirms that about him even
    though he uses the title the Lord of glory.
