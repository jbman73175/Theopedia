"Four Friends. One Passion" is the strapline on the Together For
the Gospel website. Not an organisation as such, T4G as it is
affectionately known is a conference and movement which has grown
out of the friendships of four men with very different backgrounds
in the church. [Mark Dever](Mark_Dever "Mark Dever"),
[Albert Mohler](Albert_Mohler "Albert Mohler"),
[C.J. Mahaney](C.J._Mahaney "C.J. Mahaney"), and
[Ligon Duncan](Ligon_Duncan "Ligon Duncan") respect each other and
feel that the friendships they have forged support their individual
ministries which range from the radio station to the presbyterian
church, and from the Southern Baptists to the
[charismatic](Charismatic "Charismatic") movement.

The first conference sold out and included special guests
[John Piper](John_Piper "John Piper"),
[R.C.Sproul](index.php?title=R.C.Sproul&action=edit&redlink=1 "R.C.Sproul (page does not exist)")
and [John MacArthur](John_MacArthur "John MacArthur"). In 2008 they
will also be joined by
[Thabiti Anyabwile](index.php?title=Thabiti_Anyabwile&action=edit&redlink=1 "Thabiti Anyabwile (page does not exist)")
