**Total depravity** (also called **total inability** or
**total corruption**) is a biblical [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine")
closely linked with the doctrine of
[original sin](Original_sin "Original sin") as formalized by
[Augustine](Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo") and advocated
in many Protestant confessions of faith and catechisms, especially
in [Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"). The doctrine understands the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") to teach that, as a consequence of the
[the Fall](The_Fall "The Fall") of man, every person born into the
world is morally corrupt, enslaved to [sin](Sin "Sin") and is,
apart from the grace of God, utterly unable to choose to follow
[God](God "God") or choose to turn to Christ in faith for
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation").

"And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once
walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of
the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of
disobedience—among whom we all once lived in the passions of our
flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were
by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind." (Ephesians
2:1-3, [ESV](ESV "ESV"))

## Summary of the doctrine

The doctrine of total inability teaches that people are not by
nature inclined to love [God](God "God") with their whole heart,
mind, or strength, as he requires, but rather all are inclined to
serve their own interests and to reject the rule of God. Even
religion and philanthropy are destructive to the extent that these
originate from a human imagination, passions, and will.

Total depravity does not mean, however, that people are as bad as
possible. Rather, it means that even the good which a person may
intend is faulty in its premise, false in its motive, and weak in
its implementation; and there is no mere refinement of natural
capacities that can correct this condition. Although total
depravity is easily confused with philosophical cynicism, the
doctrine teaches optimism concerning God's love for what he has
made and God's ability to accomplish the ultimate good that he
intends for his creation. In particular, in the process of
[salvation](Salvation "Salvation"), it is argued that God overcomes
man's inability with his divine grace and enables men and women to
choose to follow him, though the precise means of this overcoming
varies between the theological systems.

### Biblical evidence for the doctrine

A number of passages are put forth to support the doctrine,
including (quotations are from the [ESV](ESV "ESV") except where
noted):

-   [Genesis](Genesis "Genesis") 6:5: "The LORD saw that the
    wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention
    of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."
-   [Jeremiah](Book_of_Jeremiah "Book of Jeremiah") 13:23
    ([NIV](NIV "NIV")): "Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the
    leopard its spots? Neither can you do good who are accustomed to
    doing evil."
-   [John](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John") 6:44a: "No one can come
    to me unless the Father who sent me draws him."
-   [Romans](Epistle_to_the_Romans "Epistle to the Romans")
    3:10-11: "None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no
    one seeks for God."
-   Romans 8:7-9: "For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile
    to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.
    Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are not
    in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells
    in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not
    belong to him."
-   [Ephesians](Epistle_to_the_Ephesians "Epistle to the Ephesians")
    2:3b: "[We] were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of
    mankind."
-   [1 Corinthians](First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians "First Epistle to the Corinthians")
    2:14: "The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit
    of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand
    them because they are spiritually discerned."

## Aspects

### Total inability

In [John 6](John_6 "John 6") Jesus said that, "No one can come to
me unless the Father who sent me draws him... This is why I told
you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the
Father." Apart from Christ, man is foolish, dead in sin (Ephesians
2:1-3), enslaved to sin (Romans 6:17), and following the spirit of
the power of the air (Ephesians 2:2). "A natural man does not
accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to
him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually
appraised" (1 Corinthians 2:14). His wisdom is demonic and earthly
(James 3:15). He cannot hear the word of Christ and God (John 8:43,
47). He is not able to subject his flesh to the law of God (Romans
8:7-8). Just as people cannot change the color of their skin, those
who are accustomed to doing evil cannot do good (Jeremiah 13:23).
Every intention of the thoughts of man's heart are only evil
continually (Genesis 6:5). The intention of man's heart is evil
from his youth (Genesis 8:21). Surely we were brought forth in
iniquity, and in sin were we conceived (Psalms 51:5)!

Contrary to the doctrine of
[universal prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace"),
all of these passages show that, apart from being in Christ, our
total depravity is actual and not hypothetical.

### Extent and degree

[Tim Challies](Tim_Challies "Tim Challies") writes, "We can put one
drop of deadly poison in that glass and it renders that entire
glass poisonous so that if you were to drink it, you would quickly
drop dead. That one drop extended to every part of the glass even
though the entire vessel is not filled with poison. This represents
humans after the Fall. While they are not wholly corrupt, the
corruption they do have extends to every part. And finally consider
a third glass which is filled entirely with poison. From top to
bottom there is nothing but deadly poison. This represents Satan,
who the Bible portrays as being absolutely corrupt so there is no
good left whatsoever, but this does not represent humans here on
earth. Humans are not as depraved as they could possibly
be."^[[1]](#note-0)^

### Deserving of eternal punishment

See Matthew 25:46, Jude 1:7, and 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9.

"The reality of hell is God's clear indictment of the infiniteness
of our guilt. If our corruption were not deserving of an eternal
punishment God would be unjust to threaten us with a punishment so
severe as eternal torment." – [John Piper](John_Piper "John Piper")
## Common objections

### Faith precedes regeneration

Some object to the Calvinist understanding (that regeneration
precedes faith) and contend that faith comes before
[conversion](Conversion "Conversion"). Their position maintains
that the Holy Spirit "regenerates" those who have believed; in
other words, "I must put my faith in Christ, and *then* conversion
will take place." However, the Bible says that one must first be
called/drawn, and *then* he is able to trust in Jesus. In 1 Cor.
2:14, Paul says that the natural (unregenerate) man *cannot*
understand the things of the Spirit. Saving faith is actually the
first act of the (regenerate) new creature in Christ. We choose
Christ because he first chose us.

*See also: [Regeneration](Regeneration "Regeneration") and [Monergism](Monergism "Monergism")*
### Libertarian freedom and universal prevenient grace

Some affirm that man *would* be bound by a sinful nature, a kind of
depravity in which he is in bondage to and cannot escape. However,
they say, to keep with
[libertarian freedom](Libertarian_freedom "Libertarian freedom"),
God gives man
[universal prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace")
in which he is able to escape just enough from his sinful nature
and have the ability to choose.

### Command implies moral ability

"Why would we be commanded to follow Jesus if we were not able to
do so?" some have asked. The Bible is clear, however, that the law
brings wrath and was added "that sin might increase" (Romans 5:20;
Romans 7:13-14). Precisely because man cannot obey the
[law](Law "Law"), it was commanded. This was to show our utter
dependence on God's grace.

The Scriptures *do* teach that man is responsible, but they also
teach that he is unable to turn from sin and trust in Christ if
left to himself. The idea that responsibility implies ability is
not a scriptural idea. The biblical commands to repent and believe
(just like the commands to obey) do not imply ability. The command
is based on man’s responsibility (i.e. his duty or obligation) and
what he ought to do; and *ought* does not imply *can*. Human
ability is not prerequisite to responsibility nor implied by the
commands of Scripture.

### Necessarily implies utter depravity

Others have objected that if we agree with Total Depravity then we
are saying that any unregenerate person is incapable of making good
choices. (See [Common grace](Common_grace "Common grace"))
