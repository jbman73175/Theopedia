language.

## Type of tower

The Tower of Babel was not an attempt to physically reach heaven,
but was rather a temple, whose "top is in the heavens". (Genesis
11:4 NKJV) Ancient Mesopotamian ziggurat temple-towers' top
compartment represented heaven, and it seems the same is most
likely the case for the Tower of Babel.^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Reason for building the tower

The city and tower of Babel were built by people who were rebelling
against God, by directly contradicting his command to "Be fruitful
and multiply and fill the earth." The purpose of building the tower
was to "make a name for [them]selves", and to prevent them from
being "dispersed over the face of the whole earth." (Genesis 11:4)
By building a city to not be dispersed, and a tower to make a name
for themselves, the people of Babel were defying God.

## God's response

Genesis 11:5-8 describe God's response to the pride and arrogance
of the people. He notes that when all of humanity can conspire
together, the effects can be disastrous. Therefore, he confused
their language (Babel means confusion), and the people dispersed,
leaving the city unfinished.

## Effects of Babel

The many languages around the world today are a result of the
confusion of the language, and the dispersion of the people.
Languages today fit into one of twenty or so language families.
Both the languages in each family, and the people that speak them,
are shown to be genetically linked, while few links have been found
between families. This shows that both modern races, and modern
languages, are due to the confusion and dispersion of
Babel.^[[2]](#note-1)^
