**Traducianism** is one of two biblically plausible views on the
origin of the human soul (immaterial nature, spirit) following
God's initial creation and mankind's Fall. Traducianism is the
theory that human beings are propagated as whole beings, both
materially and immaterially (including both body and soul).
Creationism, on the other hand, is the view that God specially
creates a new soul *ex nihilo* when a human being is conceived.
Both views have their strengths and weaknesses and both have been
held by notable theologians of the past.

A third view, which lacks biblical support, proposes that God
created all human souls at the same time, prior to Genesis 1, and
*attaches* a soul to a human being at the moment of conception. In
other words, all the souls that will ever be were created and
pre-existent before Adam. This view is not generally accepted as an
orthodox option.

"Traducianism was held by [Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian") and
many Westerns; since the Reformation by Lutherans; also by the
Eastern church. Roman Catholics and most Reformed theologians are
creationists, though Shedd and Strong favor traducianism. Modern
studies in heredity and psychosomatic unity are indecisive, but can
easily be interpreted on the traducianist side."^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Traducianist view

Support for Traducianism is as follows:

-   In Genesis 2:7, God breathed the breath of life into Adam,
    causing Adam to become a “living soul.” Scripture nowhere records
    God performing this action again.
-   Adam had a son in his own likeness (Genesis 5:3). Adam’s
    descendants seem to be “living souls” without God breathing into
    them.
-   Genesis 2:2-3 seems to indicate that God ceased His creative
    work.
-   Adam's sin affects all men – both physically and spiritually –
    this makes sense if the body and soul both come from the parents.

The weakness of Traducianism is that it is unclear how an
immaterial soul can be generated from another soul.

Notable proponents of the Traducionist view include:
[W. G. T. Shedd](W._G._T._Shedd "W. G. T. Shedd")

## Creationist view

Creationism was held by many early church fathers and also has
scriptural support:

-   Scripture differentiates the origin of the soul from the origin
    of the body (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Isaiah 42:5; Zechariah 12:1;
    Hebrews 12:9).
-   If God creates each individual soul at the moment it is needed,
    the separation of soul and body is maintained.

The weakness of Creationism is that it has God continually creating
new human souls, while Genesis 2:2-3 indicates that God ceased
creating. Also, since the entire human existence, body, soul, and
spirit, are infected by sin – if God creates a new soul for every
human being, how is that soul then infected with sin?

Notable proponents of the Creationist view include:
