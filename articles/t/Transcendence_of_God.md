*"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways," declares the LORD. "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." (Isaiah 55:8-9, [NIV](NIV "NIV"))*
The **transcendence of God** is closely related to his
[sovereignty](Sovereignty_of_God "Sovereignty of God"). It means
that God is above, other than, and distinct from all he has made -
he *transcends* it all. [Paul](Paul "Paul") says that there is "one
God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all
(Ephesians 4:6). Scripture says elsewhere, "For you, O LORD, are
the Most High over all the earth; you are exalted far above all
gods (Psalms 97:9; cf. 108:5).

To affirm God's transcendence and deny his immanence is to arrive
at [deism](Deism "Deism"). To deny his transcendence and affirm his
immanence is to arrive at [pantheism](Pantheism "Pantheism").
