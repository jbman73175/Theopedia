The **transfiguration** refers to the event where
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") led [Peter](Peter "Peter"),
[James](James "James") and his brother
[John](John_the_Apostle "John the Apostle") to a mountain where he
was transfigured before their eyes (see Matthew 17:1-13; Mark
9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36; cf. 2 Pet 2:16-18 and Jn 1:14). The texts
also assert that [Moses](Moses "Moses") and
[Elijah](index.php?title=Elijah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Elijah (page does not exist)")
were present as well which add to the significance of this
occurrence. Both figures had eschatological (i.e. end times) roles:
Moses was a model for the eschatological prophet (cf. Deut 18:18),
and Elijah was understood to be the forerunner for the
[Messiah](Messiah "Messiah") (cf. Mal 4:5-6), and together they
summarize the Law and the Prophets. Furthermore, they both had a
vision of God's glory on a mountain: Moses at Sinai (Ex 31:18) and
Elijah at Horeb (1 Kgs 19:8). However, this time it is *Jesus'*
glory that is present and, by calling Jesus "my Son", the text
reveals that he supersedes both Moses and Elijah.
