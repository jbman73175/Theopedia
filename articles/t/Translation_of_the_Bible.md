Throughout history, the text of the [Bible](Bible "Bible") has been
translated into many different languages so that peoples of all
cultures and times can understand God's redemption story for His
chosen people. The [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament")
was mostly written in [Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew"), except for
example, a few sections in the
[book of Daniel](Book_of_Daniel "Book of Daniel") that were written
in [Aramaic](Aramaic "Aramaic"). The
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") was originally
written in [Koine Greek](Koine_Greek "Koine Greek").

There are even times when people in the Bible are found
interpreting and explaining the scripture so others around can
understand it. While they may not have been translating, when Ezra
was reading the law of God to the people of Israel who has gathered
around, he had others with him that were helping explain and
interpret the law.

Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah,
Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites,
helped the people to understand the Law, while the people remained
in their places. They read from the book, from the Law of God,
clearly, and they gave the sense, so that the people understood the
reading. (Nehemiah 8:7-8)
