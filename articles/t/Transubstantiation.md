The [Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholicism "Roman Catholicism")
doctrine that the bread and wine, used in the Lord's Supper or
[Eucharist](Eucharist "Eucharist"), actually become the literal
body and blood of [Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") at the
"consecration" by the ordained priest. This is based on a
super-literal reading of Christ's words, "This is my body, which is
broken for you" (1 Corinthians 11:24, KJV); and on His Johannine
discourse, "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink
his blood, ye have no life in you" (John 6:53, [KJV](KJV "KJV")).

Roman Catholics believe that "by the words,
*Do this in commemoration of me* (Luke 22:19; 1 Corinthians 11:24),
Christ made the apostles priests. Moreover, He decreed that they
and other priests should offer His Body and Blood."

This doctrine should not be confused with the Lutheran doctrine of
[Consubstantiation](Consubstantiation "Consubstantiation").
