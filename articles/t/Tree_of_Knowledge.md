The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is in Genesis 2:9 and
Genesis 2:17.

From Genesis 2:9,
[King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version"), "And
out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is
pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in
the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and
evil."

From Genesis 2:17, King James Version, "But of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the
day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
