"For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been
from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be."
(Matthew 24:21)
Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these,
clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?” I said to
him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones coming
out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made
them white in the blood of the Lamb. (Revelation 7:13, 14)
The **Great Tribulation** is the specific event of God's judgment
carried out upon the earth "immediately"^[[1]](#note-0)^ prior to
the second coming of Christ in glory.

In the futurist scheme of Christian eschatology, the Tribulation is
a relatively short period of worldwide persecution and judgment
leading up to the [Second coming](Second_coming "Second coming") of
Jesus Christ. For Historic and Dispensational
[Premillennialists](Premillennialism "Premillennialism"), this also
precedes the establishment of his earthly
[Millennial Kingdom](Millennial_Kingdom "Millennial Kingdom").

More specifically, the tribulation is seen as corresponding to
Daniel's "seventieth week" and lasting 3.5 years -- the seven years
of the "seventieth week" is divided into two periods of 3.5 years,
the first 3.5 years are believed to be a time of security but the
last 3.5 years is identified as "the Great Tribulation" a time of
severe persecution of God's people.

The time period for these beliefs is based on the phrase "time,
times, and half a time" found several places in the book of Daniel
(e.g. Daniel 12:5-7), and interpreted as "a year, two years, and
half a year." The phrase also occurs in Revelation 12:14, with the
related periods of a "thousand two hundred and threescore days" in
Rev. 12:6, and "forty-two months" in Rev. 13:5. The "thousand two
hundred and sixty days" and "forty and two months" are seen as
prophetic months (averaging 30 days), hence 1260/30 = 42 months or
3.5 years.

## Alternate views

In the Christian [preterist](Preterism "Preterism") view the
Tribulation took place in the past when Roman legions destroyed
Jerusalem and its temple in 70 CE, and it affected the Jewish
people rather than all mankind. This is a view that is growing in
influence among certain scholars and theologians.

Such a view is also held many
[amillennialists](Amillennialist "Amillennialist"), although of
course, they would dispute the extreme preterist belief that this
also included the Second Coming. Riddlebarger notes that, although
"Jesus' prophetic warning clearly referred to the destruction of
Jerusalem" (p. 170), yet "the possibility of double fulfillment
surfaces again" (p. 171), suggesting that God's church will suffer
its greatest tribulation during an apostasy to occur just before
the Second Coming.

In the Christian
[historicist](index.php?title=Historicist&action=edit&redlink=1 "Historicist (page does not exist)")
view also, the Tribulation came upon the Jewish people, beginning
in 70 CE. This approach was taken by Martin Luther and John Calvin,
and prevailed among Protestants from the Reformation until the rise
of dispensationalism. Some modern historicists see the Tribulation
as continuing upon the Jews through the centuries, perhaps
culminating in the Holocaust, and ending with the restoration of
the state of Israel or the return of Jerusalem to Jewish control.
