The **Tridentine Creed** was proclaimed by Pope Pius IV in 1563 as
a
[counter-reformation](Catholic_Reformation "Catholic Reformation")
initiative from the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") church at the
[Council of Trent](Council_of_Trent "Council of Trent"), and
remains accepted doctrine of that church.

It was intended to remedy a perceived lack of systematic knowledge
among the clergy which left them vulnerable to the
widely-distributed publications of the reformers. For protestants,
it stands as an itemization of the core issues that made the
reformation essential for the renewal of the church.

The Tridentine Creed was solemnly affirmed during the Vatican
Council of 1870 at its second session. Since that time the Roman
Catholic Church has added two articles which enter into the
"Tridentine Profession of Faith," one on the sinlessness of the
Virgin Mary, and one on the infallibility of the pope.
