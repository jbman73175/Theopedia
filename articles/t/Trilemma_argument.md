The **Trilemma argument** states that if the Biblical statements
about [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") are taken seriously, then Jesus can
only be thought of as Lord, Liar, or Lunatic.


## Evangelistic use

Despite its limitations of directly proving that Jesus Christ is
[God](God "God") *ultimately*, this argument does show that that
conclusion is the only Biblical one. For example, in a conversation
with an unbeliever who thinks that Jesus was only a good man and
nothing more, one could use this argument to show that He could not
be merely a good man according to the Bible. It can be used to
"open one's eyes" to acknowledging the bare truth that the gospel
writers have expressed about Jesus.
