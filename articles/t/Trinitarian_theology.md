**Trinitarian theology** is a "summary label" for an approach to
theology where the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity") is the originating
impulse and organizing principle for other doctrines of the
Christian faith. As
[Christoph Schwöbel](Christoph_Schwöbel "Christoph Schwöbel") has
stated, "it is difficult to point to any one area of theological
reflection that is not potentially affected by being viewed from a
trinitarian perspective." [^1]
