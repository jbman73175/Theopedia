The **Trinity** is the [Christian](Christian "Christian")
[doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") that deals with and describes the
[nature](Nature "Nature") of [God](God "God"). The doctrine asserts
the following:

-   There is one and only [one God](Monotheism "Monotheism").
-   God eternally exists in three distinct persons.
-   The [Father](God_the_Father "God the Father") is God, the
    [Son](Jesus "Jesus") is God, and the
    [Holy Spirit](Holy_Spirit "Holy Spirit") is God.
-   The Father is not the Son, the Son is not the Father, the
    Father is not the Spirit, etc.

## A brief history

The doctrine of the Trinity was formally developed in the early
church in reaction to errant teaching on the nature of God as found
in [Arianism](Arianism "Arianism"). Arianism attempted to protect
monotheism (the belief in one God) by denying the full
[deity of Jesus](Deity_of_Jesus "Deity of Jesus"), a belief most
Christians held at this time. Arianism taught that Jesus was
divine, but that he was a lesser deity than the
[Father](God_the_Father "God the Father"). To affirm the Church's
stance on the nature of God, the Trinity was formally stated in the
[Nicene Creed](Nicene_Creed "Nicene Creed") (325 A.D.) and the
later [Athanasian Creed](Athanasian_Creed "Athanasian Creed"). As a
result of these early ecumenical creeds, any departure from the
Christian [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") of the Trinity was
considered [heresy](Heresy "Heresy"). These creeds affirm the early
Christian conviction that Jesus was God. Arianism caused the church
to dogmatically affirm what was already believed and inherent to
the earliest of Christian theology.

The term "Trinity", is not found in the [Bible](Bible "Bible").
Theophilus of Antioch around 180 A.D. first used the Greek term
*trias* (a set of three) in reference to God, his Word, and his
Wisdom. However, [Tertullian](Tertullian "Tertullian") in 215 A.D.
was the first one to state this doctrine using the Latin term,
*Trinitas* (Trinity), referring to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
(W. Fulton in the *Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics*).

*See main page: [Development of Trinitarian theology](Development_of_Trinitarian_theology "Development of Trinitarian theology")*

## Understanding the terms

In Trinitarianism, God is said to be three persons in one essence,
nature, or being. These last three terms are often seen as
synonymous, but it can be helpful to understand what each means
independently. Theological explanations of the Trinity, especially
as developed in the early church, included the use of certain Greek
terms which are included below for reference.

### Essence

The word "essence" may be defined as the intrinsic or indispensable
properties that serve to characterize or identify
something.[[1]](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/) Essence
describes what it is to be God. The three persons of the Godhead
share the **same** essence, and God's essence is
[immaterial](Immateriality_of_God "Immateriality of God"). With
this understanding, the doctrine of the Trinity continues to assert
[monotheism](Monotheism "Monotheism"), an essential and easily
found belief within Scripture.

*See main page on [essence](Essence "Essence")*
### Nature

The word "nature" may be defined as the essential characteristics
and qualities of a person or
thing.[[2]](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/) Sometimes "nature"
is synonymous with "essence." [Ontologically](Ontology "Ontology"),
each of the three members of the Trinity possess the same essential
nature.

*See main page on [nature](Nature "Nature")*
### Being

The word "being" may be defined as the state or quality of having
existence.[[3]](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/) The triune God
of Scripture eternally exists and has eternal being. Again, along
with a monotheistic understanding, there is **one and only one**
being, that is, God.

*See main page on [being](Being "Being")*
### Person

The word "person" may be defined as the composite of
characteristics that make up an individual
personality.[[4]](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/) Scripture
presents separate individualities of the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, as distinguished from the "essence" of the Godhead that
unites them.

*See main page on [person](Person "Person")*
### Homoousios

*Homoousios* is a [Greek](Greek "Greek") term that means "of the
same substance". It was used against
[Arianism](Arianism "Arianism") to define the relationship of
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") and
[God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father"). They were of the
same substance, or in other words, were of the same
[being](Being "Being").

*See main page on [Homoousios](Homoousios "Homoousios")*
### Heteroousios

The [Greek](Greek "Greek") term *heteroousios* was used by
[Arius](Arius "Arius") to describe the [nature](Nature "Nature") of
[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus"). It means "of a different substance" and
thus [Arianism](Arianism "Arianism") seeks to describe Jesus as
being separate from
[God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father"). Reactions
escalated and resulted in the
[Council of Nicea](Council_of_Nicea "Council of Nicea") where it
was affirmed that Jesus and the Father were of the same substance
([homoousios](Homoousios "Homoousios")).

*See main page on [Heteroousios](Heteroousios "Heteroousios")*
### Homoiousios

Used by [Eusebius](Eusebius "Eusebius") of Caesarea, *homoiousios*
means "of a similar substance". This is in contrast to the Nicene
affirmation that [Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") and
[God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father") are
[homoousios](Homoousios "Homoousios"), "of the same substance."
Christians at that time believed that even if they were of
*similar* substance, the result was a Jesus who was *not* identical
with the redemptive God of the Old Testament. Furthermore, if he
had a similar divine substance, an immediate problem arises with
the doctrine of [monotheism](Monotheism "Monotheism"). Thus, at the
[Council of Nicea](Council_of_Nicea "Council of Nicea") the church
affirmed that Jesus and the Father were of the *same* substance.

*See main page on [homoiousios](Homoiousios "Homoiousios")*
### Perichoresis

*Perichoresis* is a [Greek](Greek "Greek") term used to describe
the triune relationship between each [person](Person "Person") of
the [Godhead](Godhead "Godhead"). It can be defined as
co-indwelling, co-inhering, and mutual interpenetration.
[Charles Hodge](Charles_Hodge "Charles Hodge") explains that this
term was used "to express the Scriptural facts that the Son is in
the Father, and the Father in the Son; that where the Father is,
there the Son and Spirit are; that what the one does the others do
(the Father creates, the Son creates, the Spirit creates), or, as
our Lord expresses it, '[whatever the Father does, that the Son
does likewise]' (John 5:19). So also what the one knows, the others
know. '[For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.
For who knows a personâ€™s thoughts except the spirit of that person,
which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God
except the Spirit of God]' (1 Cor. 2:10, 11)."
[[5]](http://www.dabar.org/Theology/Hodge/HodgeV1/P1_C06.htm)

*See main page on [perichoresis](Perichoresis "Perichoresis")*
## Monotheism

Essential to the Trinity is that there is one and *only* one God.
It is essential because it was the conviction of
[monotheism](Monotheism "Monotheism") - that there is one God -
that drove the early Christians to formulate the doctrine of the
Trinity from Scripture. More importantly, monotheism is the
teaching found in the [Bible](Bible "Bible").

Scripture is clear that there is only one God: 'There is no other
God besides me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none besides
me. Turn to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth! For I am
God, and there is no other (Isaiah 45:21-22; see also 44:6-8;
Exodus 15:11; Deuteronomy 4:35; 6:4-5; 32:39; 1 Samuel 2:2; 1 Kings
8:60).

Fundamental to the Judaism of the OT (and of today) is the *shema*.
It is found in Deuteronomy 6 and part of it says, "Hear, O Israel:
The LORD our God, the LORD is one," (Deut 6:4). The understanding
of monotheism is at the heart of this passage, and it was at the
core of the early Christians understanding of the nature of God.

## Each person of the Trinity is God

The doctrine of the Trinity must remain grounded in God's Word.
[Roger Olson](Roger_Olson "Roger Olson") sums it up when he says,

"While it is true that no passage of Scripture spells out the
doctrine of the Trinity, it is also true that the whole of
Scripture's witness to who God is and who Jesus Christ and the Holy
Spirit are makes no sense at all without the model of the Trinity
and that all alternative concepts end up doing violence to some
essential aspect of revelation, Christian experience and possibly
even reason itself," (*The Mosaic of Christian Belief*, p. 139).
### The Father is God

*See main page: [God the Father](God_the_Father "God the Father")*
### Jesus/the Son is God

*See main page: [Deity of Jesus](Deity_of_Jesus "Deity of Jesus")*
### The Holy Spirit is God

*See main page: [Deity of the Holy Spirit](Deity_of_the_Holy_Spirit "Deity of the Holy Spirit")*
### Passages equating the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit

-   Matthew 28:19 - "Go therefore and make disciples of all
    nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
    and of the Holy Spirit"
    -   This passage suggests that these three Persons share the same
        name.

-   2 Corinthians 13:14 - "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the
    love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
    Amen."
    -   Here, again, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are
        equated. Observe that frequently the Father is spoken of as "God"
        in reference to the Son because of the covenant between the Father
        and the Son.

-   Revelation 1:4-5 - "John to the seven churches which are in
    Asia: Grace to you, and peace from Him who is and who was and who
    is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before the throne,
    and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the first-born of the
    dead, and the ruler of kings on earth."
    -   The
        [Apostolic Greeting](index.php?title=Apostolic_Greeting&action=edit&redlink=1 "Apostolic Greeting (page does not exist)")
        only involves members of the Godhead. The seven spirits who are
        before the throne is evidently a way of referring to the Holy
        Spirit who is present wherever the church is present.

## Misconceptions about the Trinity

[Colin Gunton](Colin_Gunton "Colin Gunton") (1941 - 2003) asserts
that, "Trinitarian theology is not a theory; it is an account of
God's being which is tied to his action, and that action centres on
a gospel rooted in the life, suffering and resurrection of Jesus,"
(*Father, Son & Holy Spirit*, xiv).

## Trinitarian heresies

Various heresies arose throughout the history of the church, many
of which would require significant replies in order to defend the
orthodox and biblical view of the one triune God. It is also
important to remember that "heretics did not work outside the
Christian community - they counted themselves as faithful
Christians attempting to explain the gospel in terms their
contemporaries might understand" (Gonzalez,
*A History of Christian Thought*, p. 121). That is, some heretics
would ascribe to "one God" but would mean something different than
what orthodox Christians taught. Thus it was important to work
through doctrines carefully and to protect each detail, whether it
be monotheism or the humanity of Jesus.

### Denial of the oneness and uniqueness of God

These result from a denial of the statement, "There is only one
God."

-   [Polytheism](Polytheism "Polytheism")
    -   [Mormonism](Mormonism "Mormonism")


### Denial of the eternal deity of each Person

These result from a denial of the statement, "Each Person is fully
God".

-   [Adoptionism](Adoptionism "Adoptionism")
-   [Arianism](Arianism "Arianism")
    -   [Jehovah's Witnesses](Jehovah's_Witnesses "Jehovah's Witnesses")

-   [Apollinarianism](Apollinarianism "Apollinarianism")

### Denial of the three Personalities or Persons

These result from a denial of the statement, "The Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit are distinct, eternal Persons".

-   [Modalism](Modalism "Modalism")
    -   [Patripassianism](Patripassianism "Patripassianism")
    -   [Branhamism](Branhamism#Modalism "Branhamism")
    -   [The Local Church](The_Local_Church "The Local Church") (or
        "[Living Stream Ministry](Living_Stream_Ministry "Living Stream Ministry")")

-   [Monarchism](Monarchism "Monarchism")

### Denial of the two, distinct, unmingled natures of Christ

-   [Nestorianism](Nestorianism "Nestorianism")
-   [Eutychianism](Eutychianism "Eutychianism")

## Implications
