## Mission

Trinity Evangelical Divinity School exists to serve the church of
the Living God by equipping servants for the work of the gospel of
Christ worldwide.

## Enrollment

Trinity Evangelical Divinity School (TEDS) is a learning community
dedicated to the development of servant leaders for the global
church, leaders who are spiritually, biblically, and theologically
prepared to engage contemporary culture for the sake of Christ's
kingdom. TEDS, one of the largest seminaries in the world, enrolls
more than 1,200 graduate students in professional and academic
programs, including more than 150 in its PhD programs. At the heart
of the divinity school lies the Master of Divinity degree,
preparing pastors, teachers, and missionaries for many kinds of
service. TEDS also offers a range of more focused Master of Arts
programs in counseling ministries, Christian thought, New
Testament, Old Testament, and other disciplines. The school offers
the ThM and DMin as well. Three academic PhD programs cover six
departments: Educational Studies, Intercultural Studies, and
Theological Studies (OT, NT, Systematic Theology, Historical
Theology).

## History

Trinity International University traces its roots to 1897 when the
Swedish Evangelical Free Church began a ten-week Bible course in
the basement of a Chicago church. This soon developed into the
Bible Institute of the Swedish Evangelical Free Church of America.
In 1884 the Norwegian-Danish Free Church Association had begun the
Norwegian-Danish department of the Chicago Theological Seminary. In
1910 the department withdrew from the seminary and established the
Norwegian-Danish Bible Institute and Academy—located first in
Rushford, Minnesota, and then later in Minneapolis with the name
Trinity Seminary and Bible Institute. Between 1946 and 1949 the
Swedish school merged with the Norwegian-Danish school to form
Trinity Seminary and Bible College, located in Chicago.

During the 1960s the seminary (renamed Trinity Evangelical Divinity
School) and the college (renamed Trinity College) moved to their
present Deerfield Campus. In 1992 the college established a
regional center in Davie, Florida, where the former Miami Christian
College became Trinity College at Miami. In 1995, Trinity College,
Trinity College at Miami, and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School
were united to form Trinity International University. With the
inauguration of the university, Trinity College in Deerfield became
the College of Arts and Sciences and Trinity College at Miami
became Trinity International University–Florida Campus. In 1997 the
first class entered Trinity Graduate School. Trinity Law School,
located in Santa Ana, California, incorporated into Trinity
International University in January 1998. Trinity Law School is
accredited with the State Bar of California and is moving toward
application for American Bar Association accreditation. The
residential undergraduate program in Miami closed in 2000 and the
undergraduate and graduate programs were renamed the Trinity
International University–Florida Regional Center. In 2002 the
College of Arts and Sciences was renamed Trinity College.
