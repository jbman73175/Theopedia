The **two natures of Jesus** refers to the doctrine that the one
person [Jesus Christ](Jesus_Christ "Jesus Christ") had/has two
natures, [divine](Deity_of_Jesus "Deity of Jesus") and
[human](Humanity_of_Jesus "Humanity of Jesus"). In theology this is
called the doctrine of the *hypostatic union*, from the Greek word
*hypostasis* (which came to mean *substantive reality*).
[Early church](Early_church "Early church") figures such as
[Athanasius](Athanasius "Athanasius") used the term "hypostatic
union" to describe the teaching that these two distinct natures
(divine and human) co-existed substantively and in reality in the
single person of Jesus Christ. The aim was to defend the doctrine
that Jesus was simultaneously truly God and truly man.

## Historical development

The doctrine of the hypostatic union (the two natures of Jesus) was
adopted as orthodox doctrine at the
[Council of Chalcedon](Council_of_Chalcedon "Council of Chalcedon")
in 451. Three major schools of theology were involved at the
council: Alexandria, Antioch, and the West. The consensus of these
three schools in the
[Chalcedonian Creed](Chalcedonian_Creed "Chalcedonian Creed")
illustrates the catholicity (i.e. universality) of the ancient
church. ^[[1]](#note-0)^ The creed asserted two distinct natures,
human and divine, and affirmed the one person of Jesus Christ.

*See main page: Chalcedonian Creed*
## Biblical basis

One of the clearest passages in Scripture concerning the two
natures of Jesus comes from John 1
*[(see on John 1)](John_1 "John 1")*. The Word (i.e. Jesus) "was
with God, and the Word was God." Moreover, the Word took on human
flesh (John 1:14). [Luke's gospel](Gospel_of_Luke "Gospel of Luke")
also says that Jesus "increased in wisdom and in stature and in
favor with God and man" (Luke 2:52).

## Two minds and wills, or one?

"Some conclude that when Jesus took on his human nature he
possessed two minds, a human mind and a Divine mind, with the human
mind responsible for Jesus' knowledge rather than the Divine mind.
Others hold that Jesus had one mind but while in his mortal body he
chose to have a subconscious mental part that was inaccessible to
the conscious mind and then, after his resurrection, his humanity
became dominated by the Divine so his subconscious became
accessible."^[[2]](#note-1)^
For an example of the "two minds view", see
*The Logic of God Incarnate*, by Thomas Morris. For the "divided
mind" view, which speaks of "two systems of belief [in one mind] to
some extent independent of each other", see Richard Swinburne's
*Christian God*, p. 201^[[3]](#note-2)^. For a critique of these,
see "The Inclusion model of the Incarnation: Problems and
Prospects", by Tim Bayne^[[4]](#note-3)^.

The view that Jesus only has one will is called
[Monothelitism](Monothelitism "Monothelitism").

## Leo's "Tome"

*Leo's Tome* refers to a letter in 449 from Pope Leo I to Flavian,
Patriarch of Constantinople, expounding the orthodox Christology of
the West. In
[this letter](http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf212.ii.iv.xxviii.html)
Leo maintains that Jesus Christ is one person of the divine Trinity
with two distinct natures that are permanently united. These two
natures share properties through the so-called communicatio
idiomatum or sharing of attributes between the divine and human
natures of Christ. Alexandrian theologians favored this concept. It
was used, but found less favor among Antiochene theologians. Leo's
statement was directed specifically against the heresy of
[Eutychianism](Eutychianism "Eutychianism"). This letter was
recognized by the
[Council of Chalcedon](Council_of_Chalcedon "Council of Chalcedon")
(451) as a statement of orthodox Christology.

## The Communicatio Idiomatum

"A doctrine that is related to the Hypostatic Union is the
communicatio idiomatum (Latin for 'communication of properties').
It is the teaching that the attributes of both the divine and human
natures are ascribed to the one person of Jesus. This means that
the man Jesus could lay claim to the glory He had with the Father
before the world was made (John 17:5), claim that He descended from
heaven, (John 3:13), and also claim omnipresence, (Matt. 28:20).
All of these are divine qualities that are laid claim to by Jesus;
therefore, the attributes of the divine properties were claimed by
the person of Jesus."^[[5]](#note-4)^
## God and man forever

"Christ's humanity was not a mere fleshly shell that God rented and
used for a temporary amount of time. God did not just come to live
in flesh as a man, but the 'Word became flesh' (John 1:14). God
incorporated human nature into His eternal being. In the
incarnation humanity has been permanently incorporated into the
Godhead. God is now a man in addition to being God. At the virgin
conception God acquired an identity He would retain for the rest of
eternity. His human existence is both authentic and permanent.
Jesus' humanity is not something that can be discarded or dissolved
back into the Godhead, but He will always and forever exist in
heaven as a glorified man, albeit God at the same
time."^[[6]](#note-5)^
Upon his ascension, Jesus was not deified, but rather was
glorified.

## Contrasting views

A variety of events led up to Chalcedon, but there were three
opposing views that deserved the church's attention.
Apollinarianism, Nestorianism, and Eutychianism all challenged the
view that the one person of Christ included a human and divine
nature. While their goals may have been to unify the person or
natures, each view was condemned as [heresy](Heresy "Heresy").

### Apollinarianism

Apollinarians argued that in the
[Incarnation](Incarnation "Incarnation") the Son of God assumed a
human nature but not a human soul. Instead, his divine nature took
the place of the soul. This view diminished the full humanity of
Jesus and was condemned at the
[Council of Constantinople](First_Council_of_Constantinople "First Council of Constantinople")
in 381. This view is similar to [docetism](Docetism "Docetism").

*See main page: Apollinarianism*
### Nestorianism

Nestorianism insisted that there were two natures but that there
were also two persons: one divine and the other human. Rather than
unifying Jesus, this view separated the person of Jesus along with
his two natures.

*See main page: Nestorianism*
### Eutychianism

This view essentially absorbed the human nature into the divine
nature. In an attempt to unify the person of Jesus, Eutychianism
denied the two natures of Jesus and affirmed a new, or third,
nature. This issue is also similar to that of
[monophysitism](Monophysitism "Monophysitism") (*mono* - one;
*physis* - nature).

*See main page: Eutychianism*
## Monophysitism, Miaphysitism, and Dyophysitism

*This is a **[section stub](http://www.theopedia.com/Category:Theopedia_sectionstubs "Category:Theopedia sectionstubs")**. Please edit it to add information.*
Adherents of miaphysitism argue that it is different than
monophyistism, "mia standing for a composite unity unlike mone
standing for an elemental unity".^[[7]](#note-miaphysitism)^ They
argue:

"After the Union, Christ was no longer in two natures. The two
natures became united into one nature without separation, without
confusion and without change. Thus He was at the same tithe perfect
God and perfect man. This is the union of the natures in the
Incarnation. After the union Christ is not two persons or two
natures. but one Person, one incarnate Nature of God the Son, with
one will, but being at once divine and
human."^[[7]](#note-miaphysitism)^
The
[Council of Chalcedon](Council_of_Chalcedon "Council of Chalcedon")
resolutely affirmed dyophysitism over monophysitism and
miaphysitism, saying that Christ had *two* inseparable natures in
one person.
