"**Tychicus**, from the [Greek](Greek "Greek") *Tychikos*, meaning
chance or fortuitous, was a close friend and assistant to the
[apostle](Apostle "Apostle") [Paul](Paul "Paul"). Tychicus was with
Paul during his journey from Macedonia to Jerusalem, and later
helped Paul when the apostle was imprisoned in Rome, before Paul
sent him to Ephesus. Often unknown or overlooked by students of
Bible History, Tychicus was certainly highly regarded by Paul, who
referred to him as a "beloved brother and faithful minister in the
Lord" (Ephesians 6:21 RSV)."
