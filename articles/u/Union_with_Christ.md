The theme of **union with Christ** occurs in numerous places in the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament"), and is also
pictured in the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament").^[[1]](#note-0)^ It
is that union enjoyed by believers, individually and corporately,
with the [Lord Jesus](Lord_Jesus "Lord Jesus"). It is sometimes
referred to as the *unio mystica* or *mystic union*, as its fact is
established without understanding the mechanism. Our union with
Christ is best understood by the picture-language used in the
[Bible](Bible "Bible"), and by the blessings we derive from our
union with Christ.

## The language of union with Christ

[Jesus](Jesus "Jesus") (in
[John's gospel](Gospel_of_John "Gospel of John")),
[John](John "John") and [Paul](Paul "Paul") all talked about union
with Christ, each using different language to point to the one
reality. There are also Old Testament and New Testament pictures of
union which point forward to the [antitype](Typology "Typology").

### Old Testament pictures

The most prevalent picture of union with Christ is that of being
clothed in another. [Adam](Adam "Adam") and [Eve](Eve "Eve"), naked
and ashamed in the [Garden](Garden_of_Eden "Garden of Eden"), are
clothed with garments of skin (Gen. 3:21) and
[Jacob](Jacob "Jacob") appears before his father in skins to appear
as though his brother,
[Esau](index.php?title=Esau&action=edit&redlink=1 "Esau (page does not exist)").
Adam and Eve's shame is covered through the death of another, and
Jacob only acquires blessing in his elder brother.

The [Psalms](Psalms "Psalms") also hint at union with God when they
talk of finding the LORD to be a fortress and a refuge (*e.g.* Ps.
18:2), while the later [Prophets](Prophet "Prophet") frequently use
the imagery of a husband and a wife to describe the relationship
between God and Israel, an image picked up in the New Testament.

### John

In John's gospel, Jesus describes himself as the Vine, and the
disciples as branches in him (John 15:1–17). This is an extended
metaphor, in which the [Father](God_the_Father "God the Father") is
the gardener, and Jesus describes how unfruitful branches will be
cut off, and that the only way to bear fruit is to remain in the
vine. Branches which wither or are cut off are thrown in to the
fire and burned, but the chosen branches will bear fruit which will
last. Jesus goes on to say that his disciples do not belong to the
world, but (by implication) they belong to him.

In his
[first epistle](First_Epistle_of_John "First Epistle of John"),
John picks up much of that language, writing "Those who obey his
commands live in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that
he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us." Union with
Christ means more than simply drawing one's life from Christ; it
means living in him. Further, through our union with Christ, we
enjoy union with the Father, since by seeing "that what you have
heard from the beginning remains in you … you also will remain in
the Son and in the Father." (1 John 2:24)

In the
[Book of Revelation](Book_of_Revelation "Book of Revelation"), John
"heard what sounded like a great multitude … shouting: 'Hallelujah!
… the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself
ready. Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear.' (Fine
linen stands for the righteous acts of the saints.)" (Rev. 19:6–8)
Once again, this picks up on previous language, but here it is the
Old Testament picture of being clothed with another which is
brought through.

### Paul

It is Paul's epistles that the fullest treatment of the theme of
union with Christ is to be found. That union is the bedrock of the
logic in [Romans](Epistle_to_the_Romans "Epistle to the Romans")
and the wellspring of praise in Ephesians. In Ephesians 2:20–21,
[Paul](Paul "Paul") uses the picture of building the
[Church](Church "Church") "on the foundation of the
[apostles](Apostle "Apostle") and [prophets](Prophet "Prophet"),
with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone. In him the
whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy
[temple](Temple "Temple") in the Lord." A similar picture can be
found in 1 Corinthians 3:10–11, where this time, Paul describes
Jesus himself as the foundation of the building, which seems to be
the Church, described a few verses later as God's temple.

In Ephesians 5:30–32, Paul describes the relationship of Christ and
the Church as being like that between a husband and wife. He also
likens the Church to a body, of which Christ is the Head. This
picture is developed in much more detail by Paul in 1 Corinthians
12:12–27, with particular respect to the importance of unity.

Another aspect of union with Christ is that of "Christ in us". Paul
uses such language in
[Galatians](Epistle_to_the_Galatians "Epistle to the Galatians"),
where he writes "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer
live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live
by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
(Gal. 2:20) To the Colossians, Paul writes that "God has chosen to
make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery,
which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." (Col. 1:27)

### Summary

The pictures taken as a whole, and considering other biblical
language, allow us to see that there are two components to union
with Christ: we in Christ, and Christ in us. It is a bond secured
through [faith](Faith "Faith") (Gal. 3:20, Eph. 3:17) and sealed in
[baptism](Baptism "Baptism") (Rom. 6:3–4, Gal. 3:26–27), and, as
Ephesians 1:3–14 tells us, is a [Trinitarian](Trinity "Trinity")
bond:

-   the Father is the source of our union;
-   the Son is the object of our union; and
-   the Spirit is the bond of our union.

## The blessings of union with Christ

The chief blessing of union with Christ is the blessing of the
promises of God, for it is in Christ that all God's promises are
"yea" and "amen", and when found in him, we become partakers of
those promises (Eph. 3:6). We may well say, then, that it is on
account of Christ that we enjoy all the good things God so richly
bestows. We shall divide the blessings under three heads: blessings
for believers with respect to God, with respect to one another and
with respect to themselves.

### Blessings to believers towards God

Grudem does well to observe that

> … every aspect of God's relationship to believers is in some way
> connected to our relationship with Christ. From God's counsels in
> eternity past before the world was created, to our fellowship with
> God in heaven in eternity future, and including every aspect of our
> relationship with God in this life—all has occurred in union with
> Christ. (p. 840)

Paul begins his meditation on union with Christ in Ephesians 1 with
a shout of "praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every
spiritual blessing in Christ!" In what follows, he explicitly
grounds [election](Election "Election") (4),
[adoption](Adoption "Adoption") (5), [grace](Grace "Grace") (6) and
[redemption](Redemption "Redemption") (7) "in Christ", culminating
in the first peak, looking towards the time when God will "bring
all things in heaven and on earth together under one head, even
Christ." He then begins again with election in Christ (11),
reminding the Ephesians that they, too, "were included in Christ
when [they] heard the word of truth, the [gospel](Gospel "Gospel")
of [their] salvation." (13)

In Romans 6–7, Paul expounds union with Christ with respect to sin
and the Law, showing us that we are dead to sin but alive to God in
Christ Jesus. His argument is that, since we died (in Christ) to
the Law, we died also to sin (since where there is no Law, there is
no sin), and are now under grace. We have also been raised to new
life in Christ's resurrection, and will, one day, be renewed in our
bodies, in the power of Christ's resurrection. This is part of the
hope of glory mentioned by Paul in his letter to the Colossians.

[Imputation](Imputation "Imputation"), of our sin to Christ, and
his righteousness to us, also occur in union with Christ: hiding in
him, the punishment for our sin falls on him; clothed in him, the
righteousness of his life becomes our own.

### Blessings to believers towards others

The main theme of union with Christ as it affects our relationships
is to promote unity in the Church: being united vertically with
Christ, we are naturally united horizontally with each other. In 1
Corinthians 12, Paul describes the different talents and gifts as
being analogous to different parts of the body: eyes, hands, feet
*etc.* Therefore, we should seek to build each other up in our
respective gifts.

In Galatians 3:28, Paul's argument is that, since all are one in
Christ Jesus, there is then "neither Jew nor Gentile, slave nor
free, male nor female"— there is no place for discrimination on the
basis of the status into which someone was born, as all are born
again into the same status in Christ.

### Blessings to believers towards themselves

When found in the Vine, branches enjoy growth and produce fruit.
Believers can be assured that, on the basis of their union with
Christ, they will experience a long-term pattern of growth, as
Christ in them conforms them to his likeness. Discipline is another
of the blessings of union with Christ, as we are pruned by the
Father so as to bear fruit. We also enjoy protection when found in
Christ, who makes himself our shield and stronghold. Paul's
wonderful description of the armour of God is truly the armour of
Christ, as each piece he describes is to be found only in union
with Jesus, who alone is truth and righteousness.

Finally, "our hearts are restless, until they find their rest in
thee" (attrib. [St. Augustine](St._Augustine "St. Augustine")). It
is only in Christ that we find our true identity, for he is the
true Man.
