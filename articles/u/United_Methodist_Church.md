The **United Methodist Church** is the largest Methodist
denomination, and the second-largest Protestant denomination in the
United States (after the Southern Baptist Convention). In 2004
worldwide membership was about 11 million members: 8.6 million in
the United States, 2.4 million in Africa, Asia and Europe.

The United Methodist Church (UMC) was formed in 1968 as a result of
a merger between the Evangelical United Brethren and the Methodist
Church which were themselves the result of mergers. The Methodist
Church was formed in 1939 as the result of a merger of the
Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South,
and the Methodist Protestant Church. The Evangelical United
Brethren Church was formed in 1946 as the result of a merger of the
United Brethren and the Evangelical Association.

## Background and beliefs

The first Methodist clergy were ordained by
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley"), a priest in the Church of
England, because of the crisis caused by the American Revolution
which cut the Methodists in the States off from the Church of
England and its sacraments.

United Methodist beliefs are similar to many mainline Protestant
denominations. Although United Methodist beliefs have evolved over
time, these beliefs can be traced to the writings of the church's
founders, [John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley") and Charles
Wesley (Methodist), Philip William Otterbein and Martin Boehm
(United Brethren), and Jacob Albright (Evangelical). With the
formation of the United Methodist Church in 1968, theologian Albert
C. Outler led the team which systematized denominational doctrine.
Outler's work proved pivotal in the work of union, and he is
largely considered the first United Methodist theologian.

The officially established Doctrinal Standards of United Methodism
are:

-   the Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church;
-   the Confession of Faith (United Methodist) of the Evangelical
    United Brethren Church;
-   the General Rules of the Methodist Societies;
-   the Standard Sermons of John Wesley;
-   and John Wesley's Explanatory Notes on the New Testament.

These Doctrinal Standards are constitutionally protected and nearly
impossible to change or remove.

The basic beliefs of the United Methodist Church include:

-   Triune God. God is one God in three persons: Father, Son and
    Holy Spirit.
-   Scripture. The writings in the Old Testament and New Testament
    are the inspired word of God.
-   Sacraments. The UMC recognizes two sacraments: Baptism and Holy
    Communion. The Church generally practices infant baptism and
    recognizes baptisms from other denominations, and also practices
    open communion.
-   Free will. The UMC is generally
    [Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism") in its soteriology. It
    believes that people, while corrupted by sin, may freely choose or
    reject Christ/salvation because of God's
    [universal prevenient grace](Universal_prevenient_grace "Universal prevenient grace").
