**Universal (or unlimited) atonement** is the view that Christ's
work makes redemption possible for all but certain for none.
According to this doctrine, whatever Christ accomplished on the
cross, he accomplished for all alike â€“ those who are finally saved
as well as those who are finally lost. This view is contrasted to
the Reformed doctrine of
[limited (or definite) atonement](Definite_atonement "Definite atonement").

This view of the atonement is advocated by
[Arminian](Arminianism "Arminianism")/[Methodist](Methodism "Methodism"),
[Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran"), and
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") theologians
(among others). Though Lutherans and Catholics share a similar
doctrine of the nature of the atonement with Reformed theology
(that being vicarious substitution), they differ on its extent,
whereas Arminians and Methodists generally accept an alternate
theory of the nature of the atonement such as the
[moral government theory](Governmental_theory_of_atonement "Governmental theory of atonement").
In either case, the elect in such models are those who choose to
avail themselves of God's gracious offer of salvation in Christ by
their own [free will](Free_will "Free will"), not a
[pre-determined](Predestination "Predestination") group. Thus,
these systems place a limit on the "efficacy" of the atonement
rather than on its extent, as do Calvinists.

This doctrine should not be confused with
[Universalism](Universalism "Universalism") which maintains that
all mankind will be saved.

Historically, the Arminian Remonstrants raised this doctrine of
"universal atonement" as a point of debate against the
predestinarian view of the
[Belgic Confession](Belgic_Confession "Belgic Confession"), which
in turn led to the [Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort")
(1618-1619) where the doctrine was rejected. Nevertheless, this
doctrine of the universal extent of the atonement became and
remains prevalent outside of Calvinistic circles. Even some
Calvinistic Christians, identifying themselves as
[Amyraldians](Amyraldism "Amyraldism") or "four point Calvinists,"
hold to an unlimited atonement. In particular, Amyraldism teaches
that God has provided Christ's atonement for "all alike," but
seeing that none would believe on their own, he then elects those
whom he will bring to faith in Christ, thereby preserving the
Calvinist doctrine of "unconditional"
[election](Election "Election").
