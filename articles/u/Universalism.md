**Universalism** is the theological view arguing that all persons
will ultimately be "saved". Some also teach that there is no such
thing as a literal [hell](Hell "Hell") or eternal punishment.
Universalism has been asserted at various times in different
contexts throughout the
[history of the Christian church](Church_history "Church history").

## Background

"Belief in universal salvation is at least as old as Christianity
itself and may be associated with early Gnostic teachers. The first
clearly universalist writings, however, date from the Greek church
fathers, most notably
[Clement of Alexandria](Clement_of_Alexandria "Clement of Alexandria"),
his student [Origen](Origen "Origen"), and Gregory of Nyssa. Of
these, the teachings of Origen, who believed that even the devil
might eventually be saved, were the most influential. Numerous
supporters of final salvation were to be found in the postapostolic
church, although it was strongly opposed by
[Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") of Hippo. Origen's theology was
at length declared heretical at the fifth ecumenical council in
553."^[[1]](#note-0)^

## Unitarian Universalism

"As an organized religious movement, universalism dates from the
late 1700s in America, where its early leaders were Hosea Ballou,
John Murray, and Elhanan Winchester. As a form of religious
liberalism, it has had close contacts with Unitarianism throughout
its history. The Universalist Church of America and the American
Unitarian Association merged in 1961 to form a single denomination
- the Unitarian Universalist Association."^[[2]](#note-1)^

Unitarians, denying the [Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"), stressed the
unity of God and nature, the humanity of Jesus, and the inherent
goodness in humanity. Universalists, by comparison, agreed with the
humanity of Jesus but had a strong focus on the concept of
universal salvation, and a benevolent God who offers hope to all.
Both of these approaches, merged in Unitarian Universalism, are in
direct opposition to the [trinitarian](Trinity "Trinity") nature of
God and the doctrine of
[original sin](Original_Sin "Original Sin").

## Universal reconciliation

"Universal reconciliation" is the position that all of mankind will
ultimately be saved through Christ whether or not faith is
professed in him in this life. While most proponents may adhere to
many tenets of traditional Christianity, they uniformly claim that
God's qualities of love, goodness, and sovereignty require that all
people will ultimately be saved and that eternal punishment is a
false doctrine. Salvation is not from hell, but from sin. Advocates
of this view take verses such as 1 Timothy 2:6 and 1 John 2:2
literally, explaining that Christ took away sins of the "whole"
world such that there remains no basis for condemnation. This is
also based on the belief that a loving God would not submit any
person, regardless of their sins, to everlasting torment, but would
instead reform them. This is a belief held by some protestant
denominations. An extension of this, called "strong universalism",
holds that no person, even the greatest sinner, is sent to Hell,
and therefore Hell does not need to exist.

Some proponents do believe that there is a physical, literal Hell
in existence, but that Hell is only for the reformation of the
sinners. Hell, though real, "will be remedial and corrective rather
than just punishment for punishment's sake."^[[3]](#note-2)^
