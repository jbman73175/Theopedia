The **Vineyard Movement**, now properly represented by the
Association of Vineyard Churches, is a Christian organization of
over 1600 churches worldwide (approximately 600 in the U.S.). Due
to its size it is often considered to be a Christian denomination,
however church leaders and most laity do not typically consider it
such. Rather it is considered an affiliation of like minded
independent churches.

The Vineyard Movement has been seen as part of a
[Third Wave](Third_Wave "Third Wave") of the Holy Spirit relating
it to the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. However, instead
of the [Charismatic](Charismatic "Charismatic") label, Vineyard
leaders and members have preferred the term
*Empowered Evangelicals* -- a term coined by Rich Nathan and Ken
Wilson in their book of the same name -- to reflect their roots in
traditional [Evangelicalism](Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism"), as
opposed to historic [Pentecostalism](Pentecostal "Pentecostal").

Members also sometimes describe themselves as the "radical middle"
between Evangelicals and Pentecostals, which is a reference to the
book *The Quest for the Radical Middle,* a historical survey of the
Vineyard by Bill Jackson.

John Wimber is often considered the leading founder of the
movement, although the first Vineyard churches existed as an
association of Calvary Chapel churches before his church in Yorba
Linda joined the movement.
