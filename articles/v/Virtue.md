**Virtue:** refers to faith, hope, and love (theological virtues),
as well as prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance (cardinal
virtues). Virtue is an overflow of grace; a response to grace and a
participation in the life of grace. The three theological
virtues--faith, hope, and love--are infused into the soul upon
baptism and are considered to be a unique participation in the life
of the Trinity. The theological virtues are pure gift, infused
within the soul upon baptism. The four cardinal virtues--prudence,
justice, fortitude, and temperance--are habits established through
practice. While wholly insufficient for salvation when left to
themselves, the four cardinal virtues are signs of a mature
Christian life.
