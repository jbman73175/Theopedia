The **Vulgate** Bible is an early 5th century translation of the
[Bible](Bible "Bible") into Latin made by [Jerome](Jerome "Jerome")
on the orders of Pope Damasus I. It takes its name from the phrase
versio vulgata, "the common (i.e., popular) version", and was
written in an everyday Latin used in conscious distinction to the
elegant Ciceronian Latin of which Jerome was a master. The Vulgate
was designed to be both more accurate and easier to understand than
its predecessors. It was the first, and for many centuries the
only, Christian Bible translation that translated the
[Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") directly from the
Hebrew original rather than indirectly from the Greek
[Septuagint](Septuagint "Septuagint").
