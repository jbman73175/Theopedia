W. H. Griffith Thomas
**William Henry Griffith Thomas** (1861-1924), born in Owestry,
Shropshire, England, was an [Anglican](Anglican "Anglican")
clergyman and scholar. He received his B.A. from Kingâ€™s College,
London and his D.D. from Oxford (1895).

Following pastorates in London, Griffith Thomas moved his family to
Toronto Canada in 1910 where he joined the faculty of Wycliffe
College and taught Old Testament literature and exegesis. In 1919,
the family moved to Philadelphia, and there Griffith Thomas carried
on an extensive conference and writing ministry in North America,
Britain, and elsewhere. He authored several books including a
systematic theology entitled *The Principles of Theology* based on
the 39 Articles of the Anglican Communion. Theologically
conservative, Griffith Thomas was both
[Calvinistic](Calvinism "Calvinism") in his soteriology and
[premillennial](Premillennialism "Premillennialism") in his
eschatology.

Having befriended
[Lewis Sperry Chafer](Lewis_Sperry_Chafer "Lewis Sperry Chafer") in
Philadelphia, the two eventually co-founded the Evangelical
Theological College (now Dallas Theological Seminary) in 1924, the
year he died.
