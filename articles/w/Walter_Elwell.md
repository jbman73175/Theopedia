Walter Elwell
**Walter A. Elwell**, born 1937 in Florida, is an evangelical
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian") and noted editor of several
evangelical standard reference works. He is professor emeritus of
Bible and Theology at Wheaton College where he taught from 1975 to
2003.

Elwell earned his B.A. and M.A. from Wheaton College. He then
attended the University of Chicago and University of Tubingen
before earning his Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh. He has
been a consultant to both the Evangelical Christian Publishers
Association and the Evangelical Book Club, and a member of the
Society of Biblical Literature, Institute for Biblical Research,
[Evangelical Theological Society](Evangelical_Theological_Society "Evangelical Theological Society"),
and Chicago Society of Biblical Research.

Elwell has sought to make the results of technical research
available to laypeople, combining rigorous scholarship, readable
style, and pedagogical soundness to meet a desperate need in
todayâ€™s church.

In the introduction to the
*Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology*, he points out that
"In these increasingly post-Christian and post-modern days there is
a virtual illiteracy not only about the historical or factual
content of the [Bible](Bible "Bible") but also about what the Bible
teaches theologically."
