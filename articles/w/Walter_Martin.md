[Evangelical](Evangelical "Evangelical") Christian apologist who
founded the
[Christian Research Institute](Christian_Research_Institute "Christian Research Institute")
in 1960 as a para-church ministry specialising as a clearing-house

## Family

Martin was born in New York City, the son of George Washington
Martin (a judge) and Maud Ainsworth. He was raised in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, and was one of six children.
In the mid 1940s he attended Stony Brook School where he obtained
his high school diploma. At age seventeen he eloped with Patricia
Alice Toner, with the marriage lasting about four years. In June
1952 Martin married Elaine Lois Jacobsen, and this marriage ended
in July 1973. There were five children born out of this union. In
November 1973 Martin married Darlene Nesland, and one daughter was
born. Darlene Nesland remained his wife until Martin's death in
1989.

## Education

Martin's tertiary education began with his brief enrollment at
Adelphi University (September 1946-January 1947), followed by
attendance at Washington Bible College in 1948. Martin finally
settled on taking a degree at Shelton College where he was enrolled
from 1949 until graduation with a B.A. in 1951. He further obtained
a Bachelor of Religious Education degree in 1952 from Shelton
College. One of his best known lecturers at Shelton College was
James Oliver Buswell. In 1956 he received a Master of Arts degree
by coursework in religious education at New York University. Martin
then proceeded as a candidate for the Doctor of Education degree at
New York University but did not fulfil all the requisite work to be
awarded the degree. He subsequently obtained a Ph.D. in 1976 from
California Coast University (formerly known as California Western
University).

## Career

### Early years

Martin's career as an apologist coincided with his tertiary
education in 1949 as he reputedly self-published some pamphlets on
cults. He also practiced answering a variety of questions about the
Bible and faith during lunch hours at a public park situated near
Wall Street, in New York City. Martin has indicated in various book
dedications and in audio recorded lectures how he was mentored by
Frank Gaebelein (Principal, Stony Brook School), Wilbur Smith
(author of the apologetic text *Therefore Stand*), and the
Presbyterian radio evangelist Donald Grey Barnhouse (1895-1960).

Martin's relationship with Barnhouse proved strategic as he was
appointed as a regular columnist to *Eternity* magazine (1955-60).
Barnhouse's support for Martin validated his early ministry in much
of the American Evangelical world. He also worked for a time as a
research associate for the
[National Association of Evangelicals](National_Association_of_Evangelicals "National Association of Evangelicals").

Martin was ordained as a minister of the
[Regular Baptists](index.php?title=Regular_Baptists&action=edit&redlink=1 "Regular Baptists (page does not exist)")
in 1951, but this was revoked in 1953 owing to his remarriage. His
status as a minister has been the subject of much controversy (see
below "Controversies"). While doubts have been raised over his
ordination, what is clear is that Martin did serve as a pastor in
various churches in New York and New Jersey in the 1950s and 1960s.
He also became a regular presenter of Bible study classes convened
by Barnhouse in New York City. In later years Martin would serve as
a preacher and Bible study leader at Melodyland Christian Center
and then at Newport Mesa Christian Center in California.

### Evangelical-Adventist controversy

Perhaps the greatest public controversy of his early career arose
from his studies of
[Seventh-day Adventist](index.php?title=Seventh-day_Adventist&action=edit&redlink=1 "Seventh-day Adventist (page does not exist)")
theology. From its earliest days until the 1950s, the Seventh-day
Adventist church was regarded by Evangelicals and mainstream
Protestants as either an extreme sect or heretical cult. Martin had
initially accepted the received Protestant opinion about the
heretical status of the Seventh-day Adventists. He indicated his
opposition to Adventist teachings in a brief paragraph in the
inaugural edition of his book *The Rise of the Cults*, published in
1955.

However, he reversed his views after a series of interviews with
various leaders of the Seventh-day Adventist church, and on reading
Adventist literature. Martin reported his initial findings to
Barnhouse, and between 1955-56 a series of small conferences were
held with Barnhouse and Martin meeting Adventist leaders like T. E.
Unruh and LeRoy Froom. Barnhouse and Martin then published some of
their findings in a series of articles that appeared in *Eternity*
between September and November 1956. The standpoint taken by
Barnhouse and Martin was that Adventists were largely orthodox on
central doctrines, but heterodox on lesser doctrines, and so could
be classified as belonging in the Evangelical camp. Martin later
expanded his position in a book length treatment in 1960 in
*The Truth About Seventh-day Adventism*.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s Evangelical opinions were divided
over the Martin-Barnhouse stance on the Adventists. Some, like E.
Schuyler English, supported Martin, some such as John Gerstner
urged a sober and fair hearing, while others, such as Louis Talbot,
J. K. van Baalen, Harold Lindsell and Anthony Hoekema, opposed his
view.

### Early writings

Between 1955-65 Martin enjoyed a relationship with Zondervan
publishers where he was appointed as director of cult apologetics
publications. During this period Zondervan released several
publications about cults under his direction, with at least eight
books and four booklets written by Martin. His earliest countercult
books included *Jehovah of the Watchtower*,
*The Christian Science Myth*, *The Christian and the Cults* and
*The Maze of Mormonism*.

Martin's primary approach to assessing cults was to focus on
doctrinal issues, particularly those concerning the person, nature
and work of Christ. Martin emphasised contrasting Biblical
teachings with those of the cults, and for many evangelicals he
standardised the dominant style of countercult apologetics by
refuting heresy.

### Christian Research Institute

In 1960 Martin established the Christian Research Institute in New
Jersey, and then in 1974 relocated it to Southern California. In
its earliest years Martin's colleagues who were associated with
Christian Research Institute included Walter Bjorck, James
Bjornstad, Floyd Hamilton, and Shildes Johnson, many of whom went
on to publish countercult books.

Through this para-church organisation Martin built up a reference
library of primary sources, sought to train Christians in the art
of apologetics and evangelism, developed a bureau of speakers, and
from the early 1960s conceived of the need for a computerised data
base of apologetic information. Martin's prescient advocacy of
using computer technology for apologetic purposes led to a major
conference, the All-Europe Conference on Computer Technique for
Theological Research held in Austria in September 1968. This became
the subject of the book
*Computers, Cultural Change and the Christ*, which was written by
Martin's friend and colleague John Warwick Montgomery.

In 1978 he established a ministry periodical known as *Forward*,
which was redesigned in 1987 as *Christian Research Journal*.
Martin mentored several figures who have become prominent
apologists in the
[Christian countercult movement](index.php?title=Christian_countercult_movement&action=edit&redlink=1 "Christian countercult movement (page does not exist)")
including Bob and Gretchen Passantino, Elliot Miller, John Weldon,
Ron Rhodes, Rich Poll, Paul Carden, and Robert Bowman. Many of the
people who have established ministries in the Christian countercult
movement regard Martin as the grandfather figure of this form of
apologetics. One indicator of the high esteem in which he was held
is that at least twelve books have been dedicated to him.

## Controversies

Martin was a figure of controversy who aroused great loyalty among
his colleagues, and deep animosity from many of his detractors. He
was criticised by some ultra-fundamentalist Protestants for his
affiliations with Pentecostals and Charismatics, and for his
refusal to classify the Roman Catholic church as a cult. He was the
subject of scathing criticism of his doctrinal stance by the
Canadian historian and ex-Jehovah's Witness M. James Penton. He was
also criticized by Thomas Johnsen for defending the Lieber
manuscript as an authentic source document for Mary Baker Eddy's
Christian Science.

In the 1980s Martin was involved in critical debates over the
positive confession success theology (also called
[Word Faith](index.php?title=Word_Faith&action=edit&redlink=1 "Word Faith (page does not exist)"))
of Christian charismatic teachers such as
[Kenneth Copeland](index.php?title=Kenneth_Copeland&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kenneth Copeland (page does not exist)")
and [Kenneth Hagin](Kenneth_Hagin "Kenneth Hagin"). While Martin
was critical of these teachers' claims concerning their views of
Christ, healing, faith, and prosperity, he nonetheless was
persuaded of the perpetuity of charismatic spiritual gifts in the
Church. To that end Martin presented his positive appraisal of
spiritual gifts in several audio lectures, and by editing with
chapter end-notes, a fresh reprint edition of D. L. Moody's book
*Secret Power*.

He was involved in several public confrontations with Mormon
leaders and apologists, one of which involved contesting the
content of Martin's lectures and credentials in a Californian
law-suit in the mid 1970s. Another concerned contested claims about
the origins of the
[Book of Mormon](Book_of_Mormon "Book of Mormon"). During the 1980s
his tertiary credentials and ordination status as a
[Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") minister had further doubts cast on
them by popular Mormon apologists Robert and Rosemary Brown. They
compiled a multi-volume work *They Lie In Wait To Deceive*, of
which the third volume involved a critical attack on Martin's
credentials and claims about the
[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints").
Since his death Martin's daughter, Jill Martin Rische has sought to
answer some of these allegations via the website she
co-administers, Walter Martin's Religious Information Network. She
has documented her father's ministerial status as a recognized
pastor within the Directory of the Californian Southern Baptist
Convention.

After his death a controversy ensued about the leadership
succession to Christian Research Institute. This controversy was
between Martin's widow and several of his children on one side, and
[Hank Hanegraaff](Hank_Hanegraaff "Hank Hanegraaff"), along with
other members of Martin’s family on the other. Hanegraaff succeeded
to the ministry's presidency on June 29, 1989. The controversy
remains unresolved as Hanegraaff continues to direct the ministry.
In November 2009, new evidence became available that sheds light on
this controversy. Audio tapes from Walter Martin’s bible class at
Newport Mesa Christian Center reveal that Martin had spent
considerable time investigating Hanegraaff’s background and was
very familiar with his work. On a tape dated December 7, 1986,
Martin tells his class that he has been promoting Hanegraaff’s
*Memory Dynamics* for more than 5 years. On October 23, 1988,
Martin tells his class that he has been praying for one man, for
two years, to come to CRI as an Executive Vice President. On
December 4, 1988, Martin introduces Hanegraaff to his bible class,
as CRI’s Executive Vice President. These audio clips can be heard
be heard along with additional material at Walter Martin Jude 3
(waltermartinjude3.com), the website established by Cindee Martin
Morgan, another of Walter Martin’s daughters, and her husband Rick
Morgan.

Rick Morgan and Cindee Martin Morgan created Walter Martin Jude 3
to help shed light on the ongoing controversy surrounding Hank
Hanegraaff and his position at CRI. Hearing Dr. Martin in his own
words allows interested persons to consider critical additional
information, while developing an informed opinion in these
matters.

Jill Martin Rische has sought to perpetuate her father's ministry
through Walter Martin's Religious Information Network, and by
arranging for the publication in 2003 of a fresh posthumous edition
of *The Kingdom of the Cults*. She also collated and transcribed
excerpts from around one hundred of her father's sermons and
bible-study talks, which was released in 1999 as
*Through the Windows of Heaven*.
