## Defining systematic theology

Wayne Grudem defines systematic theology as "any study that answers
the question, 'What does the whole Bible teach us today?' about any
given topic." ^[[1]](#note-0)^ In summary, then, systematic
theology involves,

1.  "find all the relevant verses" by using a "good concordance"
2.  "read, make notes on, and try and summarize the points made in
    the relevant verses"
3.  "the relevant verses should be summarized into one or more
    points that the Bible affirms about the subject" ^[[2]](#note-1)^

While some may find Grudem's definition to be over-simplistic, his
motivation is to provide a model that makes it "possible for any
Christian who can read his or her Bible [to] look up the words in a
concordance" and thus learn to do systematic theology at a basic
level. ^[[3]](#note-2)^

## Quotes

### Understanding the Bible

-   "I am surprised, and thankful to God for the way the book
    (Systematic Theology) seems to continue to be a blessing to people
    – and not just to pastors and seminary students, but lots of other
    Christians from all walks of life. As you know, I believe that God
    intended His Word to be understood, not just by specialists, but
    also by ordinary Christians." ^[[4]](#note-3)^

### Women in ministry

-   "I don’t think a pastor can give a woman “permission” to do
    Bible teaching before the church, because the Bible says not to do
    that. Would we say a pastor, or a board of elders, could give a
    woman “permission” to violate the command, “You should not steal”,
    or to violate any other command of Scripture? No pastor or elder
    board has authority to give permission to anyone to disobey the
    Bible. It’s God’s Word and we need to obey it." ^[[5]](#note-4)^

### Church structure and authority

-   ". . . it is always wise to have a governing structure where
    the highest governing offices in the church and the highest
    positions of influence are open to lay people as well as ordained
    people. The denominations where only clergy have the highest of
    authority seem to be the ones that are never able to be brought
    back once they drift into liberalism because the ordinary lay
    people who have common sense and are reading their Bibles every day
    don’t have any way to regain control of a denomination that has
    gone astray if it has that kind of structure." ^[[6]](#note-5)^
