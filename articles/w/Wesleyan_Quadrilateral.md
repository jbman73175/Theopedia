[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley") used four different
sources in coming to theological conclusions. These sources were
first referred to as the **Wesleyan Quadrilateral** in 1964 by
theologian/scholar
[Albert C. Outler](Albert_C._Outler "Albert C. Outler") in a
collection of Wesley's works edited by Outler entitled simply
*John Wesley*. The four sources are:

1.  Scripture
2.  Tradition
3.  Reason
4.  Experience

## Methodology

**Scripture** refers to the inspired and sufficient written word of
God, the 66 canonical books of the Bible. Upon this foundation
church **traditions** are adopted which agree with the biblical
text, and those which are inconsistent are discarded. Next,
**reason** is received as a gift intrinsic to the image of God.
Finally, with Scripture, tradition and reason in place, human
beings are prepared to **experience** the reality of God's love.

## Caution

It is interesting to note the reflection of Albert Outler on his
formulation, "There is one phrase I wish I had never used: the
*Wesleyan Quadrilateral*. It has created the wrong image in the
minds of so many people and, I am sure, will lead to all kinds of
controversy."
[[1]](http://www.goodnewsmag.org/magazine/1JanFeb/jf05Quadrilateral.htm)

The problems he anticipated come when the Quadrilateral is seen as
"equilateral," and all four "sources" for authority and
decision-making are seen as equally weighted. This was not Outler's
intent nor Wesley's method. Rather, Scripture is to be viewed as
the centerpiece from which the other sources are suspended.

However, misuse of the methodology is already manifest in many
quarters on many issues:

-   It has been used to endorse same sex marriage in
    [The Bible and Homosexuality](http://www.divinepeacemcc.org/Links/homosexuality%20and%20the%20bible.pdf)
    and [Same Sex Marriage](http://www.worship.ca/docs/ww_70.html)
    where the latter says, "As I understand this Quadrilateral,
    Christians have four sources in any search for standards in making
    decisions: 1) The Bible; 2) Tradition, including but not limited to
    the tradition of the Church; 3) Reason, by which is meant science
    and the best of human rationality applied to the problem; and 4)
    Personal experience." He then states that "The Bible gives us
    almost no direct guidance in the issue of same-sex marriage," and
    proceeds to justify it on the basis of reason and experience.

-   It has been used to endorse the role of women elders and
    pastors in
    [Changing Female Religious Leadership in Christianity](http://www.cismor.jp/en/research/report/takahashi.pdf)
    where it is stated that, "The Methodist Quadrilateral uses reason
    or rationally critical perspective when it thinks about the
    Scripture and the traditions. . . . In many cases female leadership
    has been restricted by biblical and cultural restrictions. But the
    authority of experience has transformed the gender boundaries of
    religious leadership through American Methodist history."

These examples are not intended to judge the particular conclusions
but merely to evidence the arrival at theological judgments which
essentially eliminate Scripture as relevent.
