**Wesleyan perfectionism**, sometimes called
**entire sanctification**, is a view held by
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley") that taught that
Christians could to some degree attain perfection in this life.
Wesley described it as,

"...that habitual disposition of the soul which, in the sacred
writings, is termed holiness; and which directly implies being
cleansed from sin, 'from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit';
and, by consequence, being endued with those virtues which were in
Christ Jesus; being so 'renewed in the image of our mind,' as to be
'perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect'
(*A Plain Account of Christian Perfectionism*, p. 12).
Furthermore,

"In this is perfection, and glory, and happiness: the royal law of
heaven and earth is this, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
all they heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and
with all thy strength.' The one perfect good shall be your one
ultimate end" ([ibid.](Ibid. "Ibid.")).
Lastly, perfection is "deliverance from inward as well as from
outward sin" (ibid., p. 26) and "a Christian is so far perfect as
not to commit sin" (ibid., p. 25).

## How one attains perfection

Wesley says that perfection is "spoken of as receivable by mere
faith, and as hindered only by unbelief." Moreover, "this faith,
and consequently the salvation which it brings, is spoken of as a
given in an instant... It is supposed that instant may be now"
(ibid., p. 34).

## What perfection is not

Wesley was clear what perfection *doesn't* mean,

"They are not perfect knowledge. They are not free from ignorance,
no, nor from mistake. We are no more to expect any living man to be
infallible, than to be omniscient. They are not free from
infirmities, such as weakness or slowness of understanding,
irregular quickness or heaviness of imagination... (ibid., p. 23).
He later clarified that,

"We willingly allow and continually declare, there is no such
perfection in this life, as implies either a dispensation from
doing good, and attending all ordinances of God, or a freedom from
ignorance, mistake, temptation, and a thousand infirmities
necessarily connected with flesh and blood (ibid., p. 35).
## Important Issues

### Sin

Sin is that which is contrary to the nature and character of God.
The word *sin*, as understood by Wesley, refers to:

1.  ...thoughts, intentions, and acts contrary to God, wherein the
    offender is a sentient, morally accountable being (e.g. angels,
    human beings/mankind-the children of Adam).
2.  ...the nature posessed by *fallen* beings. This nature, also
    called *the flesh* is a product of *the fall* and is imputed to the
    children of Adam - every man, woman, and child. It is a nature with
    which we are born and is present in every descendant of Adam and
    Eve, except the virgin born Jesus Christ. The flesh is at war with
    God's Spirit, compelling men and women to do that which is contrary
    God.
3.  ...an oblation (i.e. a sacrifice offering). The Old Testament
    animal sacrifices represent the one ultimate sin offering of the
    Messiah. Customarily, in recognition of the sin nature with which
    every man is born, and in recognition of personal, individual sins,
    the transgressor would put his hands of the head of the offering.
    This was a solemn moment, in which the offerer of the oblation
    acknowledged that an innocent victim was to suffer and shed its
    blood for the sinner. Laying the hands on the head represented the
    sin being transfered to the sacrifice, so that the oblation would
    die for the sin comitted. This was ultimately fulfilled in the Lamb
    of God, Jesus. Thus, because of the identification with the sin of
    the transgressor, and the oblation, the offering became known of
    as, :sin." "He who knew no sin was made sin for us, that we might
    be made the righteousness of God.

One of the Hebrew words translated *sin* means, "to miss the mark."
This sort of sin can be typified by the archer who misses the
bullseye. There could be various reasons why he misses the mark. He
could be out of practice, or his aim could be off, for example.
Hitting the mark is analogous to doing that which is right. Thus,
when we don't put out enough effort to be obedient to God (out of
practice), or when our focus is on something other than God's will
(misdirected aim), we are liable to miss the mark.

There are also sins of rebellion (blatant defiance of God), and
sins of omission, in which we neglect to do that which is right.

Sin and death have been conquered by the LORD.

### Perfection

Scripture is clear that perfection is commanded of us (see passages
below), however, it is important to understand what this really
means. The [Greek](Greek "Greek") word *teleioi*, found in Matthew
5:48, does not mean "flawless" or "spotless". Rather, it means
"complete". It becomes possible, then, to be "perfect" without
being entirely free from sin. "That is, we can possess the fullness
of Jesus Christ (Eph. 4:13) and the full fruit of the Spirit (Gal.
5:22-23) without possessing them completely" (Erickson, p. 985).

## Objections

Wesley dealt with objections to the doctrine in several sermons and
letters, and most notably in a brief treatise entitled
[A Plain Account of Christian Perfection](http://gbgm-umc.org/Umhistory/Wesley/perfect.html).
Many Christians, particularly those adhering to some form of
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism"), have objected to the doctrine,
seeing contradictions between Wesleyan thought and Scripture
passages such as James 3:2, 1 John 1:8, and Ecclesiastes 7:20.

Today this view is held by some churches in the Nazarene, Church of
God, and Pentecostal Holiness Church denominations.

## Other quotes

"...Wesley’s doctrine of perfection, as he and his brother Charles
set it forth in homiletic prose and ecstatic hymns respectively,
gave the Wesleyan version of the Christian life a quality of ardor,
exuberance, and joy—-joy in knowing God’s love, and praising his
grace, and resigning oneself into his hands—that went beyond
anything we find in Calvin, the Puritans, and the earlier
Pietists," (Packer, p. 134).
