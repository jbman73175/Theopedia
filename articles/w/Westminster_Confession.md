**The Westminster Confession of Faith** is a
[Reformed](Reformed "Reformed") confession of faith in the
Calvinist theological tradition. Although drawn up by the 1646
Westminster Assembly, largely of the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England"), it
became the 'subordinate standard' of doctrine in the Church of
Scotland and has been influential within
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") churches worldwide.
With selected changes it has also been adopted by some
Congregationalists and was the basis for the
[1689 London Baptist Confession](1689_London_Baptist_Confession "1689 London Baptist Confession").

## Historical Context

## The 1789 American Revision

The revisions of 1787-1789 removed certain powers of the civil
government over the church, which might be called theocratic
principles, from the Westminster Confession of faith and
catechisms. It also removes explicit identification of the Pope as
the Antichrist.

## Westminster Standards

The Westminster Standards are the Westminster Confession of Faith,
the Westminster Shorter Catechism, the Westminster Larger
Catechism, the Directory of Public Worship, and the Form of Church
Government referred to collectively.
