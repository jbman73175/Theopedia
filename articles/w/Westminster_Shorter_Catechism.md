The **Westminster Shorter Catechism** (also known simply as the
**Shorter Catechism**) was written in the 1640s by English and
Scottish clergymen -- the assembly that also produced the
[Westminster Confession of Faith](Westminster_Confession_of_Faith "Westminster Confession of Faith")
and the
[Westminster Larger Catechism](index.php?title=Westminster_Larger_Catechism&action=edit&redlink=1 "Westminster Larger Catechism (page does not exist)").
The three documents together are often referred to as the
Westminster Standards and are judged by some as the most important
English documents coming out of the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation").

The Shorter Catechism is designed to educate lay persons in matters
of [doctrine](Doctrine "Doctrine") and belief and, as with other
catechisms, is in a simple question and answer format to facilitate
memorization.

Perhaps the most famous of the questions is the first:

Q. 1. What is the chief end of man?   
A. Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.
