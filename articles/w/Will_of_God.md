There are three meanings of the will of God
[[1]](http://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/onsite/wills_sproul.html):

1.  **Sovereign decretive will** is the will by which God brings to
    pass whatsoever He decrees. This is hidden to us until it happens.
2.  **Preceptive will** is God's revealed law or commandments,
    which we have the power but not the right to break.
3.  **Will of disposition** describes God's attitude or
    disposition. It reveals what is pleasing to Him.
