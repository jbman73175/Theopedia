William Ames
**William Ames** (1576-1633), English [Puritan](Puritan "Puritan")
theologian remembered for his writings on ethics and for debating
and writing in favour of strict [Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism")
in opposition to [Arminianism](Arminianism "Arminianism").

As a student at Cambridge, Ames viewed cardplaying as an offense to
Christian living—no less serious than profanity. In 1609 his
dispute with the Church of England's customs of conduct came to a
head in his sermon attacking what he saw as the debauchery
attending the feast of St. Thomas. Obliged to leave England, he
sailed in 1610 to Rotterdam. There, in the fisherman's habit donned
for the passage, he debated Nicolaas Grevinckhoven (Grevinchovius),
minister to the local Arminian Church, on the doctrines of
[atonement](Atonement "Atonement") and
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination").

Ames, considered triumphant in the debates, became widely known
throughout the Low Countries. Subsequently, he entered into written
disputes with Grevinckhoven on
[universal redemption](Universal_atonement "Universal atonement")
and related questions. He served as an observer at the
[Synod of Dort](Synod_of_Dort "Synod of Dort") (1618-19), at which
Arminianism was firmly denounced, and as professor of theology at
Franeker, in Friesland (1622-33). Among his more important works
are *Medulla Theologiae* (1623; *The Marrow of Sacred Divinity*,
1642) and *De Conscientia et Ejus Jure vel Casibus* (1632;
*Conscience*, 1639). The latter text was considered for many years
by the Dutch Reformed Church to be a standard treatise on Christian
ethics and the variety of ethical situations faced by believers.
