William Carey
**William Carey** (August 17, 1761 - June 9, 1834) was an English
missionary and [Baptist](Baptist "Baptist") minister, known as the
"father of modern missions." Carey was one of the founders of the
Baptist Missionary Society. As a missionary in Serampore, India, he
translated the [Bible](Bible "Bible") into Bengali, Sanskrit, and
numerous other languages and dialects.

## Childhood and early adulthood

Carey, the eldest of five children, was born to Edmund and
Elizabeth Carey, who were weavers by trade in the village of
Paulerspury in Northampton. William was raised in the
[Church of England](Church_of_England "Church of England"); when he
was six, his father was appointed the parish clerk and village
schoolmaster. As a child he was naturally inquisitive and keenly
interested in the natural sciences, particularly botany. He
possessed a natural gift for language, teaching himself Latin.

At the age of 16, Carey’s father apprenticed him to a shoemaker in
the nearby village of Hackleton. His master, Clarke Nichols, was a
churchman like himself, but another apprentice, John Warr, was a
[Dissenter](index.php?title=Dissenter&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dissenter (page does not exist)").
Through his influence Carey would eventually leave the Church of
England and join with other Dissenters to form a small
[Congregational](Congregationalism "Congregationalism") church in
Hackleton. While apprenticed to Nichols, he also taught himself
[Greek](Greek "Greek") with the help of a local villager who had a
college education.

When Nichols died in 1779, Carey went to work for another local
shoemaker, Thomas Old; he married Old’s sister-in-law Dorothy
Plackett in 1781. Unlike William, Dorothy was illiterate; her
signature in the marriage register is a crude cross. William and
Dorothy Carey had six children, four sons and two daughters; both
girls died in infancy. Olds himself died soon afterward, and Carey
took over his business, during which time he taught himself
[Hebrew](Hebrew "Hebrew"), Italian, Dutch, and French, often
reading while working on his shoes.

## Founding of the Baptist Missionary Society

Carey became involved with a local association of Particular
Baptists that had recently formed, where he became acquainted with
men such as John Ryland, John Sutcliff, and Andrew Fuller, who
would become his close friends in later years. They invited him to
preach in their church in the nearby village of Barton every other
Sunday. On October 5, 1783, William Carey was
[baptized](Baptism "Baptism") by Ryland and committed himself to
the Baptist denomination.

In 1785, Carey was appointed the schoolmaster for the town of
Moulton. He was also invited to pastor the local Baptist church.
During this time he read
[Jonathan Edwards](Jonathan_Edwards "Jonathan Edwards")'
*Account of the Life of the Late Rev. [David Brainerd](David_Brainerd "David Brainerd")*
and the journals of the explorer James Cook, and became deeply
concerned with propagating the Christian [Gospel](Gospel "Gospel")
throughout the world. His friend Andrew Fuller had previously
written an influential pamphlet in 1781 titled
*The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation*, answering the
[hyper-Calvinist](Hyper-Calvinism "Hyper-Calvinism") belief then
prevalent in the Baptist churches, that all men were not
responsible to believe the Gospel. At a ministers' meeting in 1786,
Carey raised the question of whether it was the duty of all
Christians to spread the Gospel throughout the world. J. R. Ryland,
the father of John Ryland, is said to have retorted: "Young man,
sit down; when God pleases to convert the heathen, he will do it
without your aid or mine."

In 1789 Carey became the full-time pastor of a small Baptist church
in Leicester. Two years later he published his groundbreaking
missionary manifesto,
*An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens*.
This short book consists of five parts. The first part is a
theological justification for missionary activity, arguing that the
command of Jesus to make disciples of all the world (Matthew
28:18-20) remains binding on Christians. The second part outlines a
history of missionary activity, beginning with the early Church and
ending with David Brainerd and
[John Wesley](John_Wesley "John Wesley"). Part 3 comprises 26 pages
of tables, listing area, population, and religion statistics for
every country in the world. Carey had compiled these figures during
his years as a schoolteacher. The fourth part answers objections to
sending missionaries, such as difficulty learning the language or
danger to life. Finally, the fifth part calls for the formation by
the Baptist denomination of a missionary society and describes the
practical means by which it could be supported. Carey's seminal
pamphlet outlines his basis for missions: Christian obligation,
wise use of available resources, and accurate information.

Carey later preached a pro-missionary sermon, using Isaiah 54:2-3
as his text, in which he repeatedly used the epigram which has
become his most famous quotation: "Attempt great things for God;
expect great things from God." Carey finally overcame the
resistance to missionary effort, and the Particular Baptist Society
for Propagating the Gospel among the Heathen (now the Baptist
Missionary Society) was founded in October 1791, including Carey,
Andrew Fuller, John Ryland, and John Sutcliff as charter members.
They then concerned themselves with practical matters such as
raising funds, as well as deciding where they would direct their
efforts. A medical missionary, Dr. John Thomas, had been in
Calcutta and was currently in England raising funds; they agreed to
support him and that Carey would accompany him to India.

## Early Indian period

Carey, his eldest son Felix, Thomas and his wife and daughter
sailed from London aboard an English ship in April 1792. Dorothy
Carey had refused to leave England, being pregnant with their
fourth son and having never been more than a few miles from home.
En route they were delayed at the Isle of Wight, at which time the
captain of the ship received word that he endangered his command if
he conveyed the missionaries to Calcutta, as their unauthorized
journey violated the trade monopoly of the British East India
Company. He decided to sail without them, and they were delayed
until June when Thomas found a Danish captain willing to offer them
passage. In the meantime, Carey's wife, who had by now given birth,
agreed to accompany him provided her sister came as well. They
landed at Calcutta in November.

During the first year in Calcutta, the missionaries sought means to
support themselves and a place to establish their mission. They
also began to learn the Bengali language to communicate with the
natives. A friend of Thomas owned two indigo factories and needed
managers, so Carey moved with his family north to Mudnabatty.
During the six years that Carey managed the indigo plant, he
completed the first revision of his Bengali
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") and began
formulating the principles upon which his missionary community
would be formed, including communal living, financial
self-reliance, and the training of indigenous ministers. His son
Peter died of dysentery, causing Dorothy to suffer a nervous
breakdown from which she never recovered.

Meanwhile, the missionary society had begun sending more
missionaries to India. The first to arrive was John Fountain, who
arrived in Mudnabatty and began teaching school. He was followed by
William Ward, a printer; Joshua Marshman, a schoolteacher; David
Brunsdon, one of Marshman's students; and William Grant, who died
three weeks after his arrival. Because the East India Company was
still hostile to missionaries, they settled in the Danish colony at
Serampore and were joined there by Carey on January 10, 1800.

## Late Indian period

Once settled in Serampore, the mission bought a house large enough
to accommodate all of their families and a school, which was to be
their principal means of support. Ward set up a print shop with a
secondhand press Carey had acquired and began the task of printing
the Bible in Bengali. In August 1800 Fountain died of dystentery.
By the end of that year, the mission had their first convert, a
Hindu named Krishna Pal. They had also earned the goodwill of the
local Danish government and Richard Wellesley, then
Governor-General of India.

The conversion of Hindus to Christianity posed a new question for
the missionaries concerning whether it was appropriate for converts
to retain their caste. In 1802, the daughter of Krishna Pal, a
Sudra, married a Brahmin. This wedding was a public demonstration
that the church repudiated the caste distinctions.

Brunsdon and Thomas died in 1801. The same year, the
Governor-General founded Fort William, a college intended to
educate civil servants. He offered Carey the position of professor
of Bengali. Carey's colleagues at the college included pundits,
whom he could consult to correct his Bengali testament. He also
wrote grammars of Bengali and Sanskrit, and began a translation of
the Bible into Sanskrit. He also used his influence with the
Governor-General to help put a stop to the practices of infant
sacrifice and suttee, after consulting with the pundits and
determining that they had no basis in the Hindu sacred writings
(although the latter would not be abolished until 1829).

Dorothy Carey died in 1807; Carey remarried a year later to
Charlotte Rhumohr, a Danish member of his church who, unlike
Dorothy, was his intellectual equal. They were married for 13 years
until her death.

From the printing press at the mission came translations of the
Bible in Bengali, Sanskrit, and other major languages and dialects.
Many of these languages had never been printed before; William Ward
had to create punches for the type by hand. Carey had begun
translating literature and sacred writings from the original
Sanskrit into English to make them accessible to his own
countryman. On March 11, 1812, a fire in the print shop caused
£10,000 in damages and lost work. Amongst the losses were many
irreplaceable manuscripts, including much of Carey's translation of
Sanskrit literature and a polyglot dictionary of Sanskrit and
related languages, which would have been a seminal philological
work had it been completed. However, the press itself and the
punches were saved, and the mission was able to continue printing
in six months. In Carey's lifetime, the mission printed and
distributed the Bible in whole or part in 44 languages and
dialects.

In 1818, the mission founded Serampore College to train indigenous
ministers for the growing church and to provide education in the
arts and sciences to anyone regardless of caste or country. The
King of Denmark granted a royal charter in 1827 that made the
college a degree-granting institution, the first in Asia.

Carey's second wife, Charlotte, died in 1821, followed by his
eldest son Felix. In 1823 he married a third time, to a widow named
Grace Hughes.

Internal dissent and resentment was growing within the Missionary
Society as its numbers grew, the older missionaries died, and they
were replaced by less experienced men unused to the rigorous work
ethic of Carey, Ward, and Marshman. Andrew Fuller, who had been
secretary of the Society in England, had died in 1815, and his
successor, John Dyer, was a bureaucrat who attempted to reorganize
the Society along business lines and manage every detail of the
Serampore mission from England. Their differences proved to be
irreconcilable, and Carey formally severed ties with the missionary
society he had founded, leaving the mission property and moving
onto the college grounds. He lived a quiet life until his death in
1834, revising his Bengali Bible, preaching, and teaching
students.
