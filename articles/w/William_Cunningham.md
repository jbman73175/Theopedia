William Cunningham
**William Cunningham** (1805-1861) was an eminent Scottish
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian") in the Reformed tradition and
one of the founders of the Free Church of Scotland. Cunningham is
remembered primarily as a defender of
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") and the doctrine of the
[Trinity](Trinity "Trinity"). He is one of the great resources on
the history of the [Reformation](Reformation "Reformation").
Selected Titles include: *Historical Theology*;
*The Principal Doctrinal Discussions in the Christian Church Since the Apostolic Age*;
and *The Reformers and the Theology of the Reformation*.

He studied at Edinburgh, was licensed as a preacher in 1838;
settled as a minister in Greenock in 1830; moved to Trinity College
Church, Edinburgh, in 1834; was appointed professor in the New
College in 1843, and principal (in succession to Dr. Chalmers) in
1847.

In his New College lectures, delivered from 1847 to 1861,
Cunningham surveyed the history of theology training his eye on the
tension between [law](Law "Law") and [grace](Grace "Grace") that
has existed throughout the centuries. The lectures became the basis
of his two-volume *Historical Theology*.
