William Farel
**William Farel** (Guillaume Farel, 1489-1565) was a French
evangelist, and a founder of the [Reformed](Reformed "Reformed")
Church in the cantons of Neuchtel, Berne, Geneva, and the Canton of
Vaud Switzerland. He is most often remembered for having persuaded
[John Calvin](John_Calvin "John Calvin") to remain in Geneva in
1536, and for persuading him to return there in 1541, after their
expulsion in 1538. Together with Calvin, Farel worked to train
missionary preachers who spread the
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant") cause to other countries, and
especially to France.

Farel was a fiery preacher and an energetic critic of the
[Roman Catholic](Roman_Catholic "Roman Catholic") Church. In the
earliest years of the Reformation in France, he was a pupil of the
pro-reform Catholic priest, Jacques Lefevre d'Etaples. While
working with Lefevre in Meaux, he came under the influence of
Lutheran ideas and became an avid promoter of them. He was forced
to flee to Switzerland because of controversy that was aroused by
his writings against the use of images in Christian worship.

Interesting to note that as Calvin's friend, Farel was a promoter
of [Lutheran](Lutheran "Lutheran") ideas in his youth. Today
[Calvinism](Calvinism "Calvinism") and
[Lutheranism](Lutheranism "Lutheranism") are two completely
separate denominations, but Farel's relationship with both would
show they had more in common than what is shown today.
