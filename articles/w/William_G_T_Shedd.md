William G. T. Shedd
**William G. T. Shedd** (1820–1894), one of the eminent theologians
of his era, was a thoroughgoing [Calvinist](Calvinism "Calvinism")
and church historian. As an Old School
[Presbyterian](Presbyterian "Presbyterian") he held fast to the
[Westminster Standards](Westminster_Confession "Westminster Confession").
Shedd appropriated many of the leading intellectual trends of the
nineteenth century without sacrificing his commitment to
[Reformed](Reformed_theology "Reformed theology") orthodoxy.

"His speculative interests in Romanticism, historical consciousness
and evolution made him remarkably sensitive to the powerful new
thinking of his century. Yet Shedd did not create any controversy,
for his firm Calvinist faith was never altered by his novel
speculations." ^[[1]](#note-0)^

"While a student at the University of Vermont, Shedd was profoundly
influenced by his philosophy professor, James Marsh. Thereafter his
thinking reflected an intimate familiarity with the leading
luminaries of European Romanticism. Upon his graduation from
Andover Theological Seminary, Shedd served a Congregational church
in Brandon, Vermont, and later a church in New York City. But his
pastoral labors were brief, less than four years in all. The
greater part of his career was devoted to teaching. His diversified
appointments included seven years as professor of English
literature at Vermont, two years as professor of sacred rhetoric at
Auburn Theological Seminary and eight years as professor of church
history at Andover. In 1863 he accepted a position at Union
Theological Seminary (New York), beginning an affiliation with that
institution which would continue for twenty-eight years. After 1874
he served as professor of systematic theology, succeeding Henry
Boynton Smith." ^[[2]](#note-1)^

As a systematician he was steeped in the patristic, medieval, and
[reformation](Reformation "Reformation") periods and was especially
influenced by [Augustine](Augustine "Augustine") and
[Calvin](Calvin "Calvin"). His crowning work was Dogmatic Theology
(3 vols., 1888-1894). Shedd's writings were direct, logical, and
lucid; for him theology was a science, understood in Baconian
terms, as interpreted by Scottish commonsense realism. His other
well known works include History of Christian Doctrine (1863),
Literary Essays (1878), and Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy (1893).
