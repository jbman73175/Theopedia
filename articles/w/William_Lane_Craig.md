William Lane Craig
**William Lane Craig** is Research Professor of Philosophy at
[Talbot School of Theology](Talbot_School_of_Theology "Talbot School of Theology")
in La Mirada, California.. Craig pursued his undergraduate studies
at [Wheaton College](Wheaton_College "Wheaton College") (B.A. 1971)
and graduate studies at
[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School](Trinity_Evangelical_Divinity_School "Trinity Evangelical Divinity School")
(M.A. 1974; M.A. 1975), the University of Birmingham in England
(Ph.D. 1977), and the University of Munich in Germany (D.Theol.
1984).

From 1980-86 Craig taught
[Philosophy of Religion](Philosophy_of_Religion "Philosophy of Religion")
at Trinity, during which time he and his wife started their family.
In 1987 they moved to Brussels, Belgium, where Craig pursued
research at the University of Louvain until 1994. He is considered
a specialist on the
[Resurrection of Jesus](Resurrection_of_Jesus "Resurrection of Jesus"),
and regularly speaks on the
[existence of God](Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God "Arguments for the existence of God")
and middle knowledge ([Molinism](Molinism "Molinism")).

"Craig has become one of Molinism’s most enthusiastic contemporary
proponents, not only arguing in favor of middle knowledge and
defending the doctrine against its critics, but also applying the
doctrine to a wide range of theological issues, such as divine
[providence](Providence "Providence") and
[predestination](Predestination "Predestination"), biblical
inspiration,
[perseverance of the saints](Perseverance_of_the_saints "Perseverance of the saints"),
and Christian particularism."^[[1]](#note-0)^
