    The Christian in Complete Armour;

A Treatise Of the Saints' War against the Devil:

Wherein a Discovery is made of that grand Enemy of God and his
People, in his Policies, Power, Seat of his Empire, Wickedness, and
chief design he hath against the Saings. A Magazine Opened,

From whence the Christian is furnished with Spiritual Arms for the
Battle, helped on with his Armour, and taught the use of his
Weapon: together with the happy issue of the whole War. ]
