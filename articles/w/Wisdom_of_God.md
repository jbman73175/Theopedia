The **wisdom of God** is sometimes referred to as his
**omnisapience**, just as *omniscience* means all-knowing,
*omnisapience* means all-wise, etc. By his omniscience, God
perfectly knows all possibilities and what would happen if they
came to pass. By his omnisapience, his wisdom is perfect so that he
knows which course of action is the best (Isaiah 55:8-9; Romans
11:33; Ephesians 1:11-12; 3:10). The wisdom of God is the practical
side of God's knowledge, applying knowledge to achieve His desires
in ways that will glorify Him the most.
