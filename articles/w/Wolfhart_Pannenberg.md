Wolfhart Pannenberg
**Wolfhart Pannenberg** (b. 1928) is a German Christian theologian.
Born in Stettin, Germany (which is now Szczecin Poland), Pannenberg
was [baptized at as an infant](Paedo_baptism "Paedo baptism") into
the [Lutheran Church](Lutheran "Lutheran"). Despite his baptism,
Pannenberg had virtually no contact with the
[church](Church "Church") in his early years. Some time in his
youth though, he had an intensely religious experience that he
called his "light experience." Pannenberg wanted to understand this
experience and began to search through the works of great
philosophers and religious thinkers. While in High School he
encountered a literature teacher who had been part of the
Confessing Church during World War II. He encouraged Pannenberg to
take a hard look at [Christianity](Christianity "Christianity"). At
this time Pannenberg experienced an "intellectual conversion" and
decided that Christianity was the best available religious option.
This propelled him into his vocation as a theologian.
