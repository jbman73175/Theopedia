**Woman in the World of Jesus**^[[1]](#note-0)^ is a book written
by classicist Evelyn Stagg and renowned Baptist theologian Dr.
Frank Stagg. It was published in 1978 by Westminster Press in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

This book explains woman's role in the church today by explaining
what it was like for woman in the world into which Jesus was born.

The book describes:

-   The status of woman in the world Jesus entered
-   The position of Jesus with respect to women
-   The status of women in the church as reflected in the New
    Testament.

The authors show how woman was perceived, how she was treated, and
how she saw herself.

The three divisions of the book:

-   Part I describes the Jewish-Greek-Roman world that bears most
    directly upon the world in which Jesus lived.
-   Part II is concerned with Jesus' manner, teaching, and
    post-resurrection appearances to women.
-   Part III investigates perspectives on woman in the writings of
    Paul, the early Domestic Code embedded in the New Testament, the
    Synoptic Gospels, the book of Acts of the Apostles, and the
    Johannine literature|writings of the Apostle John.

## Overview

The book opens with an in-depth probe of the ancient world to see
how woman fared in the eras leading up to the birth of Jesus.

The book is written from a Christian perspective. The basic concern
behind the book is to understand the intention of Jesus for woman,
in which light the past performance of the church may be tested and
directions for the church today may be sought. The authors
expressed their intent to make Jesus the heart of the book. Their
basic assumption in the book is that the New Testament, in
particular the tradition centering in Jesus himself, as revealed in
the Synoptic Gospels, remains for Christians their basic and
authoritative witness for seeking direction.

A further contention of the authors is that Jesus founded the
church, and that the church from the first has struggled to
understand him and to follow him. In that regard, the Staggs
contrast the teachings of Jesus that "whoever does the will of God
is my mother, and my brother, and my sister" (Mark 3:35) and "in
Christ there is no male nor female"(Galatians 3:28) to commands in
the early Christian church for women to wear veils (1 Corinthians
11:5, 10), keep silent in church (1 Corinthians 14:34), and the
judgment that "women are not worthy of life. "^[[2]](#note-1)^

The Staggs believe that the six *antitheses* ("You have heard it
was said...but I say unto you...") of Matthew 5:21-48 are evidence
that Jesus intended to *correct* his heritage.

> The radical correctiveness of Jesus to his religious heritage are
> apparent throughout the Gospels, and there should be no surprise
> that this holds for what he did for woman. The Christian
> hermeneutic which sees Jesus as both respectful of his heritage and
> exercising a lordship over it is both compelled by the New
> Testament and visible to the piety today which esteems and
> cherishes all Scripture yet worships Christ the Lord above all. By
> the same token, Jesus must be Lord over his church, the one by whom
> it is to be measured and corrected today." (pp. 10-11)

    tells Jesus: "Tell Mary to leave us, "for women are not worthy of
    life. " Although that book does not appear in today's Canonical
    gospels, it was widely circulated in the early church. Many church
    fathers began to preach that Jesus had died to rid the world of
    Adam’s sin. The source of that sin, they said, was Eve. In the
    third century, the prolific defender of the orthodox church,
    Tertullian, wrote: "On account of [women]…even the Son of God had
    to die." Burstein, Dan and Arne J. de Keijzer. "Preface. "
