The **Word of Faith** movement or **word-faith theology** developed
in the latter half of the 20th century in mainly
[Pentecostal](Pentecostalism "Pentecostalism") and
[Charismatic](Charismatic "Charismatic") churches. Its beginnings
trace back to an early twentieth century evangelical pastor, E.W.
Kenyon (1867-1948), who preached that God would award financial and
other gifts if the faithful would ask. Kenyon coined the phrase,
"What I confess, I possess."
[Kenneth E. Hagin](Kenneth_Hagin "Kenneth Hagin") is often credited
with being the father of the modern Word of Faith movement, using a
four-part formula he claimed to have received from Jesus: "Say it;
do it; receive it; tell it."

Proponents of the doctrine include Oral Roberts, Kenneth & Gloria
Copeland, [Kenneth Hagin](Kenneth_Hagin "Kenneth Hagin"), Jerry
Savelle, Charles Capps, Bill Winston, Creflo Dollar, Charles
Nieman, Hobart Freeman, [Benny Hinn](Benny_Hinn "Benny Hinn"),
[Joel Osteen](Joel_Osteen "Joel Osteen"),
[Joyce Meyer](Joyce_Meyer "Joyce Meyer"),
[T.D. Jakes](index.php?title=T.D._Jakes&action=edit&redlink=1 "T.D. Jakes (page does not exist)"),
and Marilyn Hickey, among others. They teach that Christians must
claim the grace God has promised them, whether in material goods,
health, social position, or roles within the church.

## Teachings

### Faith

Probably the most distinctive teaching of the word-faith movement
is "an idealized and prescriptive conception of faith that
diminishes the relational and personal dimensions of Christian
spirituality... [They push] the logic of faith to an idealized and
absolute conclusion"
[[1]](http://www.eauk.org/theology/key_papers/upload/PROSPERITY%20CONCLUSIONS.pdf).

### Health and material prosperity

The word-faith movement promotes "an enthusiasm for material
prosperity as a concrete expression of the goodness of God towards
his people that is difficult to square with the high value placed,
for various reasons, on poverty in the Bible, and which is likely
to compromise the church s prophetic voice."
[[2]](http://www.eauk.org/theology/key_papers/upload/PROSPERITY%20CONCLUSIONS.pdf)

The "health and wealth" teachings have been heavily criticized for
avoiding scripture that warns against material prosperity (eg. Luke
6:20, Matthew 19:24, Ezekiel 16:49, James 2:5) and tells of the
importance of helping the poor (eg. Isaiah 58:5-7, Luke 12:33 Mark
10:21, Acts 20:35, Psalm 82:1-5; Proverbs 19:17, 21:13, 22:9,
24:31, 29:7; Luke 20:37-42, Acts 10:5).

*See main page: [Prosperity gospel](Prosperity_gospel "Prosperity gospel")*
### Salvation history

The word-faith movement teaches "a narrative of salvation history
that is at odds with mainstream evangelical thinking at a number of
crucial points"
[[3]](http://www.eauk.org/theology/key_papers/upload/PROSPERITY%20CONCLUSIONS.pdf).

## Christ's Spiritual Death

"Spiritual death means something more than separation from God.
Spiritual death also means having Satan's nature. Jesus tasted
death, spiritual death, for every man."
([Kenneth E. Hagin](Kenneth_Hagin "Kenneth Hagin"), The Name of
Jesus (Tulsa, OK: [Kenneth Hagin](Kenneth_Hagin "Kenneth Hagin")
Ministries, 1981), 31.

"The righteousness of God was made to be sin. He accepted the sin
nature of Satan in His own spirit. And at the moment that He did
so, He cried, "My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken Me?" You don
t know what happened at the cross. Why do you think Moses, upon
instruction of God, raised the serpent upon that pole instead of a
lamb? That used to bug me. I said, "Why in the world would you want
to put a snake up there the sign of Satan? Why didn t you put a
lamb on that pole?" And the Lord said, "Because it was a sign of
Satan that was hanging on the cross." He said, "I accepted, in My
own spirit, spiritual death; and the light was turned off."
(Kenneth Copeland, "What Happened from the Cross to the Throne"
(Fort Worth, TX: Kenneth Copeland Ministries, 1990), audiotape
\#02-0017, side 2.

"He (Jesus) accepted the sin nature of Satan in His own spirit."
(Kenneth Copeland; "Christianity in Crisis" by Hank Hanegraaf, pg.
157-158, quoted in "Kingdom of the Cults" by Walter Martin, pg.
501)

## Man's Divinity

"I am a little God! Critics be gone" (Paul Crouch, "Praise the
Lord," TBN, July 7, 1986, quoted in "The kingdom of the Cults" by
Walter Martin pg. 504)

"We are a class of Gods! You don't have a god in you, you are one."
(Kenneth Copeland, leader of Kenneth Copeland Ministries;
"Christianity in Crisis" by Hank Hanegraaf, pgs. 110, 116, quoted
in "Kingdom of the Cults" by Walter Martin, pg. 504)

"The eternal life He (God) came to give us is the nature of
God...It is, in reality, God imparting His very nature, substance,
and being to our human spirits...Many in the great body of Full
Gospel people do not know that the new birth is a real incarnation.
They do not know that they are as much sons as daughters of God as
Jesus...Jesus was first divine, and then he was human. SoHe was in
the flesh a divine human being. I was first human, and so were you,
but I was born of God, so I became a human-divine being."
([Kenneth Hagin](Kenneth_Hagin "Kenneth Hagin"), "ZOE: The God-Kind
of Life," (1989): 1-2,27,40, quoted in "Kingdom of the Cults" by
Walter Martin, pg. 505)

"The believer is as much an incarnation as was Jesus of Nazareth."
([Kenneth Hagin](Kenneth_Hagin "Kenneth Hagin") "The Incarnation"
in the Word of Faith, Dec. 1980: 14, quoted in "Kingdom of the
Cults" by Walter Martin, pg. 505)

"We are the Word made flesh, just as Jesus was." (Gloria Copeland,
Kenneth Copeland Ministries; Crenshaw, "Man of God", 202, quoted in
"Kingdom of the Cults" by Walter Martin, pg. 505)

## Other info

-   Proponents of the Word of Faith movement promote a trichotomous
    view of the nature of man (cf.
    [Nature of man](Nature_of_man "Nature of man")).

## Quotes

-   "There is a marked desire to shock, which goes with the
    showmanship of the Word of Faith movement but which may also echo
    the background buzz of polemic and debate with mainstream
    Christianity. Word of Faith teachers have a habit of making
    theologically provocative statements that may appear much less
    scandalous when unpacked. The tabloid theologizing is designed to
    disrupt traditional assumptions and generate excitement about the
    life of faith on a routine basis."
