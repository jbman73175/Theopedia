The term **worldview** "literally derives from a German term that
means 'view of the world.' It is the conceptual framework through
which one views all of life and evaluates it."

"The purpose of worldview studies is nothing less than to liberate
Christianity from its cultural captivity, unleashing its power to
transform the world... Genuine worldview thinking is far more than
a mental strategy or a new spin on current events. At the core, it
is a deepening of our spiritual character and the character of our
lives." - [Nancy Pearcey](Nancy_Pearcey "Nancy Pearcey"),
