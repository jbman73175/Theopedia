**Worship** is an active response to the character, words and
actions of God, initiated by His revelation and enabled by His
redemption, whereby the mind is transformed (e.g. belief,
repentance), the heart is renewed (e.g. love, trust), and actions
are surrendered (e.g. obedience, service), all in accordance with
His will and in order to declare His infinite worthiness.

In both Hebrew and Greek, there are two categories of words for
worship. The first is about body language that demonstrates respect
and submission; to bow down, to kneel, to prostrate oneself. The
second is about doing something for God that demonstrates sacrifice
and obedience; to offer, to serve.

## Biblical words for worship

### Hebrew

-   shâchâh
    (^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#7812](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=7812&version=nas)]*^)
    This term literally means *to depress* or *prostrate oneself*, and
    is translated in the
    [King James Version](King_James_Version "King James Version") of
    the [Old Testament](Old_Testament "Old Testament") as "worship"
    (100 times), "bow down" (54 times), "do obeisance" (9 times), "do
    reverence" (5 times), "fall down" (Psa 72:11; Isa 45:14;), "crouch"
    (1 Sam 2:36), "humbly beseech" (2 Sam 16:4), or "make to stoop"
    (Pro 12:25).

-   ‛âbad
    (^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#5647](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=5647&version=nas)]*^)
    This term literally means to work in any sense, but by implication
    *to serve* or *enslave*. It is used more than 250 times in the Old
    Testament, most often translated as "serve" and 31 times in
    conjunction with *shâchâh* (see above). However, three times the
    translators of the
    [ESV](English_Standard_Version "English Standard Version") chose
    the word "worship" (2 Sam 15:8; Psa 102:22; Isa 19:21).

-   dârash
    (^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#1875](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=1875&version=nas)]*^)
    In Ezra 4:2 and 6:21, the ESV translates this term meaning
    *to seek* as "worship".

-   yârê'
    (^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#3372](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=3372&version=nas)]*^)
    In Joshua 22:25, the ESV translates this term meaning *to fear* as
    "worship".

-   ‛âtsab
    (^*[[Strong's](Strong's_Concordance\ "Strong's\ Concordance")\ [\#6087](http://www.biblestudytools.net/Lexicons/Hebrew/heb.cgi?number=6087&version=nas)]*^)
    In Jeremiah 44:19, where the KJV translates this term meaning
    *to carve* or *fashion* as "worship", the ESV renders it as "made
    cakes for her *bearing her image*..."

## Definitions

-   "Worship is the believer's response of all that they are –
    mind, emotions, will, body – to what God is and says and does"
    ^[[1]](#note-0)^
-   "Christians believe that true worship is the highest and
    noblest activity of which man, by the grace of God, is
    capable"^[[2]](#note-1)^
-   "Worship of the living and true God is essentially an
    engagement with him on the terms that he proposes and in the way
    that he alone makes possible"^[[3]](#note-2)^
-   "Worship is the submission of all our nature to God. It is the
    quickening of conscience by His holiness; the nourishment of mind
    with His truth; the purifying of imagination by His Beauty; the
    opening of the heart to His love; the surrender of will to His
    purpose – and all of this gathered up in adoration, the most
    selfless emotion of which our nature is capable and therefore the
    chief remedy for that self-centeredness which is our original sin
    and the source of all actual sin" ^[[4]](#note-3)^
-   "Worship is the activity of the new life of a believer in
    which, recognizing the fullness of the Godhead as it is revealed in
    the person of Jesus Christ and His mighty redemptive acts, he seeks
    by the power of the Holy Spirit to render to the living God the
    glory, honor, and submission which are His due"^[[5]](#note-4)^
-   "Worship is the human response to the self-revelation of the
    triune God, which involves: (1) divine initiation in which God
    graciously reveals himself, his purposes, and will; (2) a spiritual
    and personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ enabled by
    the ministry of the Holy Spirit; and (3) a response by the
    worshiper of joyful adoration, reverence, humility, submission and
    obedience"^[[6]](#note-5)^
