## William Townsend

[William Cameron Townsend](index.php?title=William_Cameron_Townsend&action=edit&redlink=1 "William Cameron Townsend (page does not exist)")
founded WBT in 1942. Townsend discovered most of the Cakchiquel
Indians where he was working were not interested in the Spanish
Bible he was selling. He spent the next twelve years translating
the Bible for the Cakchiquel. After finishing the Cakchiquel New
Testament, he could have spent the rest of his career ministering
in the Cakchiquel church. But Townsend resolved that other language
groups should also be able to read the Bible in their own language.
Borrowing from the name of the
[Reformation](Reformation "Reformation") figure
[John Wycliffe](John_Wycliffe "John Wycliffe"), Townsend founded
"Camp Wycliffe" in 1934 as a linguistics training school. However,
he knew he could not translate the Bible into every language by
himself and so he founded WBT in order to translate the Scriptures
for people groups around the world. Today, more than 5,000 people
work with Wycliffe Bible Translators.

Wycliffe's Summer Institute of Linguistics as well as WBT work
together to translate Scripture, train field personnel, and promote
interest in translation. They have already translated the
[New Testament](New_Testament "New Testament") for more than five
hundred people groups, and their goal is to begin a translation
into every language lacking one by 2025.
