The **Tetragrammaton** (Greek meaning *word with four letters*) is
the usual reference to the Hebrew name for [God](God "God"), which
is transliterated from the Hebrew as **YHWH** -- four consonants
with no vowels; it is the distinctive personal name of the God of
Israel. The popular vocalized form of YHWH is **Yahweh.**

Of all the names of [God](God "God"), the one which occurs most
frequently is the Tetragrammaton. The
[Biblia Hebraica](Masoretic_text "Masoretic text") texts each
contain the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) 6,828 times.

In Judaism, the Tetragrammaton is the ineffable name of God, and is
not read aloud. In the reading aloud of the scripture or in prayer,
it is replaced with *Adonai* (Lord). Other written forms such as ד׳
or ה׳ are read as *Hashem* (the Name), for the same reason.

One theory regarding the disuse of the Tetragrammaton is that the
Jewish taboo on its pronunciation was so strong that the original
pronunciation may have been lost somewhere in the first millennium.
Since then, many scholars (particularly
[Christians](Christian "Christian")) have sought to reconstruct its
original pronunciation. For example, circa 1518 Christian
theologians introduced the pronunciation *Yehovah* based on the
written form with the vowel pointing for [Adonai](Adonai "Adonai").
This is generally held to be implausible but gave rise to alternate
vocalizations such as Jahovah and Jehovah.

The theory regarding the disuse of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) is the
result of an interpretation of the Third of the Ten Commandments.
The Jewish people stopped saying the Name by the 3rd century out of
fear of violating the commandment
*"You shall not take the name of YHWH your God in vain"* (Exodus
20:7).

It is possible that the practice was in effect prior to early
Christian times as Jesus prayed to the Father
"*I have made your name known*" (John 17:26).

## Meaning

According to one Jewish tradition, the Tetragrammaton is related to
the causative form, the imperfect state, of the Hebrew verb הוה
(*ha·wah*, "to be, to become"), meaning "He will cause to become"
(usually understood as "He causes to become").

Another tradition regards the name as coming from three different
verb forms sharing the same root YWH, the words HYH *haya* (היה):
"He was"; HWH *howê* (הוה): "He is"; and YHYH *yihiyê* (יהיה): "He
will be". This would therefore show that God is timeless and
self-existent. Other interpretations include the name as meaning "I
am the One Who Is." This can be seen in the O. T. biblical account
of the "burning bush" commanding [Moses](Moses "Moses") to tell the
sons of Israel that "I AM (אהיה) has sent you,"
([Exodus](Exodus "Exodus") 3:13-14). Some suggest, "I AM the One I
AM" [אהיה אשר אהיה]. This may also fit the interpretation as "He
Causes to Become."
