Zacharias Ursinus
**Zacharias Ursinus** (1534-1583), a sixteenth century German
[theologian](Theologian "Theologian"), born Zacharias Baer in
Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland). Like all young scholars of that era
he gave himself a Latin name from *ursus*, meaning bear. He is best
known as a professor of theology at the University of Heidelberg
and co-author with Caspar Olevianus (1536-1587) of the
[Heidelberg Catechism](Heidelberg_Catechism "Heidelberg Catechism").

At age fifteen he enrolled at Wittenberg University, boarding for
the next seven years with
[Philipp Melanchthon](Philipp_Melanchthon "Philipp Melanchthon"),
the erudite successor of
[Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"). Melanchthon admired
young Ursinus for his intellectual gifts and his spiritual
maturity, commending him to mentors throughout Europe. Subsequently
Ursinus studied under [Reformation](Reformation "Reformation")
scholars at Strasbourg, Basel, Lausanne, and Geneva. Sojourns in
Lyons and Orleans gave him expertise in Hebrew. Returning to
Breslau he published a pamphlet on the sacraments, which aroused
the ire of Lutherans who charged him with being more Reformed than
Lutheran. The Breslau opponents’ vitriolic reaction succeeded in
driving him out of the city from whence he moved to Zurich and
became friends with [Peter Martyr](Peter_Martyr "Peter Martyr"),
the Italian Reformer.

In 1561, upon Peter Martyr's recommendation, Prince Frederick III,
elector palatine, appointed him professor in the Collegium
Sapientiae at Heidelberg, where in 1563, having been commissioned
by the Prince elector, he completed the Heidelberg Catechism in
cooperation with Olevianus. The death of the Prince elector in 1576
led to the removal of Ursinus, who then occupied a professorial
chair at Neustadt an der Haardt from 1578 until his death in 1583.

His Works were published in 1587-1589, and a more complete edition
by his son and two of his pupils, Pareus and Reuterus, in 1612.
